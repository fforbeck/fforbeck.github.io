The Claim Notice shall include (x) a reasonable description of the facts and circumstances which relate to the subject matter of such indemnification claim to the extent then known and (u) the amount of Losses suffered by the Indemnified Party in connection with the claim to the extent known or reasonably estimable.

^^In the case of any claim for indemnification under this Article VII arising from a claim of a third party (including any Governmental Authority) (a “***Third Party Claim***”), the Indemnified Party must give a Claim Notice with respect to such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly (but in no event later than thirty (30) days) after the Indemnified Party’s receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim; provided, that the failure to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the defense of such Third Party Claim is materially and irrevocably prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend and to direct the defense against any such Third Party Claim in its name and at its expense, and with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party fails to acknowledge fully to the Indemnified Party the obligations of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days after receiving notice of such Third Party Claim or contests, in whole or in part, its indemnification obligations therefor or (ii) at any time while such Third Party Claim is pending, (A) the applicable third party alleges a Fraud Claim, or (B) such claim is criminal in nature, could reasonably be expected to lead to criminal proceedings, or seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. If Indemnifying Party elects, and is entitled, to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, it will within twenty (20) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so, and the Indemnified Party will, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, cooperate in the defense of such Third Party Claim. If Indemnifying Party elects not to, or at any time is not entitled under this Section 7.4 to, compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election as herein provided or refuses to acknowledge or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or defend such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Indemnifying Party will have no indemnification obligations with respect to any such Third Party Claim which is settled by the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party will not be required to refrain from paying any Third Party Claim which has matured by a final, non-appealable Order, nor will it be required to refrain from paying any Third Party Claim where the delay in paying such claim would result in the foreclosure of a Lien upon any of the property or assets then held by the Indemnified Party or where any delay in payment would cause the Indemnified Party material economic loss. The Indemnifying Party’s right to direct the defense will include the right to compromise or enter into an agreement settling any Third Party Claim; provided, that no such compromise or settlement will obligate the Indemnified Party to agree to any settlement that that requires the taking or restriction of any action (including the payment of money and competition restrictions) by the Indemnified Party other than the execution of a release for such Third Party Claim and/or agreeing to be subject to customary confidentiality obligations in connection therewith, except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent to be withheld, conditioned or delayed only for a good faith reason). Notwithstanding the Indemnifying Party’s right to compromise or settle in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party may not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim over the objection of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that consent by the Indemnified Party to settlement or compromise will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party’s right to direct the defense.

^^With respect to any direct indemnification claim that is not a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice to respond thereto. If the Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty (30) days, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted responsibility for the Losses set forth in such Claim and will have no further right to contest the validity of such Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party responds within such thirty (30) days and rejects such claim in whole or in part, the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available under this Agreement, any Ancillary Documents or applicable Law.

^^Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, except with respect to Fraud Claims or claims seeking injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief (including pursuant to Section 8.6), or indemnification pursuant to this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the Parties with respect to matters arising under this Agreement of any kind or nature, including for any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant, or other provision contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, including the negotiation and discussion thereof.
