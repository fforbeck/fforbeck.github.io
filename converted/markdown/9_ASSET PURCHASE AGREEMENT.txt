Abstract
Systems and methods for scoring geographic locations and for providing related searching tools are disclosed herein. According to an aspect, a method includes receiving one or more property identifiers. The method also includes receiving geographic attributes for the one or more property identifiers. Further, the method includes assigning, for each of the one or more property identifiers, a weighting to each geographic attribute based on a distance of a property associated with the property identifier from a location of the geographic attribute. Further, the method includes assigning, for each of the one or more property identifiers, a score to the property identifier based on one or more weightings to the geographic attributes for the property identifier.
