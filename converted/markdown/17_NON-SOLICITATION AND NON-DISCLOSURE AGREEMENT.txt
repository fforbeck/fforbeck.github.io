\centered **Non-Solicitation and Non-Disclosure Agreement** 

[[Party 1]] (the “Company” as defined below) and Employee, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which hereby are acknowledged, knowingly and voluntarily agree as follows: 

^**Representations and Acknowledgments.** 

^^**Consideration.** In consideration for Employee’s agreement to enter into this Non-Solicitation and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the “**Agreement**”) and to be bound by its terms, Employee has received: (i) employment or continued employment; (ii) access to Company relationships and Confidential Information described herein; (iii) the ability to participate in the Company’s Points of Focus program, a Company stock incentive plan, and/or other similar Company-sponsored programs or plans; and/or (iv) other good and valuable consideration. 

^^**Confidential Information and Goodwill.** The Company agrees that upon the commencement of Employee’s employment (if a new Employee) or continuation of employment coinciding with the Employee’s execution of this Agreement (if a current Employee), the Company will make available, give Employee access to, allow Employee to become familiar with, and allow Employee to acquire knowledge of the Company, its Customers, employees, operations, pricing methods, delivery schedules, sources of supply, vendor information, supplier arrangements, shipping and routing procedures and schedules, order routing and/or freight management software, specialized routine and/or freight management strategy and procedures, financial information, and other Confidential Information of the Company and its Customers that will assist and enhance Employee’s ability to perform Employee’s duties with the Company. Employee recognizes that Employee, on behalf of the Company, will develop close relationships with, gain special knowledge of, and promote and develop the loyalty of said customers and vendors. The Company’s Confidential Information, the goodwill of its customers and vendors, and its relationship with its employees have been and will continue to be developed through the Company’s investment of substantial time, effort and money. Employee further recognizes that Employee is in a position to unfairly convert the Company’s business, customer accounts, vendor relationships and goodwill of customers, vendors and employees for use by Employee and other Persons in competition with the Company, and that this would cause the Company to suffer immediate and irreparable injury. 

^^**No Other Agreement or Understanding.** Employee represents and warrants that Employee is not a party to any agreement or understanding which would impair Employee’s ability to enter into this Agreement or otherwise preclude or restrict Employee’s employment with the Company, and that Employee’s execution of this Agreement and employment with the Company will not violate any other agreement or understanding to which Employee is bound. 

^^**Survival.** If, after executing this Agreement, Employee: (i) is promoted to, assigned to or otherwise assumes one or more positions or functions other than or in addition to Employee’s position or functions at the time Employee signed this Agreement, regardless of title, or (ii) is transferred or assigned to or otherwise works for any affiliate, subsidiary or other division or business unit of the Company, the terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply with full force and effect. Employee acknowledges and understands that unless and until a subsequent written Agreement is signed by all parties to this Agreement that expressly supersedes this Agreement, this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. 

^^**PRESERVATION OF AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP.** EMPLOYEE AGREES THAT NO PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO CREATE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT OR A PROMISE OF EMPLOYMENT FOR ANY SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME. EMPLOYEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT EMPLOYEE’S EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY IS “AT WILL” (UNLESS EMPLOYEE ENTERED INTO A WRITTEN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT EXPRESSLY PROVIDING THAT HIS/HER EMPLOYMENT IS NOT AT WILL AND SIGNED BY AN OFFICER OF [[Party 1]] WHO IS AUTHORIZED TO DO SO) AND CAN BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME BY THE COMPANY OR EMPLOYEE, WITH OR WITHOUT REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE, AND WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.
