^^A Participant whose benefits under the Savings Plan are limited by one or more of the Applicable Limitations shall be eligible for a supplemental savings benefit under this Plan in an amount equal to:

^^^the aggregate amount of Employer Contributions (including any reallocation of amounts forfeited upon the termination of employment of others participating in the Savings Plan) that would have been credited to the Participant's account under the Savings Plan in the absence of the Applicable Limitations if for all relevant periods he had made the maximum amount of elective deferrals under section 402(g) of the Code or voluntary employee contributions under section 401(a) of the Code required to qualify for the maximum possible allocation of Employer Contributions (and without regard to the amount of elective deferrals or voluntary employee contributions actually made); over

adjusted for earnings and losses as provided in section 3.2(b); provided, however, that if the Participant dies before the payment of such supplemental savings benefit begins, no benefit shall be payable under this section 3.2 and the survivor benefit, if any, which may be payable shall be determined under section 4.2.

The balance credited to such bookkeeping account shall be adjusted for distributions, withdrawals, earnings or losses as follows:

^^^except as provided in section 3.2(b)(ii), the balance credited to such bookkeeping account shall be credited with interest as of the last day of each calendar month at a rate for such month equal to one-twelfth of the annualized yield on 30-year Treasury Securities, Constant Maturities, prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for such month pursuant to section 417(e) of the Code; or

^^^if and to the extent permitted by the Committee, as though such Employer Contributions had been contributed to a trust fund and invested, for the benefit of the Participant, in such investments at such time or times as the Participant shall have designated in such form and manner as the Committee shall prescribe.

^^^The balance credited to the bookkeeping account shall be reduced for any distributions or withdrawals.

^^Effective [[Date 4: Date]], the balance credited to the bookkeeping accounts of Messrs. Timothy King and Michael Pucella under this section 3.2 shall be adjusted as follows:

^^^in the case of Mr. King, the balance credited to his a bookkeeping account shall be credited with an additional Seven Thousand Seven Hundred Sixty-Eight Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]); and

^^^any such election shall not take effect until twelve (12) months after it is received by the Committee;

^^^in the case of an election to defer a payment to be made on account of an event other than the Participant’s death, Disability or Unforeseeable Emergency, the first payment made under such election shall not occur until at least five (5) years later than such payment would otherwise have been made (or begin to be made); and

^^^any such election is subject to the restrictions in section 5.1.

^***Supplemental ESOP Benefits.***

^^^for each period for which an allocation of Shares is made under the ESOP, a number of Stock Units the excess of (A) the number of Shares that bears the same relationship to such Participant's compensation taken into account in determining allocations under the ESOP (without regard to any limit on such compensation pursuant to any Applicable Limitation) as the number of Shares allocated for such period under the ESOP to an individual whose allocation is not limited by any Applicable Limitation bears to such person's compensation taken into account in determining allocations under the ESOP over (b) the actual number of Shares allocated to such Participant under the ESOP for such period, taking into account in both cases Shares allocated as a result of forfeitures; and

^^^if and to the extent that Employer Contributions to the ESOP result in allocations to the Participant's account of assets other than Shares for any period, an amount for each period equal to the excess (if any) of (A) the dollar amount that bears the same relationship to such Participant's compensation taken into account in allocating Employer Contributions under the ESOP (without regard to any limit on such compensation pursuant to any Applicable Limitation) as the dollar amount of Employer Contributions allocated for such period under the ESOP to an individual whose allocation is not limited by any Applicable Limitation bears to such person's compensation taken into account in determining allocations under the ESOP over (b) the actual dollar amount of Employer Contributions allocated to such Participant under the ESOP for such period, taking into account in both cases dollar amounts allocated as a result of forfeitures.

adjusted for earnings and losses as provided in section 3.3(b); provided, however, that if the Participant dies before the payment of such supplemental ESOP benefit begins, no benefit shall be payable under this section 3.3 and the survivor benefit, if any, which may be payable shall be determined under section 4.3.

^^The Committee shall cause to be maintained a bookkeeping account to reflect all Shares and Employer Contributions (including any reallocation of amounts forfeited upon the termination of employment of others participating in the ESOP) that cannot be allocated to a Participant's account under the ESOP due to the Applicable Limitations and amounts under section 3.3(c), and shall cause such bookkeeping account to be credited with such Employer Contributions and Stock Units reflecting such Shares as of the date on which such Employer Contributions and Shares, respectively, would have been credited to the Participant's account in the ESOP in the absence of the Applicable Limitations. The balance credited to such bookkeeping account shall be adjusted for distributions, withdrawals, earnings or losses as follows:

^^^all Stock Units shall be adjusted from time to time so that the value of a Stock Unit on any date is equal to the Fair Market Value of Share on such date and the number of Stock Units shall be adjusted as and when appropriate to reflect any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, exchange, conversion, or other event generally affecting the number of Shares held by all holders of Shares; and

^^^(A) except as provided in section 3.3(b)(ii)(B), the balance credited to such bookkeeping account that does not consist of Stock Units shall be credited with interest as of the last day of each calendar month at a rate for such month equal to one twelfth of the annualized yield on 30-year Treasury Securities, Constant Maturities, prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for such month pursuant to section 417(e) of the Code; or

^if and to the extent permitted by the Committee, the balance credited to such bookkeeping account that does not consist of Stock Units shall be adjusted as though such Employer Contributions had been contributed to a trust find and invested, for the benefit of the Participant, in such investments at such time or times as the Participant shall have designated in such form and manner as the Committee shall prescribe;

^^^The balance credited to the bookkeeping account shall be reduced for any distributions or withdrawals.

provided, however, that to the extent that the Participant shall receive on a current basis any dividend paid with respect to Shares credited to his account under the ESOP, the bookkeeping account established for him under this Plan shall not be adjusted to reflect such dividend and, instead, the Participant shall be paid an amount per Stock Unit equal to the dividend par Share received by the Participant under the ESOP, at substantially the same time as such dividend is paid under the ESOP.

^^Effective [[Date 4]], the balance credited to the bookkeeping accounts of Messrs. Timothy King and Michael Pucella under this section 3.3 shall be adjusted as follows:

^^^in the case of Mr. King, the balance credited to his a bookkeeping account shall be credited with an additional Twenty-Seven Thousand Sixty-Nine Dollars ($[[USD Value 3: Number]]); and

^^^in the case of Mr. Pucella, the balance credited to his bookkeeping account shall be credited with an additional Twenty-Two Thousand Five Hundred Seventy-Three Dollars ($[[USD Value 4: Number]]).

^^The supplemental ESOP benefit payable to a Participant hereunder shall be paid in a single lump sum within the first thirty days of the calendar year in which the Participant's Termination of Service occurs and shall be in an amount equal to the balance credited to his bookkeeping account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may, subject to the restrictions in section 5.1, within thirty (30) days after first becoming eligible to participate in the Plan for purposes of receiving a supplemental ESOP benefit, elect that such supplemental ESOP benefit (to the extent that such benefit is attributable to compensation for services performed after such election) be paid in a different form or commencing at a different time by filing a written election, in such form and manner as the Committee may prescribe, within such thirty (30) day period.

^^Notwithstanding section 3.3(d), subject to the consent of the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, each Participant may, by written election given in such form and manner as the Committee may prescribe, elect to change the time and manner of distribution of the balance credited to the supplemental retirement benefit; provided, however, that:

^^^any such election shall not take effect until twelve (12) months after it is received by the Committee;

^^^in the case of an election to defer a payment to be made on account of an event other than the Participant’s death, Disability or Unforeseeable Emergency, the first payment made under such election shall not occur until at least five (5) years later than such payment would otherwise have been made (or begin to be made); and

^^^any such election is subject to the restrictions in section 5.1.

**ARTICLE IV**

If a Participant who is eligible for a supplemental retirement benefit under section 3.1 dies before the payment of such benefit begins, a supplemental survivor's retirement benefit shall be payable to the Participant's Beneficiary under this Plan in amount equal to the excess (if any) of (a) the survivor's benefit that would have been payable under the Retirement Plan commencing at the earliest permissible date in the absence of the Applicable Limitations if the Participant had effectively designated such Beneficiary as his beneficiary under the Retirement Plan, over (b) the survivor's benefit would have been payable under the Retirement Plan commencing at the earliest permissible date after giving effect too the Applicable Limitations if the Participate had effectively designated such Beneficiary as his beneficiary under the Retirement Plan. Such benefit shall be paid in a single lump sum which is the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit described in the preceding sentence within the first thirty days of the calendar year following the death of the Participant.

^***Supplemental Savings Plan Death Benefits.***

If a Participant who is eligible for a supplemental savings benefit under section 3.2 dies before the payment of such benefit begins, a supplemental survivor's savings benefit shall be payable to the Participant's Beneficiary under this Plan in amount equal to the balance credited to the bookkeeping account established for the Participant under section 3.2(b). Such benefit shall be paid in a single lump within the first thirty days of the calendar year following the death of the Participant and the bookkeeping account established for such Participant pursuant to section 3.2(b) shall continue to be adjusted as provided therein through the last day of the last calendar month to end prior to the date of payment.

If a Participant or Former Participant shall die without having effectively named a Beneficiary, he shall be deemed to have named his estate as his sole Beneficiary. If a Participant or Former Participant and his designated Beneficiary shall die in circumstances which give rise to doubt as to which of them shall have been the first to die, the Participant or Former Participant shall be deemed to have survived the Beneficiary. If a Participant or Former Participant designates more than one Beneficiary, all shall be deemed to have equal shares unless the Participant or Former Participant shall expressly provide otherwise.

In the event that payment is to be made in installments, each installment shall be equal to the balance credited to the Participant’s Memorandum Account (or, if applicable, the portion of such Participant’s Memorandum Account attributable to sections 3.2 or 3.3 of this Plan) as of the last day of the quarter ending immediately prior to the date on which payment is to be made, divided by the number of installment payments remaining to be paid (including the payment then being computed).

^***Mandatory Cashout of Small Balances.***
