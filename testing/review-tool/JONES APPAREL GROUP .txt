^\centered THE SECURITIES 

Section 2.01.  Form of Securities. Provisions relating to the Securities are set forth in the Appendix attached hereto (the “**Appendix**”), which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Securities and the Trustee’s certificate of authentication shall each be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, which are hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Indenture. 

Section 2.02.  Denominations. The Securities shall be issuable in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.01. In the absence of any such provisions with respect to the Securities, the Securities denominated in Dollars shall be issuable in denominations of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] and integral multiples of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] in excess thereof. 

Section 2.03.  Forms Generally. The Securities may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, securities exchange rule, agreements to which any Issuer is subject, if any, or usage (*provided* that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Issuers). Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. 

The Definitive Securities shall be printed, lithographed or engraved on steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined by the Officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution thereof. 

Section 2.04.  Execution, Authentication and Delivery. One or more Officers of the Issuers shall sign the Securities on behalf of the Issuers by manual or facsimile signature. The Issuers’ seal, if any, shall be impressed, affixed, imprinted or reproduced on the Securities and may be in facsimile form. 

If an Officer of the Issuers whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless. 

^Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture. 

The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery Securities as set forth in the Appendix. 

^^^^^ 
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Issuers to authenticate the Securities. Any such appointment shall be evidenced by an instrument signed by a Trust Officer, a copy of which shall be furnished to the Issuers. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands. 

Section 2.05.  Registrar and Paying Agent. The Issuers shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the “**Registrar**”) and an office or agency where Securities may be presented for payment (the “**Paying Agent**”). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Issuers may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term “Paying Agent” includes any additional paying agent, and the term “Registrar” includes any co-registrars. The Issuers initially appoint the Trustee as (a) Registrar and Paying Agent in connection with the Securities and (b) the Securities Custodian with respect to the Global Securities. 

The Issuers shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar or Paying Agent not a party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate the terms of the TIA. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Issuers shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Issuers fail to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. The Issuers or any of their domestically organized Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar. 

The Issuers may remove any Registrar or Paying Agent upon written notice to such Registrar or Paying Agent and to the Trustee; *provided*, *however*, that no such removal shall become effective until (1) acceptance of an appointment by a successor as evidenced by an appropriate agreement entered into by the Issuers and such successor Registrar or Paying Agent, as the case may be, and delivered to the Trustee or (2) notification to the Trustee that the Trustee shall serve as Registrar or Paying Agent until the appointment of a successor in accordance with clause (1) above. The Registrar or Paying Agent may resign at any time upon written notice; *provided*, *however*, that the Trustee may resign as Paying Agent or Registrar only if the Trustee also resigns as Trustee in accordance with Section 7.08. 

Section 2.06.  Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust. On or before each due date of the principal and interest on the Securities, the Issuers shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or if an Issuer or a Subsidiary of any Issuer is acting as Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto) a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest when so becoming due. The Issuers shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Issuers in making any such payment. If an Issuer or a Subsidiary of an Issuer acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Issuers at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee. 

Section 2.07.  Securityholder Lists. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Securityholders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Issuers shall furnish, or cause the Registrar to furnish, to the Trustee, 

^^^^^ 
in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Securityholders. 

Section 2.08.  Transfer and Exchange. The Securities shall be issued in registered form and shall be transferable only upon the surrender of a Security for registration of transfer and in compliance with the Appendix. When a Security is presented to the Registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of Section 8-401(a)(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code are met. When Securities are presented to the Registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met. To permit registration of transfers and exchanges, the Issuers shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar’s request. The Issuers may require payment of a sum sufficient to pay all taxes, assessments or other governmental charges in connection with any such transfer or exchange pursuant to this Section. The Issuers shall not be required to make and the Registrar need not register transfers or exchanges of Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of Securities to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed. 

Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security, the Issuers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, and the Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name a Security is registered as the absolute owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving the payment of principal and interest, if any, on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security is overdue, and none of the Issuers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 

Any Holder of a Global Security shall, by acceptance of such Global Security, agree that transfers of beneficial interest in such Global Security may be effected only through a book-entry system maintained by (a) the Holder of such Global Security (or its agent) or (b) any Holder of a beneficial interest in such Global Security, and that ownership of a beneficial interest in such Global Security shall be required to be reflected in a book entry. 

All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange pursuant to the terms of this Indenture will evidence the same debt and will be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange. 

Section 2.09.  Replacement Securities. If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Security claims that a Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Issuers shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met, such that the Holder (a) satisfies the Issuers or the Trustee within a reasonable time after such Holder has notice of such loss, destruction or wrongful taking, and the Registrar does not register a transfer prior to receiving such notification, (b) requests the Issuers or the Trustee to issue a new replacement Security, prior to the Security being acquired by a protected purchaser as defined in Section 8-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code (a “**protected purchaser**”) and (c) satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee. If required by the Trustee or the Issuers, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee to protect the Issuers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Issuers and the Trustee may charge the Holder for the expenses they incur in replacing a Security. In the event any such mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken Security has become or is 

^^^^^ 
about to become due and payable, the Issuers in their discretion may pay such Security instead of issuing a new Security in replacement thereof. 

Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Issuers. 

The provisions of this Section 2.09 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken Securities. 

Section 2.10.  Outstanding Securities. Securities outstanding at any time consist of all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. Subject to Section 10.06, a Security does not cease to be outstanding because an Issuer or an Affiliate of an Issuer holds the Security. 

If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.09, the Security so replaced ceases to be outstanding unless and until the Trustee and the Issuers receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a protected purchaser. 

If the Paying Agent (other than the Issuers or Affiliates of the Issuers) segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date, money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, then on and after that date, such Securities (or portions thereof) shall cease to be outstanding and interest on them shall cease to accrue. 

Section 2.11.  Temporary Securities. In the event that Definitive Securities are to be issued under the terms of this Indenture, until such Definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Issuers may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of Definitive Securities but may have variations that the Issuers consider appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Issuers shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate Definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for temporary Securities upon surrender of such temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Issuers, without charge to the Holder. 

Section 2.12.  Cancellation. The Issuers at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and deliver canceled Securities to an Issuer pursuant to written direction by an Officer of such Issuer. The Issuers may not issue new Securities to replace Securities they have redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. The Trustee shall not authenticate Securities in place of canceled Securities other than pursuant to the terms of this Indenture. 

Section 2.13.  Defaulted Interest. If the Issuers default in a payment of interest on the Securities, the Issuers shall pay the defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner. The Issuers may pay the defaulted interest to the Persons who are Securityholders on a subsequent special record date. The Issuers shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed to each Securityholder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. 

^^^^^ 
^CUSIP Numbers. The Issuers in issuing the Securities may use “CUSIP” numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use “CUSIP” numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; *provided*, *however*, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. 

Section 2.15.  Issuance of Additional Securities. After the Closing Date, the Issuers shall be entitled to issue Additional Securities under this Indenture in an unlimited aggregate principal amount, which Securities shall have identical terms as the Securities issued on the Closing Date, other than with respect to the date of issuance, the issue price and the date from which interest thereon will begin to accrue. 

With respect to any Additional Securities, each Issuer shall set forth in a resolution of the Board of Directors and an Officers’ Certificate, a copy of each which shall be delivered to the Trustee, the following information: 

^^the aggregate principal amount of Securities outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Securities; 

^^the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Securities to be authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture; and 

^^the issue price, the issue date and the CUSIP number of such Additional Securities; *provided*, *however*, that no Additional Securities may be issued unless such Additional Securities would be fungible for United States Federal income tax purposes with all other Securities issued under this Indenture. 

^\centered REDEMPTION 

Section 3.01.  Notices to Trustee. If the Issuers elect to redeem Securities pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Securities, they shall notify the Trustee in writing of the redemption date and the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed. The redemption provisions of paragraph 5 of the Securities are fully incorporated herein. 

The Issuers shall give each notice to the Trustee provided for in this Section at least 45 days before the redemption date unless the Trustee consents to a shorter period. Such notice shall be accompanied by an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel from the Issuers to the effect that such redemption will comply with the conditions and covenants herein. If fewer than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the record date relating to such redemption shall be selected by the Issuers and given to the Trustee, which record date shall be not fewer than 15 days after the date of notice to the Trustee. Any such notice may be canceled at any time prior to notice of such redemption being mailed to any Holder and shall thereby be void and of no effect. 

Section 3.02.  Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed. If fewer than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Securities, not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to be 

^^^^^ 
redeemed pro rata or by lot or by a method that complies with applicable legal and securities exchange requirements, if any, and that the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate and in accordance with methods generally used at the time of selection by fiduciaries in similar circumstances. The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Securities not previously called for redemption. The Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal of Securities that have denominations larger than $[[USD Value 3: Number]] Securities and portions thereof that the Trustee selects shall be in amounts of $[[USD Value 2]] or a whole multiple of $[[USD Value 3]] Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuers of the Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed. 

Section 3.03.  Notice of Redemption. At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a date for redemption of Securities, the Issuers shall mail a notice of redemption by first-class mail to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at such Holder’s registered address. 

The notice shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:

^^the CUSIP number, if any, printed on the Securities being redeemed; and 

^^that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Securities. 

At the Issuers’ request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Issuers’ name and at the Issuers’ expense. In such event, the Issuers shall provide the Trustee with the information required by this Section. 

Section 3.04.  Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is mailed, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date and at the redemption price stated in the notice. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price stated in the notice, plus accrued interest, if any, to the redemption date; *provided*, *however*, that if the redemption date is after a regular record date and on or prior to the interest payment date, the accrued interest shall be payable to the Securityholder of the redeemed Securities registered on the relevant record 

^^^^^ 
date. Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder. 

Section 3.05.  Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to 11:00 a.m. on the redemption date, the Issuers shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if an Issuer or a Subsidiary of any of the Issuers is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on all Securities to be redeemed on that date other than Securities or portions of Securities called for redemption that have been delivered by the Issuers to the Trustee for cancellation. 

Section 3.06.  Securities Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Issuers shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder (at the Issuers’ expense) a new Security equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered. 

^\centered COVENANTS 

Section 4.01.  Payment of Securities. The Issuers shall promptly pay the principal of and interest on the Securities on the dates and in the manner provided in the Securities and in this Indenture. Principal and interest shall be considered paid on the date due if on such date the Trustee or the Paying Agent holds, in accordance with this Indenture, money sufficient to pay all principal and interest then due and the Trustee or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, is not prohibited from paying such money to the Securityholders on that date pursuant to the terms of this Indenture. 

The Issuers shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate specified in the Securities, and shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers’ Certificates). The Issuers also shall comply with the other provisions of TIA Section 314(a). 

Section 4.03.  Corporate Existence. Each Issuer shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence, material rights (charter and statutory) and material franchises (other than as contemplated by Section 5.01); *provided*, *however*, that such Issuer shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation of such rights or franchises is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries considered as a whole. 

Section 4.04.  Restrictions on Liens. Except as provided in Section 4.06, the Issuers shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or suffer to exist any Lien to secure any Indebtedness

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, unless the Issuers have exercised their right to redeem the Securities as described under paragraph 5 of the Securities, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuers to purchase all or a portion (equal to $[[USD Value 1]] or an integral multiple of $[[USD Value 2]] in excess thereof) of such Holder’s Securities, at a purchase price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment, subject to the rights of Holders of Securities on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. 

Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Issuers’ option, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the pending Change of Control, the Issuers shall mail, or cause to be mailed, by first class mail, a notice to the Trustee and to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and specifying: 

^^that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 4.07 and that all Securities tendered will be accepted for payment; 

^^the Change of Control Payment and the purchase date, which shall be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, other than as may be required by law (the “**Change of Control Payment Date**”); 

^^the CUSIP numbers for the Securities; 

^^that any Securities not tendered will continue to accrue interest; 

^^that, unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Securities accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date; 

^^that Holders electing to have any Securities purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Securities to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; 

^^that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election referred to in clause (f) if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Securities delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have the Securities purchased; 

^^^^^ 
^^that Holders whose Securities are being purchased only in part will be issued new Securities equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered, which unpurchased portion will be equal to $[[USD Value 1]] in principal amount or an integral multiple of $[[USD Value 2]] in excess thereof; and 

^^that, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. 

The Issuers shall cause the Change of Control Offer to remain open for such period as is required by applicable law. The Issuers shall comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 4.07 or paragraph 7 of the Securities, the Issuers will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this Section 4.07 or paragraph 7 of the Securities by virtue of any such conflict. 

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent lawful: 

^^accept or cause a third party to accept for payment all Securities or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; 

^^deposit or cause a third party to deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered; and 

^^deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Securities so accepted together with an Officers’ Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities or portions of Securities being purchased by the Issuers. 

The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Securities properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Securities, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered, if any; *provided* that each new Security will be in a principal amount of $[[USD Value 1]] or an integral multiple of $[[USD Value 2]] in excess thereof. The Issuers will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. 

The Issuers shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party involved in the applicable Change of Control makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 4.07 applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

^Waiver of Certain Covenants. Each of the Issuers may in any particular instance, be excused from failing to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Section 4.02 or Sections 4.04 to 4.06, with respect to the Securities if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities shall, by act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Issuers, and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect. 

The Issuers may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons entitled to waive compliance with any covenant or condition hereunder. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to waive any such compliance, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; *provided* that unless the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities affected shall have waived such compliance prior to the date which is 90 days after such record date, any such waiver previously given shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. 

Section 4.09.  Compliance Certificate. The Issuers shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuers an Officers’ Certificate stating that in the course of the performance by the signers of their duties as Officers of the Issuers they would normally have knowledge of any Default and whether or not the signers know of any Default that occurred during such period. If they do, the certificate shall describe the Default, its status and what action the Issuers are taking or propose to take with respect thereto. The Issuers also shall comply with TIA Section 314(a)(4).

The Successor Company shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the applicable Issuer under this Indenture, but the predecessor Issuer in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets shall not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Securities. 

^\centered DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES 

Section 6.01.  Events of Default. An “**Event of Default**” with respect to the Securities occurs if: 

^^the Issuers default in any payment of interest on any Security when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a period of 30 days;

^^any Issuer fails to comply with any of its covenants or agreements contained in the Securities or this Indenture (other than those referred to in (a), (b), (c) or (d) above) and such failure continues for 60 days after receipt by the Issuers of the notice specified below; 

^^any Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary defaults under any Indebtedness (other than the Securities), whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, and such default results in Indebtedness in excess of $[[USD Value 4: Number]] or its foreign currency equivalent becoming due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, without such Indebtedness having been discharged or such acceleration having been rescinded or annulled within 30 days after receipt by the Issuers of the notice specified below; 

^^^^^ 
^^any Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law: 

^commences a voluntary case;  

^consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case; 

^consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property; or 

^makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency; 

^^a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: 

^is for relief against any Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary in an involuntary case; 

^appoints a Custodian of any Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary or for any substantial part of its property; or 

^orders the winding up or liquidation of any Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days; 

^^any judgment or decree for the payment of money in excess of $[[USD Value 4]] or its foreign currency equivalent at the time, is entered against any Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary and either (1) an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree or (2) there is a period of 60 days following the entry of such judgment or decree during which such judgment or decree remains outstanding and is not discharged, waived or the execution thereof stayed; or 

^^the co-obligation of any of the Issuers under this Indenture or under any Security issued pursuant to this Indenture ceases to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms of this Indenture). 

The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. 

The term “**Bankruptcy Law**” means Title 11, United States Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term “**Custodian**” means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law. 

^Default under clause (d), (e) or (f) above is not an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least [[Percentage 7: Number]]% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities notify the applicable Issuer of 

^^^^^ 
the Default and such Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (d), (e) or (f), as applicable, after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a “**Notice of Default**.” 

The Issuers shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers’ Certificate of any Event of Default under clause (f) and any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under clause (d), (e) or (i), its status and what action the Issuers are taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. 

Section 6.02.  Acceleration. If an Event of Default with respect to any Securities at the time outstanding (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(g) or (h) with respect to any Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least [[Percentage 7]]% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities by written notice to the Issuers (and to the Trustee, if notice is given by such Holders), may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(g) or (h) with respect to any Issuer occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Securities shall *ipso facto* become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto. 

Section 6.03.  Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture. 

The Trustee may institute and maintain a suit or legal proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative. 

Section 6.04.  Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default and its consequences except a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on a Security, a Default arising from the failure to redeem or purchase any Security when required pursuant to the terms of this Indenture or a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Securityholder affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right. 

Section 6.05.  Control by Majority. With respect to Securities, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.01, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would subject the Trustee to personal liability; *provided*, *however*, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to 

^^^^^ 
taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. 

Section 6.06.  Limitation on Suits. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Security may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities unless: 

^^the Holder previously gave the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing; 

^^the Holders of at least [[Percentage 7]]% in the aggregate in principal amount of the outstanding Securities make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; 

^^such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; 

^^the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and 

^^the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period. 

^Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Securityholder. 

Section 6.07.  Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. 

Section 6.08.  Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a) or (b) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Issuers for the whole amount then due and owing (together with interest on any unpaid interest to the extent lawful) and the amounts provided for in Section 7.07. 

Section 6.09.  Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to any Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, their creditors or their property and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other Person performing similar functions, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. 

^^^^^ 
^Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money or property in the following order: 

FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07; 

SECOND: to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and 

THIRD: to the Issuers.  

The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this Section. At least 15 days before such record date, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder and each Issuer a notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount to be paid. 

Section 6.11.  Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing, by any party litigant in the suit, of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 or a suit by Holders of more than [[Percentage 8: Number]]% in principal amount of the Securities. 

Section 6.12.  Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. None of the Issuers (to the extent it may lawfully do so) shall at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and each Issuer (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

Section 7.01.  Duties of Trustee.  

^^If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person’s own affairs. 

^^Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: 

^the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and 

^^^^^ 
^in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).

^^Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from funds except to the extent required by law.

^^Every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and to the provisions of the TIA. 

Section 7.02.  Rights of Trustee.  

^^The Trustee may conclusively rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document. 

^^Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers’ Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officers’ Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. 

^^The Trustee may act through agents or attorneys and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent or attorney appointed with due care. 

^^^^^ 
^^The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; *provided*, *however*, that the Trustee’s conduct does not constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence.

^^The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, debenture, note or other paper or document. 

^^The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture. 

^^The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and to each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder. 

Section 7.03.  Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee, or any of its Affiliates, in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Issuers or their Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-paying agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11. 

Section 7.04.  Trustee’s Disclaimer. The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Issuers’ use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for any statement in this Indenture, in the Securities, or in any document executed in connection with the sale of the Securities, other than those set forth in the Trustee’s certificate of authentication. 

Section 7.05.  Notice of Defaults. If a Default with respect to the Securities occurs and is continuing and if it is actually known to a Trust Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any Security (including payments pursuant to the mandatory redemption provisions of such Security, if any), the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Securityholders. 

Section 7.06.  Reports by Trustee to Holder. As promptly as practicable after each [[Date 2: Date]] beginning with the [[Date 2]] following the Closing Date, and in any event prior to [[Date 3: Date]] in each year, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder a brief report dated as of such [[Date 2]] that complies with Section 13(a) of the TIA. The Trustee shall also comply with Section 313(b) of the TIA. 

^^^^^ 
^copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange (if any) on which the Securities are listed. The Issuers agree to notify promptly and in writing the Trustee whenever the Securities become listed on any stock exchange and of any delisting thereof. 

Section 7.07.  Compensation and Indemnity. Each of the Issuers, jointly and severally, shall pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation for its services as the Issuers and the Trustee shall from time to time agree in writing. The Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Issuers, jointly and severally, shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by such Trustee, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee’s agents, counsel, accountants and experts.

The Trustee shall notify the Issuers of any claim for which it may seek indemnity promptly upon obtaining actual knowledge thereof, *provided*, *however*, that any failure so to notify the Issuers shall not relieve any Issuer of its indemnity obligations hereunder. The Issuers need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by an indemnified party through such party’s own willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith. 

To secure the Issuers’ payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay the principal of and interest on particular Securities. 

The Issuers’ payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the satisfaction or discharge of this Indenture, any rejection or termination of this Indenture under any bankruptcy law or the resignation or removal of the Trustee. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(g) or (h) with respect to any Issuer, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Law. 

Section 7.08.  Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities by so notifying the Issuers. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may remove the Trustee with respect to the Securities and may appoint a successor Trustee. The Issuers shall remove the Trustee if: 

^^the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10; 

^^the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; 

^^a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee property; or 

^^the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. 

If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Issuers or by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities and such Holders do not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such 

^^^^^ 
event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Issuers shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities. 

^successor Trustee with respect to the Securities shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Issuers. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Securityholders at their last known addresses as they appear on the Registrar’s books. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07. 

If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of [[Percentage 8]]% in principal amount of the Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities. 

If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Securityholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities. 

Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Issuers’ obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.

^^to conform the text of this Indenture or the Securities to any provision of the “Description of the Notes” in the Prospectus to the extent that such provision in the “Description of the Notes” in the Prospectus is intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of this Indenture or the Securities. 

After an amendment under this Section becomes effective, the Issuers shall mail to Securityholders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Securityholders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section. 

^^^^^ 
^With Consent of Holders. The Issuers and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities without notice to any Securityholder but with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for the Securities).

Alternatively, if the Issuers or the Trustee so determines, the Issuers in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment. 

Section 9.06.  Trustee to Sign Amendments. The Trustee shall sign any amendment authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may but need not sign it.

then the Trustee shall cancel such Definitive Security and cause, or direct the Securities Custodian to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depositary and the Securities Custodian, the aggregate principal amount of Securities represented by the Global Security to be increased by the aggregate principal amount of the Definitive Security to be exchanged and shall credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Security equal to the principal amount of the Definitive Security so canceled. If no Global Securities are then outstanding and the Global Security has not been previously exchanged for certificated securities pursuant to Section 2.4, the Issuers shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon written order of the Issuers in the form of an Officers’ Certificate, a new Global Security in the appropriate principal amount. 

^^Transfer and Exchange of Global Securities. 

^The transfer and exchange of Global Securities or beneficial interests therein shall be effected through the Depositary, in accordance with this Indenture (including applicable restrictions on transfer set forth herein, if any) and the procedures of the Depositary therefor.

^If the proposed transfer is a transfer of a beneficial interest in one Global Security to a beneficial interest in another Global Security, the Securities Custodian shall reflect on its books and records the date and an increase in the principal amount of the Global Security to which such interest is being transferred in an amount equal to the principal amount of the interest to be so transferred, and the Securities Custodian shall reflect on its books and records the date and a corresponding decrease in the principal amount of the Global Security from which such interest is being transferred.

^In the event that a Global Security is exchanged for Definitive Securities pursuant to Section 2.4, such Securities may be exchanged only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.3 and such other procedures as may from time to time be adopted by the Issuers.

The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the “**TIA**”). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all terms and provisions of the Indenture, and Securityholders are referred to the Indenture, and the TIA for a statement of such terms and provisions. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Security and the terms of the Indenture, the Indenture shall govern.

The Securities will be redeemable as a whole or in part, at the option of the Issuers at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) [[Percentage 3]]% of their principal amount or (b) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) discounted to the date of redemption, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the Treasury Rate (as defined below) and 50 basis points. 

In the case of each of clauses (a) and (b), accrued interest will be payable to the redemption date. 

“**Comparable Treasury Issue**” means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term (“**remaining life**”) of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities. 

“**Comparable Treasury Price**” means, with respect to any redemption date, (a) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (b) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. 

“**Independent Investment Banker**” means either Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as specified by the Issuers, or, if neither of the foregoing is willing or able to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Issuers.

Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors and, at the Issuers’ option, three other nationally recognized investment banking firms that are primary dealers of U.S. Government securities in New York City (each, a “**Primary Treasury Dealer**”). If any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Issuers shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer. 

“**Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations**” means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date. 

“**Remaining Scheduled Payments**” means, with respect to any Security to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on such Security that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption.

“**Treasury Rate**” means, with respect to any redemption date, (a) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently 

\centered Ex. A-6 

^^^^^

^Sinking Fund. The Securities are not subject to any sinking fund. 

^Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Securities, unless the Issuers have exercised their right to redeem the Securities as described under paragraph 5, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuers to purchase all or a portion (equal to $[[USD Value 1]] or an integral multiple of $[[USD Value 2]] in excess thereof) of such Holder’s Securities pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, at a purchase price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment, subject to the rights of Holders of Securities on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. 

^Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at his or her registered address. Securities in denominations larger than $[[USD Value 1]] may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $[[USD Value 3]] If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued and unpaid interest on all Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such date, interest ceases to accrue on such Securities (or such portions thereof) called for redemption. 

^Denominations, Transfer, Exchange. The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $[[USD Value 1]] and integral multiples of $[[USD Value 2]] in excess thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or transfer or exchange any Securities for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of Securities to be redeemed. 

^Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 

^Unclaimed Money. If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Issuers upon their written request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Issuers and not to the Trustee for payment. 

\centered Ex. A-7 

^^^^^ 
^Discharge and Defeasance. Subject to certain conditions, the Issuers at any time may terminate some of or all their obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Issuers deposit with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be. 

^Amendment, Waiver. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (a) the Indenture or the Securities may be amended without prior notice to any Securityholder but with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities and (b) any default or noncompliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder of Securities, the Issuers and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Securities (i) to evidence the succession of another person to an Issuer and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Issuers in the Indenture and in the Securities, (ii) to add to the covenants of the Issuers or a Subsidiary for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power in the Indenture conferred upon the Issuers or any Subsidiary, (iii) to add to or change any of the provisions of the Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities in bearer form, registrable or not registrable as to principal, and with or without interest coupons, or to permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities in uncertificated form; *provided* that any uncertificated Securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Securities are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, (iv) to issue Additional Securities in accordance with the Indenture, (v) to secure the Securities or add any guarantee with respect to the Securities, (vi) to provide for the appointment of a successor trustee; *provided* that the successor trustee is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of the Indenture, (vii) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision in the Indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision in the Indenture, or to make any other change that does not adversely affect the Holders of the Securities, (viii) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, (ix) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Securities; *provided, however,* that (a) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (b) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Securities and (x) to conform the text of the Indenture or the Securities to any provision of the “Description of the Notes” in the Prospectus to the extent that such provision in the “Description of the Notes” in the Prospectus is intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture or the Securities. 

^Defaults and Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of any Issuer) and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least [[Percentage 7]]% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of any Issuer occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Securities shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Securities and its consequences. 

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or 

\centered Ex. A-8 

^^^^^ 
interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Securities unless (a) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing, (b) Holders of at least [[Percentage 7]]% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities have requested in writing that the Trustee pursue the remedy, (c) such Holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense, (d) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity and (e) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would subject the Trustee to personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. 

^Trustee Dealings with the Issuers. Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Issuers or their Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Issuers or their Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 

^No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of any Issuer shall not have any liability for any obligations of such Issuer under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.

^Governing Law. THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY. 

^CUSIP Numbers. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuers have caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities and have directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Securityholders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
