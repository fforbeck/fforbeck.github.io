^^^the Company will instruct any transfer agent not to register any transfer of the Securities or the Conversion Shares (or any portion thereof) until the applicable time set forth in clause (iii) above unless the conditions specified in the foregoing legends are satisfied or, if the opinion of counsel referred to above is to the further effect that such legend is not required in order to establish compliance with any provisions of the Securities Act or this Agreement, or other satisfactory assurances of such nature are given to the Company. 

The Company acknowledges and agrees that an Investor may from time to time pledge, and/or grant a security interest in some or all of the Securities or the Conversion Shares pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement in connection with a bona fide margin account with a financial institution that is an “accredited investor,” as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act, and, if required under the terms of such agreement or account, the Investor may transfer pledged or secured Securities or Conversion Shares to the pledgees or secured parties. Such a pledge or transfer shall not be subject to approval or consent of the Company and no legal opinion of legal counsel to the pledgee, secured party or pledgor shall be required in connection with the pledge, but such legal opinion may be required in connection with a subsequent transfer following default by the Investor transferee of the pledge. No notice shall be required of such pledge. At the applicable Investor’s expense, the Company will execute and deliver such reasonable documentation as a pledgee or secured party of Securities or Conversion Shares may reasonably request in connection with a pledge or transfer of the Securities or Conversion Shares including the preparation and filing of any required prospectus supplement under Rule 424(b)(3) of the Securities Act or other applicable provision of the Securities Act to appropriately amend the list of Selling Stockholders thereunder.

Following such time as restrictive notations are not required to be made relative to any Book Entry evidencing, or legends are not required to be placed on certificates representing, Exchange Shares or Conversion Shares, the Company will (A) promptly upon a request by an Investor, instruct the transfer agent for the Company to remove the restrictive notation from Book Entries evidencing such Exchange Shares or Conversion Shares; and (B) no later than three Trading Days following the delivery by an Investor to the Company or the Company’s transfer agent of a certificate representing Exchange Shares or Conversion Shares containing a restrictive legend, deliver or cause to be delivered to such Investor a certificate representing such Exchange Shares or Conversion Shares that is free from all restrictive and other legends. 

The Company shall cause its counsel to issue a legal opinion to the Company’s transfer agent promptly after the effective date of a registration statement covering the Exchange Shares or Conversion

Shares if required by the Company’s transfer agent to effect the removal of any notation on the Book Entries evidencing, or legend on the certificates representing, such Exchange Shares or Conversion Shares. The Company may not make any notation on its records or give instructions to any transfer agent of the Company that enlarge the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section. Certificates for Exchange Shares or Conversion Shares subject to legend removal hereunder shall be transmitted by the transfer agent of the Company to the Investors by crediting the account of the Investor’s prime broker with the Depository Trust Company system. 

Each Investor, severally and not jointly with the other Investors, agrees that the removal of the restrictive notation on the Book Entries evidencing, or legend from certificates representing, Exchange Shares or Conversion Shares, as set forth in this Section 3.2(b), is predicated upon the Company’s reliance that the Investor will sell any Exchange Shares or Conversion Shares pursuant to either the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including any applicable prospectus delivery requirements, or an exemption therefrom. 

^^Financial Sophistication. The Investor has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. 

^^Accredited Investor Status. The Investor is an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act. 

^^Residency. The Investor is organized under the laws of the state set forth beneath such Investor’s name on the signature page attached hereto, and its principal place of operations is in the state set forth beneath such Investor’s name on the signature page attached hereto. 

^^No Investment, Tax or Legal Advice. Each Investor understands that nothing in the Company SEC Documents, this Agreement, or any other materials presented to the Investor in connection with the issuance of the Securities constitutes legal, tax or investment advice. Each Investor has consulted such legal, tax and investment advisors as it, in its sole discretion, has deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with its purchase of Securities. 

^^Additional Acknowledgement. Each Investor acknowledges that it has independently evaluated the merits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that it has independently determined to enter into the transactions contemplated hereby, that it is not relying on any advice from or evaluation by any other person. Each Investor acknowledges that it has not taken any actions that would deem the Investors to be members of a “group” for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.

Each Investor’s obligation to exchange 2008 Notes for the Securities at the Closing is subject to the fulfillment to that Investor’s reasonable satisfaction, on or prior to the Closing, of all of the following conditions, any of which may be waived by such Investor:

No stop order or other order enjoining the exchange of the 2008 Notes or the issuance of the Securities or Conversion Shares shall have been issued and no proceedings for such purpose shall be pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the SEC, or any commissioner of corporations or similar officer of any state having jurisdiction over this transaction.

^^Opinion. The Company shall have delivered to Investors the opinion of Andrews Kurth, LLP, counsel to the Company, dated as of the Closing Date in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D. 

^^Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The Company’s obligation to exchange the 2008 Notes and issue the Securities at the Closing is subject to the fulfillment to the Company’s reasonable satisfaction, on or prior to the Closing of the following conditions, any of which may be waived by the Company:

\centered Page 11

^^Qualifications, Legal Investment. All authorizations, approvals, or permits, if any, of any governmental authority or regulatory body of the United States or of any state that are required in connection with the lawful exchange of the 2008 Notes and issuance of the Securities and Conversion Shares shall have been duly obtained and shall be effective on and as of the Closing. No stop order or other order enjoining the conversion of the Notes or the issuance of the Securities or Conversion Shares shall have been issued and no proceedings for such purpose shall be pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the SEC, or any commissioner of corporations or similar officer of any state having jurisdiction over this transaction. At the time of the Closing, conversion of the Notes and issuance of the Securities and the Conversion Shares shall be legally permitted by all laws and regulations to which the Investors and the Company are subject. No litigation, statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling or injunction shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or endorsed by or in any court or governmental authority of competent jurisdiction or any self-regulatory organization having authority over the matters contemplated hereby which prohibits the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. 

^^Execution of Agreements. The Investors shall have executed this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and delivered this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement to the Company. 

^Additional Covenants. 

^^Reporting Status. With a view to making available to the Investors the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which may permit the sale of the Securities and Conversion Shares to the public without registration, the Company agrees to use its best efforts to file with the SEC, in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Exchange Act. The Company will otherwise take such further action as an Investor may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Investor to sell the Securities and Conversion Shares without registration under the Securities Act or any successor rule or regulation adopted by the SEC. 

^^Listing. So long as an Investor owns any of the Securities or Conversion Shares, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the automated quotation of its Common Stock, including the Exchange Shares and Conversion Shares, on the Principal Market or an alternative listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market or, if such quotation on the Principal Market or the NASDAQ Stock Market is not possible, qualification for trading on the OTCBB, and will comply in all material respects with the Company’s reporting, filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. and such exchange or listing, if applicable. 

^^Non-Public Information. The Company covenants and agrees that neither it nor any other person acting on its behalf will provide any Investor or its agents or counsel with any information that the Company believes constitutes material non-public information, unless prior thereto such Investor shall have executed a written agreement regarding the confidentiality and use of such information. The Company understands and confirms that each Investor shall be relying on the foregoing representations in effecting transactions in securities of the Company. 

\centered Page 12 

^Additional Securities Law Matters. 

^^Limits on Additional Issuances. The Company will not, for a period of six months following the Closing Date, offer for sale or sell any securities unless, in the opinion of the Company’s counsel, such offer or sale does not jeopardize the availability of exemptions from the registration and qualification requirements under applicable securities laws with respect to the securities being offered hereby. Except for the issuance of common stock under the Amended Credit Agreement**,** stock options under the Company’s stock option plans, the issuance of common stock upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities, the issuance of common stock purchase warrants, and the offering contemplated hereby, the Company has not engaged in any offering of equity securities during the six months prior to the date of this Agreement. The foregoing provisions shall not prevent the Company from filing a “shelf” registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, but the foregoing provisions shall apply to any sale of securities thereunder. 

^^Form D and State Securities Filings. If applicable, the Company will file with the SEC a Notice of Sale of Securities on Form D with respect to the Securities, as required under Regulation D under the Securities Act, no later than 15 days after the Closing Date. The Company will promptly and timely file all documents and pay all filing fees required by any states’ securities laws in connection with the issuance of Securities. 

^^Supplying Information. For so long as the Securities remain outstanding and are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, the Company will furnish to holders of the Securities and prospective purchasers of the Securities designated by such holders, upon the request of such holders or such prospective purchasers, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act, unless the Company is then subject to and in compliance with Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 

^Miscellaneous. 

^^Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the choice of law provisions thereof, and the federal laws of the United States. 

^^Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, assigns, heirs, executors, and administrators of the parties hereto.

Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other than the parties thereto and their respective successors and assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided therein.
