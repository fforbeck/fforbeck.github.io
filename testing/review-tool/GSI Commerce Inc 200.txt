^Application of Plan; Administration    This Agreement and your rights under this Agreement are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan, as it may be amended from time to time, as well as to such 

rules and regulations as the Board (or an appropriate committee thereof) may adopt. It is expressly understood that the Board (or an appropriate committee thereof) that administers the Plan is authorized to administer, construe and make all determinations necessary or appropriate to the administration of the Plan and this Agreement, all of which shall be binding upon you to the extent permitted by the Plan.

^Performance Goal    (a) The number of PRSUs to be awarded to you under this Agreement shall depend upon the extent to which the Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow (as defined in Section 2(b) equals, exceeds or falls short of $ for the Performance Period. If actual Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow for the Performance Period does not equal or exceed the [[Percentage 2: Number]]% Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow Target threshold, as set forth in the table below, the right to receive an award of any PRSUs pursuant to this Agreement shall expire without consideration. 

^^**Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow** means Non-GAAP Income from Operations minus capital expenditures paid by the Company for fiscal . **Non-GAAP Income from Operations** means the Company’s consolidated income from operations excluding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses, and the following expenses relating to acquisitions: transaction expenses, due diligence expenses, integration expenses, non-cash inventory valuation adjustments, and the cash portion of any deferred acquisition payments recorded as compensation expense, after taking into affect any payment of incentives under this Plan for fiscal . Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow will exclude any one time significant gains or losses on assets or equity sales or any other extraordinary, non-operating revenue or expense. The Board (or an appropriate committee thereof) has the discretion to determine what constitutes an extraordinary event and the impact to the Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow Targets.

^^Subject to the foregoing, and provided that you have remained in Continuous Service with the Company from the Grant Date set forth above, the number of PRSUs to be awarded to you following completion of the Performance Period (such PRSUs, the “Awarded PRSUs”) shall be determined in accordance with the following schedules:

***Non-GAAP Free*** ***Cash Flow*** ***Required to*** ***Percentage***    ***Achieve*** ***Non-GAAP***    ***Percentage* *Non-***      ***Number of Awarded*** ***Free Cash***    ***GAAP Free Cash***    ***PRSUs If Percentage Non-GAAP Free Cash*** ***Flow***    ***Flow Target***    ***Flow Goal Achieved*** [[Percentage 2]]% Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow Target    $    0.20 times Target Number of PRSUs [[Percentage 3: Number]]% Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow Target    $    0.467 times Target Number of PRSUs [[Percentage 4: Number]]% Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow Target    $    0.733 times Target Number of PRSUs [[Percentage 5: Number]]% Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow Target    $    1 times Target Number of PRSUs [[Percentage 6: Number]]% Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow Target    $    1.25 times Target Number of PRSUs [[Percentage 7: Number]]% Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow Target    $    1.5 times Target Number of PRSUs  

\centered 

In the event that the Company’s Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow for the Performance Period falls between two of the Percentage Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow Targets listed in the table above, the number of Awarded PRSUs shall be determined by linear interpolation.  

^^^^^ 
\centered 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall more than 1.5 times the Target Number of PRSUs be awarded under this Agreement.  Following the end of the Performance Period and the collection of relevant data necessary to determine the extent to which the Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow Target set forth in this Section 2 has been satisfied, the Board (or an appropriate committee thereof) will determine: (a) the Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow achieved by the Company for the Performance Period, and (b) the multiple of the Target Number of PRSUs to be awarded as Awarded PRSUs. The Board (or an appropriate committee thereof) shall make these determinations in its sole discretion. The class and number of securities to be issued under this Agreement shall be subject to adjustment as provided for in Section 12(a) of the Plan. The Board’s (or an appropriate committee thereof) determination pursuant to this paragraph shall be evidenced by a written certification. 

^Vesting    [[Percentage 5]]% of the Awarded PRSUs will vest (becoming “Vested Performance Units”) on  (the “Vesting Date”), provided that you have remained in Continuous Service with the Company from the Grant Date set forth above until the Vesting Date, and provided further that in no case shall any Awarded PRSUs vest before the date of the Board’s (or an appropriate committee thereof) written certification pursuant to Section 2 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms and provisions of any employment agreement or offer letter between you and the Company (your “Offer Letter”), may provide that any vesting restrictions contained in this Section 3 will earlier lapse in certain circumstances. 

^Termination of Continuous Service    Except as otherwise provided in your Offer Letter and Section 7 of this Agreement, your right to any award of PRSUs and your rights under any Awarded PRSUs that have not become Vested Performance Units will be forfeited without consideration as of the date of termination of your Continuous Service with the Company for any reason.  

^^^^^ 

^Settlement of Vested Performance Units and Issuance of Shares    Each Vested Performance Unit will be settled by the delivery of one share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment under Section 12(a) of the Plan, a “Share”) to you or, in the event of your death, to your designated beneficiary, within 5 days following the Vesting Date, but in no event later than 2 / months following the last day of the Company’s fiscal year in which the Vesting Date occurs, subject to your satisfaction of any tax withholding obligations as described in Section 9 of this Agreement. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Plan, the Company will not be obligated to issue or deliver any Shares pursuant to this Agreement (i) until all conditions to this Agreement have been satisfied or removed, (ii) until, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, all applicable federal and state laws and regulations have been complied with, (iii) if the outstanding Common Stock is at the time listed on any stock exchange or included for quotation on an inter-dealer system, until the Shares have been listed or included or authorized to be listed or included on such exchange or system upon official notice of issuance, (iv) until the issuance or delivery of the Shares would not cause the Company to issue or sell more shares of Common Stock than the Company is then legally entitled to issue or sell, and (v) until all other legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of such Shares have been approved by counsel to the Company. 

You hereby authorize any brokerage service provider determined acceptable to the Company to open a securities account for you to be used for the settlement of Vested Performance Units. The date on which Shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Company such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 

^Rights as Stockholder    Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not be entitled to any privileges of ownership of the shares of Common Stock underlying your PRSUs, including voting, receipt of dividends or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company, unless and until shares of Common Stock are actually delivered to you under this Agreement. 

^Change in Control    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Awarded PRSUs shall be subject to such acceleration of vesting upon a Change in Control as may be provided for in your Offer Letter or in the Change in Control Agreement between you and the Company, if any (the “Change in Control Agreement”). 

^Transferability    Except as provided in Section 10(k) hereof, your right to receive PRSUs under this Agreement, your Awarded PRSUs and any Vested Performance Units that you hold pursuant to this Agreement are not transferable, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any voluntary or involuntary assignment, pledge, transfer, or other disposition of, or any attachment, execution, garnishment, or lien issued against or placed upon your right to receive PRSUs under this Agreement, your Awarded PRSUs and any Vested Performance Units that you hold pursuant to this Agreement in violation of the terms of this Agreement shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, you may designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Shares pursuant to this Agreement.

^Taxes    (a) *General.* You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your PRSUs, regardless of any action the Company takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 9 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the PRSUs. The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, award, vesting or settlement of the PRSUs, the Awarded PRSUs or the Vested Performance Units, and the subsequent sale of any of the Shares issued in respect of any Awarded PRSUs that may vest. Except as otherwise provided in your Offer Letter or Change in Control Agreement, the Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure this Agreement to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 

^^*Withholding.* On or before any Vesting Date, the date your Vested Performance Units are settled and Shares are issued to you pursuant to the terms of Section 5, and any other date upon which tax withholding obligations of the Company may arise, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, you hereby authorize withholding from, at the Company’s election, the Shares, payroll and any other amounts payable to you and you otherwise agree to make adequate provision for, as determined by the Company, any sums required to satisfy the Federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Company or an Affiliate, if any, which arise in connection with any of the above events or otherwise. **Unless the tax withholding obligations of the Company or any Affiliate are satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to issue a certificate for Shares.** 

^Miscellaneous    (a) YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE VESTING OF ANY AWARDED PRSUS PURSUANT TO SECTION 3 HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY YOUR CONTINUOUS SERVICE WITH THE COMPANY (AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED OR ACQUIRING GRANTED PRSUS HEREUNDER). YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS AN EMPLOYEE, DIRECTOR, OR CONSULTANT OF THE COMPANY FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE WITH YOUR RIGHT OR THE COMPANY’S RIGHT TO TERMINATE YOUR RELATIONSHIP (I) AS AN EMPLOYEE AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE; (II) AS A CONSULTANT PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY OR AN AFFILIATE; OR (III) AS A DIRECTOR PURSUANT TO THE BYLAWS OF THE COMPANY AND ANY APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE CORPORATE LAW OF THE STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS DOMICILED, AS THE CASE MAY BE. 

^^Your PRSUs are unfunded and as a holder of Vested Performance Units you will be considered an unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Company’s obligation, if any, to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement. Upon such issuance, you will obtain full voting and other rights as a stockholder of the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, will create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between you and the Company or any other person.

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, the Board (or an appropriate committee thereof) may, without your consent, amend this Agreement to comply with all of the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any corresponding guidance and regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is determined, in the sole discretion of the Board (or an appropriate committee thereof), that such amendment is necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

Such decision by the Board (or an appropriate committee thereof) shall be final and binding. 

^^This Agreement, the Plan, the Offer Letter, the Employee Agreement (if any) and the Change in Control Agreement represent the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the PRSUs. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Offer Letter, the terms and conditions of the Offer Letter shall prevail. 

^^If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity will not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any Section of this Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be unlawful or invalid will, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or part of such Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.
