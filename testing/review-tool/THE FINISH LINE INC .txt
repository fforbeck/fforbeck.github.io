^Participation. Any person who is an Eligible Employee as of any Offering Date under this Plan may become a Participant in this Plan beginning on such Offering Date by completing and delivering to the Committee such enrollment form(s) as the Committee shall require to authorize payroll deductions and to request participation in this Plan, all within the time period prior to such Offering Date prescribed by the Committee. 

^Payroll Deductions. 

^^Payroll deductions for a Participant shall commence on the first Payday after the Offering Date when the Eligible Employee becomes a Participant and shall continue thereafter until the earlier of (i) the termination of this Plan, as provided in Section 8.02, or (ii) the date the Participant suspends his or her payroll deductions pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 3.02.

^^A Participant may increase, decrease or suspend his or her payroll deduction one time only between Offering Dates during participation effective as of the Payday following delivery of written notice to the Committee, or as soon as administratively reasonable thereafter. A Participant’s suspension of payroll deductions shall not automatically result in withdrawal from participation in the Plan. If a Participant, on any scheduled Payday, shall receive no pay or his or her net pay shall be insufficient, after all required deductions, to permit withholding the payroll deduction in full as authorized hereunder and in the enrollment form, the Corporation or its subsidiary shall (i) if the pay is insufficient for any deduction hereunder, suspend the deduction until the next Payday in which Participant’s net pay is sufficient for such withholding, or (ii) if the pay is insufficient for a full deduction hereunder, effect a partial deduction equal to the net pay available for such deduction; provided, however, that no withdrawal shall be deemed to have occurred in either event.

^Participant’s Account. On each Payday, the Corporation or its subsidiary, as the case may be, shall deduct the authorized amount from each Participant’s Plan Compensation and, as soon as administratively reasonable, shall report the amount of such deductions to the Custodian. The Custodian shall credit the Account of each Participant with the amount of the Participant’s payroll deduction under the Plan effective as of the Payday on which it was deducted. Interest may be earned and retained by the Corporation but interest shall not be paid on amounts held in a Participant’s Account.

The shares subject to issuance under this Plan shall be Common Stock. The total number of shares of Common Stock which may be purchased under this Plan shall not exceed in the aggregate one million two hundred thousand (1,200,000) shares, of which not more than one hundred twenty thousand (120,000) shares of Common Stock shall be issued in any one calendar year during the Plan Term, except as such numbers of shares of Common Stock shall be or have been adjusted in accordance with Sections 5.01(a) and 8.01 of this Plan. In the event the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable for any calendar year shall exceed one hundred twenty thousand (120,000) shares of Common Stock (adjusted pursuant to Sections 5.01(a) and 8.01 of the Plan) (the “Annual Maximum”), the Committee shall reduce proportionately each Participant’s purchase hereunder to the extent necessary so that the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock will not exceed the Annual Maximum (allocated proportionately for each Purchase Date during each calendar) and if any such reduction results in cash credited to a Participant’s Account, such cash credited shall remain credited to the Participant’s Account and be used to purchase Common Stock on the next Purchase Date. Common Stock required to satisfy purchases pursuant to the Plan shall be provided out of the Corporation’s authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares or acquired by the Corporation in open market transactions or private transactions.

^^The Corporation shall offer an aggregate of one hundred twenty thousand (120,000) shares of Common Stock for purchase by Participants during each calendar year pursuant to the terms of this Plan; provided, however, for calendar year 2004 the Corporation shall offer an aggregate of forty thousand (40,000) shares of Common Stock for purchase by Participants. The number of shares of Common Stock offered annually hereunder shall be increased by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock, if any, which were offered but not purchased during prior calendar years and shall be subject to further adjustment in accordance with Section 8.01 of this Plan. 

^^Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary: 

^a Participant may not purchase Common Stock hereunder to the extent that, after such purchase, the Participant would own (or be considered to own) of record or beneficially shares in the Corporation possessing five percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Corporation, within the meaning of Code Section 423(b)(3); and (2) no Participant may purchase, during any one calendar year, shares under all employee stock purchase plans of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to accrue at a rate which exceeds Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]) of Fair Market Value of shares of Common Stock (determined at the Offering Date), within the meaning of Code Section 423(b)(8). 

^Purchase Price. The “Purchase Price” for Common Stock purchased shall be equal to [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock on the Purchase Date. 

^Purchase of Common Stock; Limitations. 

^^Within ten (10) days following each Purchase Date during the Plan Term, the Committee shall determine the Purchase Price per share of Common Stock in accordance with Section 5.02 herein. Each Participant shall thereupon automatically purchase from the Corporation and the Corporation, upon payment of the purchase price by the Custodian, shall cause to be issued to the Participant, as promptly as administratively possible, that number of shares (including fractional shares unless otherwise determined by the Committee) of Common Stock which such Participant’s Account shall enable such Participant to purchase at the Purchase Price. Irrespective of the actual date of purchase, the date of purchase of Common Stock hereunder shall be deemed the Purchase Date. All shares purchased shall be maintained by the Custodian in the Account for each Participant. All cash dividends paid with respect to shares of the Common Stock held in the Account shall be added to the Participant’s Account and shall be used to purchase shares of Common Stock at the next Purchase Date. Expenses incurred in the purchase of such shares shall be paid by the Corporation. All dividends distributed in-kind with respect to Common Stock held in the Account shall be added to the shares held for a Participant in his or her Account. Any distribution of shares with respect to shares of Common Stock held for a Participant in his or her Account shall be added to the shares of Common Stock held for a Participant in his or her Account. 

^^No Eligible Employee may purchase annually more than [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of Common Stock, or Common Stock having a Fair Market Value in excess of Ten Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]), whichever is less. 

^^A Participant shall have no interest in, or rights as a shareholder with respect to, Common Stock subject to purchase under this Plan until such shares of Common Stock have been issued to the Participant. 

^Sale of Common Stock. Unless otherwise prohibited by law or policy of the Corporation, a Participant shall have the right at any time to direct that any shares of Common Stock in his or her Account be sold and that the proceeds, less expenses of sale, be remitted to him or her. 

\centered **WITHDRAWAL** 

^Voluntary Withdrawal. A Participant may withdraw from participation in the Plan at any time. A Participant’s withdrawal shall be effective as of the Payday following delivery of written notice to the Committee, or as soon as administratively reasonable thereafter. The Committee shall notify the Custodian of the withdrawal of any Participant. As soon as administratively reasonable after the effective date of a Participant’s withdrawal from the Plan, the cash balance of the Participant’s Account shall be paid to him or her in cash. No partial withdrawals of each are permitted. When there is a voluntary withdrawal of a Participant, the Participant may elect to have his or her shares sold by the Custodian and the proceeds, after selling expenses, remitted to him or her or the Participant may elect to have the shares of Common Stock credited to his or her Account or a certificate (if the Company Stock is certificated) for the shares of Common Stock credited to the Participant’s Account forwarded to him or her or a third party directed by him or her. Any Eligible Employee who withdraws from the Plan shall be entitled to resume payroll deductions and become a Participant only after compliance with Section 3.01. 

^Involuntary Withdrawal. Upon termination of a Participant’s employment with the Corporation or its subsidiaries for any reason, or no reason, including resignation, discharge (with or without cause), disability or retirement, the cash balance of the Participant’s Account shall be paid to the Participant, or, in the case of the Participant’s death, to the Participant’s beneficiary as provided in Section 6.04. The Corporation or the Custodian shall pay such amount as soon as administratively reasonable after the Committee has received notification of such termination of employment. When there is an involuntary withdrawal of a Participant, the number of shares of Common Stock credited to his or her Account shall be forwarded to him or her or in the case of the Participant’s death to the Participant’s beneficiary as provided in Section 6.04, in a form determined by the Committee. 

^Interest. No payroll deductions or Account balances paid to a Participant, or paid to any beneficiary in accordance with Section 6.04, shall be credited with interest. 

^Participant’s Beneficiary. 

^^A Participant may file with the Committee a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any Common Stock or cash credited to the Participant’s Account under this Plan in the event of the Participant’s death. Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the Participant at any time by written notice to the Committee on the form approved by the Committee. 

^^Upon the death of a Participant, and on receipt by the Committee of reasonable proof of the identity and existence of the Participant’s designated beneficiary, the Committee shall cause delivery of the shares or cash as provided in Section 6.04(a), if any, to such beneficiary as soon as administratively reasonable. If a Participant dies without a surviving designated beneficiary, the Committee shall cause delivery of such shares or cash to the estate or a representative of the estate of the Participant. 

^^No designated beneficiary and no heir or beneficiary of the estate of a deceased Participant shall acquire any interest in the Common Stock or cash credited to the Participant’s Account under this Plan prior to the death of the Participant.

Any such attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Committee, in its sole discretion, may treat such act as an election to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section 6.01. 

^Separate Accounting for Payroll Deductions. All funds received or held by the Corporation under this Plan may be used for the Corporation’s general corporate purposes, and the Corporation shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions.
