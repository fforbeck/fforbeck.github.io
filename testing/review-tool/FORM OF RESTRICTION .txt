\centered SECTION 1 

\centered **LOCK-UP; EXCEPTIONS** 

^^**Lock-Up.** Stockholder agrees that, without the prior written consent of Parent, during the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing for twelve months after the Effective Time (the “**Lock-Up Period**”), Stockholder will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of any shares of Parent Stock acquired by Stockholder in the Merger, or any options or warrants to purchase any such shares of Parent Stock, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive shares of such Parent Stock, whether now owned or hereinafter acquired pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (a “**Disposition**”), owned directly by Stockholder (including holding as a custodian) or with respect to which Stockholder has beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. (collectively, the “**Stockholder’s Shares**”). The restrictions during the Lock-Up Period are expressly agreed to preclude Stockholder from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is 

designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of the Stockholder’s Shares even if such Stockholder’s Shares would be disposed of by someone other than Stockholder. Such prohibited hedging or other transactions would include without limitation any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including without limitation any put or call option) with respect to any of the Stockholder’s Shares or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from such shares. 

^^**Exceptions to Lock-Up.** Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in Section 1.1 above, Stockholder may (i) transfer the Stockholder’s Shares as a *bona fide* gift or gifts, provided that the donee or donees thereof agree to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, (ii) transfer the Stockholder’s Shares to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of Stockholder or the immediate family of Stockholder, provided that the trustee of the trust agrees to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, and provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value, (iii) transfer the Stockholder’s Shares by will or intestacy, provided that the transferee or transferees thereof agree to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, (iv) transfer the Stockholder’s Shares to Parent in connection with any repurchase of such Stockholder’s Shares by Parent, (v) transfer the Stockholder’s Shares pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, provided that the transferee or transferees thereof agree to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, (vi) transfer the Stockholder’s Shares in connection with a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, stock purchase, asset acquisition or other similar transaction which results in all Parent stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Parent Stock for cash, securities or other property, (vii) transfer the Stockholder’s Shares in a private transaction not over any securities exchange, provided that the transferee or transferees thereof agree to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, and provided Stockholder delivers to Parent a written notice at least ten (10) days prior to such transfer in accordance with Section 3.4, stating Stockholder’s intention to transfer Stockholder’s Shares, the name, address and phone number of each proposed transferee thereof, the aggregate number of Stockholder’s Shares proposed to be transferred to each proposed transferee thereof and the cash price or, in reasonable detail, other consideration for which Stockholder proposes to transfer the Stockholder’s Shares or (viii) engage in a Disposition of Stockholder’s Shares; provided that at the time of Disposition, the maximum aggregate number of Parent Shares that Stockholder shall be entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of (inclusive of all Dispositions that have occurred prior to such Disposition) shall be equal to the product of (A) two percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the total aggregate number of Stockholder’s Shares actually received by Stockholder pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, *times* (B) the number of full weeks that have transpired since the closing of the Merger. For purposes of this Agreement, “immediate family” shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote than first cousin. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, if Stockholder is a corporation, the corporation may transfer the Stockholder’s Shares to any wholly-owned subsidiary of such corporation; provided, however, that in any such case, it shall be a condition to the transfer that the transferee execute an agreement stating that the transferee is receiving and holding such capital stock subject to the provisions of this Agreement and there shall be no further transfer of such capital stock except in accordance with this Agreement, and provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value. Stockholder now has, and, except as contemplated by clause (i) through (viii) above, for the duration of this Agreement will have, good and marketable title to the Stockholder’s Shares, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims whatsoever. The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with Parent’s transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the Stockholder’s Shares except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions. Parent agrees promptly upon Stockholder’s request in connection with a transfer permitted by this Section 1.2 to direct Parent’s transfer agent and registrar to permit such permitted transfers.
