**WHEREAS**, the Note is secured by, among other things, that certain Security Agreement – Accounts and Inventory, executed by Borrower for the benefit of Bank dated [[Date 2]] (the “Security Agreement”); and

**WHEREAS**, Borrower and Bank agreed to modify certain of the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents (as such term is defined below) and agreed to add FFC Grain, L.L.C., an Arkansas limited liability company (“FFC Grain”) as a guarantor of the Loan, pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain First Modification Agreement dated so as to be effective as of [[Date 3: Date]] (the “First Modification”) along with those certain other ancillary documents relating thereto: and

**WHEREAS**, Bank is the present holder of the Note; and

**WHEREAS**, Borrower has requested that Bank further modify certain of the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents, and Bank is willing to so modify certain of the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as are more fully set forth below;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, in consideration of time and certain other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, but subject to all the conditions and provisions contained in the Credit Agreement, the Note, the Security Agreement, the First Modification and all other documents evidencing or securing the Loan (collectively, the "Loan Documents"), except as herein modified, Borrower hereby agrees to and with Bank and its successors and assigns as follows:

^All capitalized terms used herein, except as modified hereby shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Loan Documents.

^The Maturity Date is hereby extended from [[Date 1]] until [[Date 4: Date]], at which time all amounts due and owing under the Note shall be due and payable without notice or demand.

^The language found in Section 3.10 of the Credit Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following language is inserted in lieu thereof:

^^**Unused Line Fee**. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Bank, on the first day of each month for the immediately preceding month, a fee equal to [[Percentage 1: Number]]% per annum of the difference between Fifty Million and 00/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 1]]) and the average monthly Revolving Credit Loan outstanding balance (which

monthly Revolving Credit Loan outstanding balance shall include but not be limited to the aggregate amounts of any and all letters of credit that may be issued by Bank in connection with the sub-line available to Borrower pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 2.02(b) hereof); provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such fee if such fee arises solely due to the Bank's decision to cease making Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrower.”

^The language found in Section 6.01(c) of the Credit Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following language is inserted in lieu thereof:

“(c) **Borrowing Base Certificates**.

In the event that the aggregate amount of the Loans are greater than or equal to Ten Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 2]]), then Borrower shall furnish to the Bank prior to any and all additional borrowings hereunder, but at least monthly, a Borrowing Base Certificate showing, as of the close of business on the last day of the immediately preceding month, the Borrowing Base. Concurrent with the delivery of the Borrowing Base Certificate, Borrower shall pr ovide a written report to Bank of all returns and all material disputes and claims, together with sales and other reports relating to the Accounts and Inventory, as reasonably required by Bank. Bank shall have the right to review and adjust any calculations made by Borrower in a Borrowing Base Certificate (i) to reflect Bank's reasonable estimate of declines in value of any of the Collateral described therein; and (ii) to the extent that such calculation is not in accordance with this Agreement or does not accurately reflect the amount of the Availability Reserve. In no event shall the Borrowing Base on any date be deemed to exceed the amount of the Borrowing Base shown on the Borrowing Base Certificate last received by Bank prior to such date, as such Borrowing Base Certificate may be adjusted from time to time by Bank as authorized herein. If Borrower fails to deliver to Bank the Borrowing Base Certificate on the date when due, then notwithstanding any of the provisions contained herein o r in any other Loan Document to the contrary, Bank may suspend honoring any requests for Loans until a current Borrowing Base Certificate is delivered to Bank.”

^**Schedule 5.01(i)** attached to the Credit Agreement is hereby deleted, and the revised **Schedule 5.01(i)** which is attached to this Agreement shall be inserted in lieu thereof and shall be considered a replacement thereof.

^The obligations of Bank hereunder shall be subject to satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:
