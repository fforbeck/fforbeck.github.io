\centered 10. RAMSumCX  2003

In the event that the series of operations, events or occurrences extend over a period longer than 12 consecutive months, then each consecutive period of 12 months, the first of which commences on the date elected under 2. above, shall form the basis of claim under this Agreement. 

^As respects those Policies of the Company which provide aggregate limits of liability, the total of all individual losses occurring during any one policy year which proceed from or are traceable to the same causative agency.

^As respects an occupational or other disease or cumulative injury under Workers Compensation and Employers Liability, each case of an employee contracting any disease for which the Company may be liable shall be considered a separate and distinct occurrence and the date of each occurrence shall be deemed to be as follows:

However, if notice of claims is first received and recorded by the Company or the insured

\centered 11. RAMSumCX  2003

during an Extended Reporting Period, the date of occurrence shall be deemed to be the last day of the policy period.

Part III  As respects loss occurrence and claims-made Policies involved in the same Loss Occurrence: 

In the event a Loss Occurrence involving one or more Policies written on an occurrence basis and one or more Policies written on a claims-made basis, it is understood that the earliest date on which bodily injury or property damage occurs, and any related claims reported subsequent to such date shall be included in such loss whether they are covered under occurrence or claims-made Policies.

^The Company shall advise the Reinsurer promptly, but in no event later than 30 days, of all losses which, in the opinion of the Company, may result in a claim hereunder and of all subsequent developments thereto which, in the opinion of the Company, may materially affect the position of the Reinsurer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall give notice to the Reinsurer once a claim exceeds the retention of the primary company or has the potential to exceed the retention.

^^^^^ 
^ SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION  
^In the event of the payment of any indemnity by the Reinsurer under this Agreement, the Reinsurer shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all of the rights of the Company against any person or entity legally responsible for damages of the loss. The Company agrees to enforce such rights; but, in case the Company refuses or neglects to do so, the Reinsurer is hereby authorized and empowered to bring any appropriate action in the name of the Company or their policyholders or otherwise to enforce such rights.

^From any amount recovered by subrogation, salvage or other means, there shall first be deducted the expenses incurred in effecting the recovery. The balance shall then be used to reimburse the excess carriers in the inverse order to that in which their respective liabilities attached, before being used to reimburse the Company for its primary loss.

ARTICLE XVI  ACCESS TO RECORDS  
The Reinsurer or its duly authorized representatives shall have the right to examine, at the offices of the Company at a reasonable time, during the currency of this Agreement or anytime thereafter, all books and records of the Company relating to business which is the subject of this Agreement.

Wherever the word “dollars” or the “$” symbol is used in this Agreement, it shall mean dollars of the United States of America, excepting in those cases where the Policy is issued by the Company in Canadian dollars, in which case it shall mean dollars of Canada. In the event the Company is involved in a loss requiring payment in United States and Canadian currency, the Company’s retention and the limit of liability of the Reinsurer shall be apportioned between the two currencies in the same proportion as the amount of net loss in each currency bears to the total amount of net loss paid by the Company. For the purposes of this Agreement, where the Company receives premiums or pays losses in currencies other than United States or Canadian currency, such premiums and losses shall be converted into United States dollars at the actual

ARTICLE XIX  OFFSET

Such offset may include balances due under this Agreement and any other agreements heretofore or hereafter entered into between the parties regardless of whether such balances arise from premiums, losses or otherwise, and regardless of capacity of any party, whether as assuming insurer and/or ceding insurer, under the various agreements involved, provided however, that in the event of insolvency of a party hereto, offsets shall only be allowed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law, statute or regulation governing such offset. 

ARTICLE XX  ERRORS OR OMISSIONS  
Errors or omissions of an administrative nature on the part of the Company shall not invalidate the reinsurance under this Agreement provided such errors or omissions are corrected promptly, but not later than 30 days after discovery thereof; but the liability of the Reinsurer under this Agreement or any exhibits, addenda, or endorsements attached hereto shall in no event exceed the limits specified herein nor be extended to cover any risks, perils, lines of business or classes of insurance generally or specifically excluded herein. 

ARTICLE XXI  INSOLVENCY  
In the event of insolvency and the appointment of a conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor of the Company the portion of any risk or obligation assumed by the Reinsurer shall be payable to the conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor on the basis of claims allowed against the insolvent Company by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor of the Company having authority to allow such claims, without diminution because of that insolvency, or because the conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor has failed to pay all or a portion of any claims. Payments by the Reinsurer shall be made directly to the Company or to its conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor, except where the contract of insurance or reinsurance specially provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company. The conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the policy or bond reinsured, within a reasonable time after such claim is filed and the Reinsurer may interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses which it may deem available to the Company or its conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be payable subject to court approval out of the estate

If a dispute between the Company and the Reinsurer, arising out of the provisions of this Agreement or concerning its interpretation or validity and whether arising before or after termination of this Agreement has not been settled through negotiation, both parties agree to try in good faith to settle such dispute by nonbinding mediation, before resorting to arbitration. The parties shall choose a mediator within thirty (30) days of a written demand by either party for mediation under Part II of this Article XXII. The mediator shall be a disinterested current or retired insurance or reinsurance officer knowledgeable in reinsurance matters. The parties shall have sixty (60) days from the selection of the mediator in which to mediate the dispute to resolution. In the event that mediation fails to resolve the dispute, the parties shall proceed to arbitration in accordance with Part III of this Article XXII. 

Part III  Arbitration  
^Resolution of Disputes  As a condition precedent to any right arising hereunder, any dispute not resolved by mediation between the Company and the Reinsurer arising out of the provisions of this Agreement or concerning its interpretation or validity, whether arising before or after termination of this Agreement, shall be submitted to arbitration in the manner hereinafter set forth.

^Composition of Panel  Unless the parties agree upon a single arbitrator within 15 days after the receipt of a notice of intention to arbitrate, all disputes shall be submitted to an arbitration panel composed of two arbitrators and an umpire chosen in accordance with Paragraph C. hereof. The mediator from Part II many not be an arbitrator or an umpire.

^Appointment of Arbitrators  The members of the arbitration panel shall be chosen from disinterested current or retired insurance or reinsurance officers knowledgeable in reinsurance matters. Unless a single arbitrator is agreed upon, the party requesting arbitration (hereinafter referred to as the “claimant”) shall appoint an

^^^^^ 
arbitrator and give written notice thereof by certified mail, to the other party (hereinafter referred to as the “respondent”) together with his notice of intention to arbitrate.

Within 30 days after receiving such notice, the respondent shall also appoint an arbitrator and notify the claimant thereof by certified mail. Before instituting a hearing, the two arbitrators so appointed shall choose an umpire. If, within 20 days after the appointment of the arbitrator chosen by the respondent, the two arbitrators fail to agree upon the appointment of an umpire, each of them shall nominate three individuals to serve as umpire, of whom the other shall decline two and the umpire shall be chosen from the remaining two by drawing lots. The name of the individual first drawn shall be the umpire. 

^Failure of Party to Appoint an Arbitrator  If the respondent fails to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days after receiving a notice of intention to arbitrate, the claimant’s arbitrator shall appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the respondent, such arbitrator shall then, together with the claimant’s arbitrator, choose an umpire as provided in Paragraph C. of Part III of this Article.

^Involvement of Other Reinsurers  If more than one reinsurer is involved in the same dispute, all such reinsurers shall constitute and act as one party for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of the reinsurers constituting the one party; provided, however, nothing herein shall impair the right of such reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint, defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing the liability of the reinsurers under the terms of this Agreement from several to joint.

^If the Company is involved in a dispute under the terms of this Agreement and in one or more separate disputes with one or more other reinsurers in which common questions of law or fact are in issue, the Company or the Reinsurer, at its option, may join with such other reinsurers in a common arbitration proceeding under the terms of this Article. If the Company and such other reinsurers have commenced arbitration, the Reinsurer may at its option join such proceeding for the determination of the dispute between the Company and the Reinsurer.

^Submission of Dispute to Panel  Unless otherwise extended by the arbitration panel or agreed to by the parties, each party shall submit its case to the panel within 30 days after the selection of the umpire.

^Procedure Governing Arbitration  All proceedings before the panel shall be informal and the panel shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence. The panel shall have the power to fix all procedural rules relating to the arbitration proceeding. In

\centered 17. RAMSumCX  2003 

^^^^^ 
reaching any decision, the panel shall give due consideration to the customs and usages of the insurance and reinsurance business.

^Arbitration Award  The arbitration panel shall render its decision within 60 days after termination of the proceeding, which decision shall be in writing, stating the reasons therefor. The decision of the majority of the panel shall be final and binding on the parties to the proceeding.

^Cost of Arbitration  Unless otherwise allocated by the panel, each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear with the other parties the expense of the umpire and the arbitration.

ARTICLE XXIV  RESERVES  
^If a jurisdiction of the United States will not permit the Reassured, in the statements required to be filed with its regulatory authority(ies), to receive full credit as admitted reinsurance for any Reinsurer’s share of obligations, the Reassured shall forward to such Reinsurer a statement of the Reinsurer’s share of such obligations. Upon receipt of such statement the Reinsurer shall promptly apply for, and provide the Reassured with, a “clean,” unconditional and irrevocable Letter of Credit, in the amount specified in the statement submitted, with terms and bank acceptable to the regulatory authority(ies) having jurisdiction over the Reassured.

^“Obligations,” as used in this Article, shall mean the sum of losses paid and allocated loss adjustment expenses paid by the Reassured but not yet recovered from the Reinsurer, plus reserves for reported losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses and losses incurred but not reported.

\centered 19. RAMSumCX  2003 

^^^^^ 
^The Reinsurer hereby agrees that the Letter of Credit will provide for automatic extension of the Letter of Credit without amendment for one year from the date of expiration of said Letter or any future expiration date unless thirty (30) days prior to any expiration the issuing bank shall notify the Reassured by registered mail that the issuing bank elects not to consider the Letter of Credit renewed for any additional period. An issuing bank, not a “qualified bank” as defined by Regulation No. 133 promulgated by the Insurance Department of the State of New York, shall provide sixty (60) days notice to the Reassured prior to any expiration.

^Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, the Reassured or any successor by operation of law of the Reassured including, without limitation, any Liguidator, rehabilitator, receiver or conservator of the Reassured may draw upon such credit, without diminution because of the insolvency of any party hereto, at any time and undertakes to use and apply such credit for one or more of the following purposes only:

^To pay the Reinsurer’s share or to reimburse the Reassured for the Reinsurer’s share of any obligations, as stipulated in the statement submitted by the Reassured to the Reinsurer, which is due to the Reassured and not otherwise paid by the Reinsurer.

^In the event the Reassured has received effective notice of nonrenewal of the Letter of Credit and the Reinsurer’s liability remains unliquidated and undischarged thirty (30) days prior to the expiry date of the Letter of Credit and place such sums in an interest bearing trust account to secure the continuing liabilities of the Reinsurer under this Contract until a renewal Letter of Credit acceptable to the requlatory authority(ies) having jurisdiction over the Reassured, or a substitute in lieu thereof acceptable to the requlatory authority(ies) having jurisdiction over the Reassured, has been received by the Reassured. The Reassured shall provide to the Reinsurer payment of any interest thereon accruing from such account.

^To make refund of any sum which is in excess of the actual amount required for Sections 1. and 2. of this paragraph.

^At annual intervals or more frequently as determined by the Reassured, but never more frequently than quarterly, the Reassured shall prepare a specific statement, for the sole purpose of amending the Letter of Credit, of the Reinsurer’s share of any obligations. If the statement shows that the Reinsurer’s share of obligations exceeds the balance of credit as of the statement date, the Reinsurer shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of such excess, secure delivery to the Reassured of an amendment of the Letter of Credit increasing the amount of credit by the amount of such difference. If the statement shows, however, that the Reinsurer’s share of obligations is less than the balance of credit as of the statement date, the Reassured shall, within thirty (30)

\centered 20. RAMSumCX  2003 

^^^^^ 
days after receipt of a written request from the Reinsurer, release such excess credit by agreeing to secure an amendment to the Letter of Credit reducing the amount of credit available by the amount of such excess credit.

^The bank shall have no responsibility whatsoever in connection with the propriety of withdrawals made by the Reassured or the disposition of funds withdrawn, except to assure that withdrawals are made only upon the order of properly authorized representatives of the Reassured. The Reassured shall incur no obligation to the bank in acting upon the credit, other than as appears in the express terms thereof.

ARTICLE XXV  SERVICE OF SUIT  
(Paragraphs A. and B. of this Clause only apply to Reinsurers domiciled outside of the United States and/or unauthorized in the State of New York) 

^It is agreed that in the event of the failure of the Reinsurers hereon to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, the Reinsurers hereon, at the request of the Reassured, will submit to the jurisdiction of a Court of competent jurisdiction within the United States. Nothing in this Article constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of Reinsurers’ rights to commence an action in any Court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another Court as permitted by the laws of the United States or of any State in the United States. It is further agreed that service of process in such suit may be made upon Mendes and Mount, [[Address 1: Address]]-6829, and that in any suit instituted against any one of them upon this Contract, such Reinsurer(s) will abide by the final decision of such Court or of any Appellate Court in the event of an appeal.

^The above-named are authorized and directed to accept service of process on behalf of Reinsurers in any such suit and/or upon the request of the Reassured to give a written undertaking to the Reassured that they will enter a general appearance upon Reinsurers’ behalf in the event such a suit shall be instituted.

^Further, pursuant to any statute of any state, territory or district of the United States which makes provision therefore, Reinsurers hereon hereby designate the Superintendent, Commissioner or Director of Insurance or their officer Specified for that purpose in the statute, or his successor or successors in office, as their true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the Reassured or any beneficiary hereunder arising out of this Contract of reinsurance, and hereby designate the above-named as the person

\centered 21. RAMSumCX  2003

to whom the said officer is authorized to mail such process or a true copy thereof.

ARTICLE XXVI  CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE  
All terms and conditions of this Agreement and any materials provided in the course of inspection shall be kept confidential by the Reinsurer as against third parities, unless the disclosure is required pursuant to process of law or unless the disclosure is to Reinsurer’s retrocessionaires, financial auditors or governing regulatory bodies. Disclosing or using this information for any purpose beyond the scope of this Agreement (Contract), or beyond the exceptions set forth above, is expressly forbidden without the prior consent of the Company. 

ARTICLE XXVII  AMENDMENTS  
This Agreement may be amended by mutual consent of the parties expressed in an addendum; and such addendum, when executed by both parties, shall be deemed to be an integral part of this Agreement and binding on the parties hereto. 

ARTICLE XXVIII  FEDERAL TERRORISM EXCESS RECOVERY CLAUSE 

Any loss reimbursement the Company receives from the United States Government under the Terrorism Risk Act of 2002 (“TRIA”) as a result of loss occurrences commencing during the term of this Agreement shall apply as follows: 

Except as provided below, any loss reimbursement under TRIA shall inure solely to the benefit of the Company and shall be entirely disregarded in applying all of the provisions of this Agreement. 

If one or more loss occurrences commencing during the term of this Agreement result(s) in reinsurance recoveries to the Company under this Agreement and reimbursement under TRIA, and such amounts, together with any other reinsurance recoveries to the Company for said loss occurrence(s), exceed the total amount of “Insured Losses” to the Company, any amount in excess thereof shall be held by the Company. The Company shall then reimburse the Reinsurer a portion of such excess recovery in an amount equal to the proportion that the Reinsurer’s payment under this Agreement bears to the total treaty reinsurance recoveries to the Company for Insured Losses for said loss occurrence(s). *Provided, however,* that in no event shall such reimbursement exceed the amount paid by the Reinsurer to the Company under this Agreement. 

\centered 22. RAMSumCX  2003 

^^^^^ 
For purposes hereof, if a loss reimbursement received by the Company under TRIA is based on the Company’s Insured Losses in more than one loss occurrence and neither the Secretary of the Treasury nor his delagatee specifies the amount of loss allocable to each respective loss occurrence, the reimbursement shall be pro-rated in the proportion that the Company’s Insured Losses in each loss occurrence bears to the Company’s total Insured Losses resulting from all loss occurrences to which the reimbursement applies. 

For purposes of this endorsement: (i) :“TRIA” shall mean the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 and any subsequent amendments thereto; and (ii) “Insured Loss(es)” shall have the same meaning as set forth in Section 102 (5) of TRIA. 

ARTICLE XXIX  ENTIRE AGREEMENT
