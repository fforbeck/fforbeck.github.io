the Agent shall, with the agreement of each Lender or (as the case may be) each Affected Lender, set an interest rate representing the cost of funding of such Lenders in Dollars of their respective Contributions plus the Margin (the "**Substitute Basis**") and give notice thereof to the Borrowers.";
