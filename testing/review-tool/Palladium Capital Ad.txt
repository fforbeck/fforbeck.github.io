Re: **Placement Agent Agreement**  
Dear Mr. Dang:  
This will confirm the understanding and agreement (the “Agreement”) between [[Palladium]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (“Palladium”), and [[Company]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (the “Company”), as follows:

^The Company hereby engages Palladium on a best efforts basis as its agent in a private placement pursuant to which the Company is selling a minimum (the “Minimum Number”) of 9,400,000 units and up to a maximum (the “Maximum Number”) of 20,000,000 units (collectively, the “Units”), of the Company’s securities at a price of $[[USD Value 3: Number]] per Unit, on a “best efforts, all or none” basis with respect to the Minimum Number and on a “best efforts” basis with respect to the remaining 10,600,000 Units (the “Offering”) with each Unit consisting of (i) one (1) share of common Stock; (ii) one half of one five year Series E Stock Purchase Warrant that has an exercise price of $[[USD Value 4: Number]] per share; and (iii) one half of one five year Series F Stock Purchase Warrant that has an exercise price of $[[USD Value 5: Number]] per share (the “Offering”).

^The appointment and authorization of Palladium under Section 1 of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall expire on the earlier of the termination of (i) this Agreement or (ii) the termination of the Offering (the “Term”).

^The Company acknowledges and agrees that Palladium will be using, and relying upon, the Company to furnish Palladium, upon request, with written materials and information, including but not limited to financial statements, to be provided to potential Investors (the “Materials”) describing the Company and the Offering concerning the Company’s business, operations, assets, liabilities and receivables, and Palladium will be using, and relying upon, such Materials supplied by the Company, its officers, agents, and others and any other publicly available information without any independent investigation or verification thereof or independent appraisal by Palladium of the Company or its business or assets. (For purposes hereof, the “Investors” mean a limited number of institutional, accredited individual or strategic investors.) Palladium does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the Materials, including but not limited to any disclosure materials related to the Offering, except for such information that is independently produced and provided in writing by Palladium to the Company for inclusion in the Materials. The Company shall provide Palladium with access to the Company’s officers, directors, accountants, counsel and other advisors, and shall keep Palladium fully informed of any events that might have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company. The Company represents and warrants to Palladium that all information concerning the Company, including, without limitation, all information contained in the Materials, will be true, complete and accurate in all material respects and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which such statements are made. If at any time prior to the completion of the Offering an event occurs which wouldcause the Materials (as supplemented or amended) to contain an untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company will notify Palladium immediately of such event.

^(a) The Company agrees to pay Palladium, upon each closing with Investors in connection with the Offering (each, a “Closing”), the following compensation: (i) [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the aggregate cash consideration raised in such Closing from such Investors, and (ii) warrants to purchase such number of shares of the common stock of the Company equal to [[Percentage 1]]% of the aggregate number of fully diluted and/or converted shares of common stock as are purchased by Investors taking into consideration any increase in shares on the same terms and conditions as the warrants purchased by the Investors (the “Warrants”). Half of the Warrants that Palladium will receive will be Series E Stock Purchase Warrants and half of the Warrants that Palladium will receive will be Series F Stock Purchase Warrants.

^^The Company agrees to pay or issue to Palladium, upon and in the event of receipt by the Company of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] from Ralph Reider or one of his affiliates on or before [[Date 2: Date]], Two Million (2,000,000) fully paid and non-assessable shares of the common stock of the Company (the “Compensation Shares”).

^^The Compensation Shares are payable solely upon consummation of the acquisition of the stock or assets of AquaMed Technologies, Inc. by the Company and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4(b) above. The fees set forth in Section 4(a) are payable for (i) any Closing that occurs during the Term with respect to Investors introduced by Palladium, or (ii) any private placement of unregistered securities by the Company (a “Private Placement”) at any time during the 18-month period following the Term if such Private Placement involves an Investor introduced by Palladium that has previously concluded a Closing with the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein (including Section 2 of this Agreement), after the initial Closing, Palladium shall only receive the compensation set forth in Section 4(a) above solely with respect to Investors introduced to the Company by Palladium and shall not receive any compensation from proceeds received by the Company from Investors that were not introduced to the Company by Palladium.

^^The Warrants will be purchased for a nominal sum and will have the same terms as the Series E and Series F Stock Purchase Warrants, as the case may be.

^^All cash compensation payable hereunder by the Company to Palladium shall be paid by wire transfer.

^The Company shall reimburse Palladium for its reasonable and customary out-of-pocket and incidental expenses incurred during the Term, including the fees and expenses of its legal counsel and those of any advisor retained by Palladium, not to exceed $[[USD Value 2: Number]] in the aggregate.

^The Company agrees to provide indemnification as set forth in Annex A attached hereto and made a part hereof.

^Upon a Closing, the Company agrees that Palladium has the right to place notices and/or advertisements in financial and other newspapers and journals (whether in print or on the internet), and to publicize on its own website and/or marketing materials, at its own expense, describing its services to the Company hereunder.

^The provisions of Sections 4, 5, and 6 (including, without limitation, the provisions of indemnification referred to in Section 6) shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

^The Company represents to Palladium that there is no other person or entity that is or will be entitled to a finder's fee or any type of brokerage commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a result of any agreement or understanding with it; provided, however, it is understood and agreed that Palladium may work on the Offering with one or more co-placement agents and it shall be the sole responsibility of Palladium to compensate such co-placement agents for their fees related to such work. 

^Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of Palladium or of any member, employee, agent or representative of Palladium, to be a shareholder, member, partner, director, officer, employee, agent or representative of, or to engage in, any other business, whether of a similar nature or not, nor to limit or restrict the right of Palladium to render services of any kind to any other corporation, company, firm, individual or association.

^The failure or neglect of the parties hereto to insist, in any one or more instances, upon the strict performance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, or their waiver of strict performance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment in the future of such term or condition, but the same shall continue in full force and effect.

^Any notices hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be sent to the Company and to Palladium at their respective addresses set forth above. Any notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed to have been given when deposited in the United States mail.
