\centered **ETHANOL MARKETING AGREEMENT**

This ETHANOL MARKETING AGREEMENT (this “**Agreement**”) is entered into by and between [[AEAFK]], a Delaware Corporation (“**AEAFK**”), and [[Kinergy]], an [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (“**Kinergy**”), as of this [[Date 2: Date]]. AEAFK and Kinergy are each individually referred to herein as a “**Party**”, and collectively are referred to herein as the “Parties”.

\centered **RECITALS**

^Kinergy provides marketing services for denatured fuel ethanol production facilities.

^AEAFK is the Lessee of an approximately 55 million gallon-per-year denatured fuel ethanol production facility in AEAFK, California (the “**Facility**”) and AEAFK has requested that Kinergy provide denatured fuel ethanol marketing services for the Facility.

^Kinergy desires to provide such marketing services in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

\centered **AGREEMENT**

NOW, THEREFORE,in consideration of the agreements and covenants hereinafter set forth, and intending to be legally bound, the Parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:

\centered **MARKETING ACTIVITIES**

^^**Marketing of Ethanol Production**.  
^^Subject to the terms hereof, AEAFK shall sell and make available for delivery and Kinergy shall purchase and take delivery in accordance with Section 1.3 of [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the Ethanol produced by the Facility.

^^AEAFK shall provide Ethanol to Kinergy free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and otherwise operate the Facility as required to allow Kinergy to perform its obligations hereunder.

^^Kinergy shall perform its obligations hereunder in accordance with this Agreement, applicable Laws, applicable Permits and Good Industry Practice and with the intent to maximize the proceeds generated from the sale of Ethanol.

^^Kinergy shall confer with AEAFK no less frequently than weekly regarding marketing strategy. AEAFK will have the option to participate in the “Pool” described in Section 2 herein by stating its election to participate on the execution of this Agreement. If AEAFK later desires to opt out of the Pool, AEAFK may due so on thirty (30) days written notice, in which event AEAFK’s Ethanol will continue to be marketed by Kinergy at AEAFK’s direction, but the provisions of Section 2.2 shall supersede the “Pool” pricing and other provisions of Section 2.1 .

^^**Obligations of** **AEAFK**.  
^^AEAFK shall provide Kinergy with all information reasonably requested by Kinergy.

^^AEAFK shall provide Kinergy with a best estimate of a projected Date of First Delivery covering a range of seven (7) days. AEAFK shall use reasonable best efforts to update this estimate as more accurate information is available, but shall not be liable to Kinergy for a failure to achieve the projected Date of First Delivery.

^^AEAFK shall provide a best estimate of the amount of Ethanol production on a daily basis for the six (6) month period following the estimated Date of First Delivery. After the Date of First Delivery, AEAFK shall provide monthly updates to Kinergy, by the 15th day of each month, estimating the daily production for the next six (6) month period beginning the first month following the date of the last estimate. AEAFK shall promptly notify Kinergy of any adjustments to the Ethanol production schedule that has been most recently given to Kinergy or of any actual or anticipated production downtime or disruption to Ethanol availability.& #160; In the event (1) the Facility is unable to produce sufficient Ethanol quantities to meet the production estimates delivered to Kinergy, (2) such inability to produce is not the result of Force Majeure, and (3) Kinergy would otherwise suffer a loss as a result of being unable to deliver Ethanol to a Third Party customer to whom Kinergy is contractual committed to deliver Ethanol, then in such case Kinergy may purchase or arrange for the purchase of such shortfall from other sources and incur additional transportation and similar expense to the extent necessary to cover contractual commitments Kinergy has made in respect of AEAFK’s anticipated production. Kinergy shall use reasonable commercial efforts to mitigate the cost of such cover. Kinergy will provide AEAFK written substantiation of such costs reasonably satisfactory to AEAFK as soon as reasonably possible. AEAFK shall be obligated to pay Kinergy the net cost of such cover within seven (7) days thereafter. div>  
^^AEAFK shall provide storage tank capacity at the Facility for Ethanol in an amount of one million gallons. AEAFK’s Ethanol production at [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of nameplate design and [[Percentage 1]]% of permitted capacity is 170,454 gallons per day for 352 days per year.

^^Kinergy shall be given reasonable access to the delivery point(s) at the Facility during normal business hours upon reasonable prior notice; **provided**, that Kinergy’s access shall be without disruption to AEAFK’s business operations at the Facility. Kinergy will provide AEAFK with delivery schedules and, at the sole cost of Kinergy, make arrangements for transportation of the Ethanol. AEAFK shall handle and supervise the loading and delivery of Ethanol, prepare delivery documentation and generally be responsible for all matters ancillary to such activities. All equipment necessary to load trucks at the delivery point shall be supplied by AEAFK without charge to Kinergy. Kinergy shall require the transportation companies it employs to comply with the Facility’s safety regulations.

^^AEAFK shall deliver Ethanol to Kinergy under this Agreement that meets the specifications set forth in **Exhibit B**. If any government entity requires a change in the specifications set forth in **Exhibit B**, Kinergy shall notify AEAFK of the change in specifications. AEAFK and Kinergy agree to change the specifications of Ethanol in this Agreement within a reasonable time as agreed to by Kinergy and AEAFK. If the Ethanol Delivered by AEAFK does not meet the specifications as set forth above when delivered by AEAFK and quality claims arise as a result thereof, such quality cl aims will be administered by Kinergy upon notice and consultation with AEAFK. Such claims shall be solely for AEAFK’s account and Kinergy shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for such claims.

^^Kinergy shall generate and deliver Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) and Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits for Ethanol delivered under this Agreement as per Good Industry Practice. AEAFK is responsible for submitting quarterly and annual reports to the US EPA or California ARB related to RIN and LCFS programs.

^^**Title; Delivery Point; Nominations; Measurement**.

^^AEAFK shall deliver Ethanol to Kinergy at the inlet flange of the applicable receiving truck that will remove such Ethanol from the Facility. Title to, risk of loss with respect to and the obligation to transport such Ethanol shall pass from AEAFK to Kinergy at such delivery point.

^^Prior to the Date of First Delivery, Kinergy and AEAFK shall agree on an operating protocol with respect to the mechanics, timing and process for (i) determining how much Ethanol is available to be sold on any particular day, (ii) determining the quantity of Ethanol to be stored by AEAFK in its storage facilities, (iii) identifying Persons to transport the Ethanol, and (iv) implementing the Ethanol sales contemplated by this Agreement. By mutual agreement, such operating protocol shall be updated from time to time thereafter.

^^AEAFK agrees to collect representative “batch” samples of Ethanol it delivers to Kinergy hereunder pursuant to Good Industry Practice. Kinergy shall have the right, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times and at its expense, to test such samples to confirm that the Ethanol delivered to it hereunder meets the requirements of this Agreement.

^^The quantity of Ethanol delivered to Kinergy by AEAFK from the Facility shall be established by outbound meter tickets expressed in net temperature-corrected gallons in accordance with Good Industry Practice. The meter tickets shall be obtained from meters which are certified as of the time of loading and which comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The outbound meter tickets shall be determinative in the absence of manifest error (greater than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% variation) of the quantity of Ethanol for which Kinergy is obligated to pay pursuant to Section 2.

^^**Plant Startup Services**. Kinergy shall provide consulting services to AEAFK during the retrofit and startup period, including but not limited to advice on operations, inventory management, laboratory services, employee training, safety & environmental policies and training, engineering review, and project management.

^^In the event that the actual Net Purchase Price for a given month is different from the estimated Net Purchase Price used in calculating payments under Section 2.2(d), then an adjustment to the Net Purchase Price in a later month shall be made by as provided in Section 2.2(d). Such adjustment is the “**True-Up**.”

^^For all quantities of Ethanol purchased by Kinergy from AEAFK and shipped from the Facility, Kinergy shall pay an estimated Net Purchase Price to AEAFK by ACH or wire no later than three (3) days following delivery to Kinergy. If at calendar month’s end, the actual Net Purchase Price for that month’s deliveries exceeds the estimated Net Purchase Price for that month’s deliveries, Kinergy shall pay AEAFK on or before the 15th business day of the following calendar month an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the actual and estimated Net Purchase Price and (y) the aggregate quantity of Ethanol purchased by Kinergy from AEAFK and shipped from the Facility under this Agreement during the prior calendar month. If the actual Net Purchase Price for that month’s deliveries is less than the estimated Net Purchase Price for that month’s deliveries, AEAFK shall pay Kinergy and Kinergy shall have the right to withhold and set off from future payments to AEAFK on the 15th business day of the following calendar month, an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the actual and estimated Net Purchase Price and (y) the aggregate quantity of Ethanol purchased by Kinergy from AEAFK and shipped from the Facility under this Agreement during such month.

^^**Audit**. Notwithstanding the payment of any amount pursuant to this Article II, AEAFK shall remain entitled (upon reasonable prior notice, at reasonable times and at Kinergy’s corporate offices) to conduct a subsequent audit and review of (a) transactions and related records to verify the amount of gross payments, Marketing Fees, Pool Expenses, all other expenses and damage payments and (b) the determination and calculation of the per gallon sale price, in each case for a period of two years from and after the end of the applicable month. If, pursuant to such audit and review, it is determined that any amount previously paid by Kinergy to AEAFK did not constitute all of the amounts which should have been paid to AEAFK, AEAFK shall advise Kinergy indicating such amount and reason the amount should have been paid to AEAFK and, subject to the next two sentences, Kinergy shall pay such amount to AEAFK within five Business Days of such request along with interest accrued at the rate of [[Percentage 5]]% per annum from the date originally due until the date paid.
