^^Special Allocations.

^^Minimum Gain Chargeback. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if there is a net decrease in Company minimum gain (as defined in Section 1.704-2(d)(2) of the Regulations), items of income and gain shall be allocated to all Members in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(f), and such allocations are intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirements of Regulations Section 1.704-2 and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

^^Section 704(c) Allocation. Solely for Federal, state, and local income tax purposes and not for book or Capital Account purposes, depreciation, amortization, gain, or loss with respect to property that is properly reflected on the Company’s books at a value that differs from its adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes shall be allocated in accordance with the principles and requirements of 704(c) of the Code and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, and in accordance with the requirements of the relevant provisions of the Regulations issued under Code Section 704(b). The Company will use the traditional method with curative allocations as described in Regulation Section 1.704-3(c) to take into account income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to property described herein.

^^Allocation of Excess Nonrecourse Liabilities. For the purpose of determining each Member’s share of Company nonrecourse liabilities pursuant to Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3), and solely for such purpose, each Member’s interest in Company profits is hereby specified to be such Member’s Membership Interest.

^^Unexpected Allocations and Distributions. No allocation may be made to a Member to the extent such allocation causes or increases a deficit balance in such Member’s Adjusted Capital Account. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement except Sections 8.2(i) and 8.2(iii) above, in the event that a Member unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or distribution described in Regulations Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) which results in such Member having a negative Adjusted Capital Account balance (as determined above), then such Member shall be allocated items of income and gain in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Regulations, such negative balance in such Member’s Adjusted Capital Account as quickly as possible. This provision is intended to satisfy the “qualified income offset” requirements of the Regulations.

Upon the transfer of all or any part of a Membership Interest as permitted by this Agreement, the Capital Account (or portion thereof) of the transferor that is attributable to the transferred interest (or portion thereof) shall carry over to the transferee, as prescribed by Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(l).

The Board shall notify each Member of any change in the method of allocating Company income or loss in accordance with this paragraph promptly after the occurrence thereof.

^^Adjustment of Capital Accounts. After all allocations for a taxable year are made, Capital Accounts shall be adjusted by the Company to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations and administrative pronouncements. The tax allocation provisions of this Agreement are intended to produce final Capital Account balances that are at levels (“**Target Final Balances**”)which permit liquidating distributions that are made in accordance with such final Capital Account balances to be equal to the distributions that would occur under Section 9 hereof if such liquidating proceeds were distributed pursuant to Section 9. To the extent that the tax allocation provisions of this Agreement would not produce the Target Final Balances, the Members agree to take such actions as are necessary to amend such tax allocation provisions to produce such Target Final Balances. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction (including items of gross income, gain, loss and deduction) shall be made prospectively as necessary to produce such Target Final Balances (and, to the extent such prospective allocations would not effect such result, the prior tax returns of the Company shall be amended to reallocate items of gross income, gain, loss and deductions to produce such Target Final Balances).

^^Change in Economic Arrangement; Membership Interest. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Membership Interest of any Member is adjusted at any time pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Member whose Membership Interest is increased pursuant to such adjustment shall have the right to amend this Agreement to take into account the revised economic arrangement of the Members, but only to the extent required to satisfy the tax allocation rules of Section 704 of the Code and the Regulations thereunder based on the opinion of legal counsel selected by such Member.

^^Calculation of Income, Gain, Loss and Deductions.

^^Any income of the Company described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) of the Code that is exempt from Federal income tax and not otherwise taken into account shall be added to such taxable income or subtracted from such taxable loss, as the case may be.

^^Any expenditures of the Company described in Section 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code or treated as Section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures pursuant to Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(i) of the Regulations)and not otherwise taken into account shall be subtracted from taxable income or added to such taxable loss, as the case may be.

^^In the event the value at which any Company asset is reflected in Capital Accounts is adjusted pursuant to Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(f) of the Regulations, the amount of such adjustment shall be taken into account as gain or loss from the disposition of such asset.

^^Gain or loss resulting from any disposition of an asset with respect to which gain or loss is recognized for Federal income tax purposes shall be computed by reference to the value at which the asset disposed of is properly reflected in the Capital Accounts of the Members pursuant to Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(iv) of the Regulations.

^^In lieu of depreciation, amortization and other cost recovery deductions taken into account in computing taxable income or loss, there shall be taken into account depreciation, cost recovery or amortization computed in accordance with Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(g)(3) of the Regulations.

The tax matters partner shall inform each other Member of all significant matters that may come to the tax matter member’s attention in its capacity as tax matters member by giving notice thereof and, within a reasonable time, shall forward to each other Member copies of all significant written communications it may receive as tax matters partner.

In the event of a distribution of property made in the manner provided in Section 734 of the Code, or in the event of a transfer of any Membership Interest permitted by this Agreement made in the manner provided in Section 743 of the Code, the Board may, but shall not be required to, instruct one of the Company’s officers to file an election under Section 754 of the Code in accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable Treasury Regulations.

^^Income Tax Liability. Each Member shall be solely responsible for all taxes as may be applicable to any funds paid or credited to such Member or income deemed taxable to such Member under this Agreement and no Member shall be liable to any extent in connection with such taxes payable by any other Member.

^^Distribution of Cash Flow. Except as otherwise provided herein, distributions shall be made to the Members in such amounts and at such intervals as the Board, in its discretion, shall determine. Distributions, to the extent made, shall be made pro rata according to each Member’s Membership Interest.

^^Priority and Distribution of Assets. No Member shall have priority over any other Member either as to the return of capital or as to distributions.

^^Minimum Distributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Member is allocated income which exceeds, on a cumulative basis, the amount of losses previously allocated to such Member for tax purposes (the “**Excess Income Allocation**”),then the Company shall distribute amounts in accordance with Membership Interests so that each Memer receives at least the “Minimum Distribution”. The Minimum Distribution is the amount, if any, by which (i) the Excess Income Allocation multiplied by the combined maximum federal and state income tax rates applicable to such Member (reduced to reflect the maximum federal tax benefit from the deduction of state income taxes), exceeds (ii) the amount previously distributed to such Member with respect to the Fiscal Year for which such taxes are payable.

^^Distribution in Kind. If any assets of the Company are to be distributed in kind (other than a distribution which is a liquidating distribution to a redeemed Member), each Member receives such interest therein as a tenant-in-common with all other Members so entitled in the same proportions as they would have shared in a cash distribution equal to the value of such property at the time of such distribution. Any difference between the fair market value and the amount at which such assets are carried on the books of the Company is to be recorded as income or loss, as the case may be, and allocated to the Members immediately prior to such distribution as set forth in Section 8.1 or 8.2, as applicable, and allocated to each Member’s Capital Account as required by Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(e). Such assets are to be distributed on the basis of the fair market value thereof.

\centered **ADMISSION OF MEMBERS**

^^Prohibition on Transfer. Except as expressly permitted herein, no Member shall sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of (collectively referred to as “**Transfer**”) all or any portion of its Membership Interests and any attempt to do so shall be null and void.

^^Permitted Transfers. Members shall have the unrestricted right to transfer (including, without limitation, by foreclosure) Membership Interest (a) to any lender as collateral security, or (b) to any Subsidiary of such Member, or any Person of which the Member is a Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of such Person, (c) to a transferee in connection with a sale of a Member by way of merger, stock sale, or asset sale.

^^Buy/Sell Rights. If any Member desires to sell its Membership Interest (the “**Offeror**”)then the Offeror shall present a written offer (“**Sale Proposal**”) to sell its Membership Interest at a specified price to the other Member (the “**Offeree**”).If the Offeree accepts the Sale Proposal, then the parties shall proceed to close on the sale and purchase of such Membership Interest. If the Offeree is interested in purchasing the Membership Interest but believes the valuation is different from the price specified in the Sale Proposal, the Offeree may request, at its expense, a Final Market Valuation of the Company, in which case the Offeror and Offeree shall cooperate and take all efforts necessary to obtain such Final Market Valuation pursuant to Section 10.3(a), and following which the Offeror and Offeree shall undertake in good faith the sale procedures described in Section 10.3(c) below.

^^Procedures for Market Valuation. In the event a market valuation of the Company is required to be completed pursuant to this Agreement, the Offeror and the Offeree shall select two investment bankers or qualified appraisers of national reputation (“**Appraiser**”) by mutual agreement or, if they cannot agree, each of Ballantyne and REAL D shall select one Appraiser, to provide an appraisal of the fair market value of the Company net of outstanding liabilities (“**Market Valuation**”).Each of the Appraisers appointed by the Offeror and the Offeree shall be directed to provide, within 30 business days following the receipt by the Offeree of the Offeror’s Sale Proposal, each of the Offeror and the Offeree with a written report of the Appraisers’ respective Market Valuations (the date of the later submission being referred to herein as the “**Submission Date**”).If the lower of the two Market Valuations is greater than or equal to [[Percentage 7: Number]]% of the higher Market Valuation, the final aggregate Market Valuation (the “**Final Market Valuation**”)shall be the average of the two Market Valuations submitted by such Appraisers. If the lower of the two Market Valuations does not equal [[Percentage 7]]% or more of the higher Market Valuation, within ten business days following the Submission Date the two Appraisers selected by the Offeror and Offeree shall jointly select a third Appraiser to perform a third Market Valuation and submit it to the Offeror and Offeree within 20 business days following its selection to provide such valuation. The Final Market Valuation shall be the average of the two Market Valuations provided by the Appraisers which are closest in value to each other, and such average shall constitute the Final Market Valuation and shall be final and conclusive. Each of the Company and the Members agree to make reasonably available any such books or records as any of the parties involved in the valuation process described in this Section 10.1(a) may reasonably require in order to reach a Market Valuation.

^^Sale by a Member. (a) If the Final Market Valuation is performed, and it is at least [[Percentage 7]]% of the price contained in the Sale Proposal, the Offeree can purchase the Offeror’s Membership Interest at the Sale Proposal price or elect to sell the Company. If the Final Market Valuation is less than [[Percentage 7]]% of the Sale Proposal Price, the Offeror can elect to sell its Membership Interest at the Final Market Valuation Price, if the Offeree is still willing to purchase the Membership Interest or the Offeror can revoke its offer. If the Final Valuation Prices is more than the price contained in the Sale Proposal, the Offeree has the option to purchase the Offeror’s Membership Interest for the Fair Market Valuation, or initiate a sale of the Company.

^^Procedures for Sale of the Company. If the Offeree elects to initiate a sale of the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(b) above, the Board shall select and retain an investment banking firm of national reputation to arrange such sale at a target price (“**Target Price**”) equal to (x) the price contained in the Sale Proposal if the Final Market valuation was at least [[Percentage 7]]% of such price, or (y) the Final Market Valuation if the Final Market Valuation was less than [[Percentage 7]]% of the price contained in the Sale Proposal. If at least one bona fide offer to purchase the Company for cash and/or Freely Tradeable Securities on customary terms is received from a buyer at a price of at least [[Percentage 7]]% of the Target Price (excluding for these purposes, any earn-out payments, amounts held in escrow or other forms of contingent payments) such offer shall be accepted and the parties shall proceed to consummate the sale. [If the highest price offer to purchase the Company is for a price less than [[Percentage 7]]% of the Target Price (“**Best Offer Price**”),the Offeror may (a) revoke the Sale Proposal and abandon the process of selling the Company pursuant to this Section 10.1(c), or (b) notify the Offeree that it desires to accept the Best Offer Price within 30 days of receipt thereof. If the Offeror elects (b), the Offeree shall then notify the Offeror, within 15 days of receiving such notice described in (b), whether it (x) will purchase the Offeror’s Membership Interest for the Best Offer Price or (y) desires to proceed with a sale of the Company to the third party who offered the Best Offer Price. For the purposes hereof, “Freely Tradable Securities” shall mean securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange or eligible for trading on the Nasdaq National Market, and which are not subject to restriction on transferability, whether pursuant to Rule 144, Rule 145, other provisions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, any contractual restriction or otherwise.

^^Closing; Payment of Purchase Price. The closing of the sale of the Offerer’s Membership Interest to the Offeree (the “**Closing**”) shall take place within 60 days after the Offeree agrees to such sale as set forth in this Section 10; unless the Offeror and Offeree mutually agree to hold the Closing at a different time. The purchase price for such sale shall be payable in cash by check or wire transfer of funds at the Closing.

^^Deadlock by the Board/Members. In the event any of the following has occurred and is continuing, the Members shall initiate the sale procedures specified in 10.3 above:

^^^A deadlock by the Board regarding any matter; or

^^^the failure of either any Member to approve any matter pursuant to Section 3.3(b) which was approved by the Board.

^^Involuntary Transfer. In the event any of the Membership Interests of a Member are acquired by any Person other than the other Member(s) by “involuntary transfer” (i.e., any transfer or disposition of such interests by judicial order, foreclosure, legal process, execution, attachment or other similar procedure or process), then the other Member(s) (or Member designee) shall have the option for one year after receipt of actual notice of such involuntary transfer (or otherwise becoming aware of such involuntary transfer) to exercise the remedy such Member would have had under Sections 11.2(a) or 11.2(b), below, as the case may be, had there been an Event of Disassociation and such Member was not the Disassociating Member. The option set forth herein shall be exercisable by providing the transferee with 10 days’ notice. Each Member shall use its best efforts to prevent any involuntary transfer of its Membership Interests. An involuntary transfer shall not release any Membership Interests held or previously held by any Member from the provisions of this Agreement or release any Member from its obligations hereunder or from any default created by such transfer.

^^Definitions and Cure Periods. The occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute an event of disassociation (“**Event** of Disassociation**”) on the part of the Member with respect to whom such event occurs (“**Disassociating** Member**”), if within 30 days following notice of such disassociation from another Member, the Disassociating Member fails to commence substantial efforts to cure such disassociation or thereafter fails within a reasonable time to prosecute to completion with diligence and continuity the curing of such disassociation; provided, however, that at the election (without any obligation to give notice) of the non-disassociating Member(s), occurrence of any of the events described in subparagraphs (i) - (iv) below shall constitute an Event of Disassociation immediately upon such occurrence without any requirement of notice or passage of time except as specifically set forth in any such subparagraph:

^^^dissolution of Member; or

^^assignment by a Member of its Membership Interest in contravention of this Agreement.

^^Remedies of Non-Disassociating Member

^^^Upon the occurrence of an Event of Disassociation by any Member, the non-disassociating Member (or its designee) shall have the right to acquire the Membership Interests of the Disassociating Member for cash at a price equal to: (a) if such Event of Disassociation constitutes an Event of Disassociation under Section 11.1(v), [[Percentage 8: Number]]% of the fair market value of the Disassociating Member’s Membership Interests, as determined in the same manner as provided in Section 10.3(a) (except that the Disassociating Member shall pay for the costs related to the appraisal); and (b) if such Event of Disassociation constitutes an Event of Disassociation under any other subsections of Section 11, [[Percentage 9: Number]]% of the fair market value of the Disassociating Member’s Membership Interests, as determined in the same manner as provided in Section 10.3(a), in either case such value to be determined as of the time immediately following such Event of Disassociation. In furtherance of such right, the non-disassociating Member may notify the Disassociating Member at any time following an Event of Disassociation of the election to institute the procedure set forth herein.

The Company may indemnify its other officers, employees and authorized agents, acting within the scope of their duties as such, to the same extent as Members, Managers and officers hereunder.
