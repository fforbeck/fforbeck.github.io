^^**Mechanics of Exercise**.  
^^^**Authorization of Warrant Shares**. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges imposed by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue).

^^^**Delivery of Certificates Upon Exercise**. Certificates for shares purchased hereunder shall be transmitted by the transfer agent of the Company to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder’s prime broker with the Depository Trust Company through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission (“***DWAC***”) system if the Company is a participant in such system, and otherwise by physical delivery to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise within three (3) trading days from the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise Form, surrender of this Warrant and payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as set forth above (“***Warrant Share Delivery Date***”). This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised on the date the Exercise Price and completed Notice of Exercise are received by the Company. The Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised by payment to the Company of the Exercise Price and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, pursuant to **Section 2(d)(vi)** prior to the issuance of such shares, have been paid.

^^^**Delivery of New Warrants Upon Exercise**. If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the time of delivery of the certificate or certificates representing Warrant Shares, deliver to Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant.

^^^**Buy-In Rights**. In addition to any other rights available to a Holder, if the Company fails to deliver to the Holder a certificate representing Warrant Shares by the fifth trading day after the date on which delivery of such certificate is required by this Warrant, and if after such fifth trading day the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares that the Holder anticipated receiving from the Company (a “**Buy-In**”), then the Company shall, within ten trading days after the Holder’s request, honor its obligation to deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing such Common Stock and pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the amount equal to the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased over the product of (A) such number of shares of Common Stock, times (B) the Closing Price on the date of the event giving rise to the Company’s obligation to deliver such certificate.

\centered C-3

^^^**No Fractional Shares or Scrip**. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Exercise Price.

^^^**Charges, Taxes and Expenses**. Issuance of certificates for Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder; provided, however, that in the event certificates for Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder; and the Company may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto.

^^^**Closing of Books**. The Company will not close its stockholder books or records prior to the Termination Date in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.

^**Certain Adjustments**.  
^^**Stock Dividends and Splits**. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (A) pays a stock dividend or otherwise make a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company pursuant to this Warrant), (B) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (C) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (D) issues by reclassification of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted. Any adjustment made pursuant to this **Section 3(a)** shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.

\centered C-4

^^**Additional Issuances of Equity Securities**. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall issue or sell any Equity Securities (as defined below) at an effective price per share less than the then effective Exercise Price (such lower price, the “***Base Share Price***” and such issuances collectively, a “***Dilutive Issuance***”), as adjusted hereunder (if the holder of the Equity Securities so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, conversion, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options or rights per share which is issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share which is less than the Exercise Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Exercise Price on such date of the Dilutive Issuance), then, the Exercise Price shall be reduced and only reduced to equal the Base Share Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustments shall be made, paid or issued under this **Section 3(b)** in respect of Exempt Issuances (as defined below). The Company shall notify the Holder in writing as promptly as reasonably possible following the issuance of any Equity Securities subject to this section, indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or of applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice the “***Dilutive Issuance Notice***”). For purposes of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this **Section 3(b)**, upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance while this Warrant is outstanding, after the date of such Dilutive Issuance the Holder is entitled to the Base Share Price regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Share Price in the Notice of Exercise.

For purposes of this Section 3(b), the following definitions shall apply:

“***Common Stock Equivalents***” means any securities of the Company or its subsidiaries which would entitle the holder thereof to acquire at any time Common Stock, including, without limitation, any debt, preferred stock, rights, options, warrants or other instrument that is at any time convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or otherwise entitles the holder thereof to receive, Common Stock.

“***Equity Securities***” means (i) Common Stock and (ii) Common Stock Equivalents.

“***Exempt Issuance***” means (i) any Equity Securities issued or issuable pursuant to options, warrants or other rights issued or issuable to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the Company or any subsidiary, pursuant to equity incentive plans or other employee benefit arrangements; (ii) any Equity Securities issued or issuable pursuant to any rights or agreements, options, warrants or convertible securities outstanding as of the Closing Date; (iii) any Equity Securities issued or issuable for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, strategic alliance, acquisition or similar business combination; (iv) any Equity Securities issued or issuable in connection with any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization by the Company; (v) any Equity Securities issued or issuable pursuant to any equipment loan or leasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement, or debt financing from a bank or similar financial or lending institution; and (vi) any Equity Securities issued or issuable to the Placement Agent or its affiliates. For clarification purposes, warrants that are issued at a Base Share Price pursuant to the Memorandum at closings subsequent to the issuance of this Warrant shall **not** be deemed to be an Exempt Issuance hereunder.

^^**Warrant Shares**. Simultaneously with any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section, the number of Warrant Shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be increased or decreased proportionately, as applicable, so that after such adjustment the aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder for the increased or decreased, as applicable, number of Warrant Shares shall be the same as the aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

\centered C-5

^^**Fundamental Transaction**. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (A) the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person (other than a transaction effected solely to change the domicile of the Company), (B) the Company effects any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property, (D) consummate a stock purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than the [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock purchase agreement or other business combination) or (E) the Company effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (in any such case, a “***Fundamental Transaction***”), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction upon exercise of this Warrant, the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the “***Alternate Consideration***”) receivable upon or as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a Holder, of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event. For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Company or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall issue to the Holder a new warrant consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder’s right to exercise such warrant into Alternate Consideration. The terms of any agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this **Section 3(d)** and insuring that this Warrant (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a Fundamental Transaction.

^^**Calculations**. All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding.

\centered C-6

^^**Voluntary Adjustment By Company**. The Company may at any time during the term of this Warrant reduce the then current Exercise Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the board of directors of the Company.

^^**Notice to Holders**.  
^^^**Adjustment to Exercise Price**. Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section 3, the Company shall promptly as reasonably possible mail to each Holder a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment. If the Company issues a variable rate security, the Company shall be deemed to have issued Equity Securities at the lowest possible conversion or exercise price at which such securities may be converted or exercised in the case of a Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the following sentence). The term “***Variable Rate Transaction***” shall mean a transaction in which the Company issues or sells (i) any debt or equity securities that are convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or include the right to receive additional shares of Common Stock either (A) at a conversion, exercise or exchange rate or other price that is based upon and/or varies with the trading prices of or quotations for the shares of Common Stock at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity securities, or (B) with a conversion, exercise or exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of the Company or the market for the Common Stock or (ii) enters into any agreement, including, but not limited to, an equity line of credit, whereby the Company may sell securities at a future determined price.

^^^**Notice to Allow Exercise by Holder**. If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on the Common Stock; (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock; (C) the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights; (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, of any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property; (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company; then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least five (5) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange; provided, that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. The Holder is entitled to exercise this Warrant during the 5-day period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering such notice.
