\centered **EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN** 

^**Plan Objectives**. 

      Reward management for achieving stated business objectives

      Build long-term stockholder value

      Provide competitive compensation for senior management

^**Administration**. The Compensation Committee of eHealth, Inc. (the “Company”) will administer the Executive Bonus Plan (the “Plan”). The Compensation Committee reserves the right at any time during the fiscal year to modify the Plan in total or in part. This Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated at any time at the sole and absolute discretion of the Compensation Committee. 

^**Eligibility**. Senior management of the Company as nominated by the CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee, but not including the CEO, (collectively, “Participants”) are eligible to participate in this Plan. Participation in the Plan in one year does not imply continued Plan participation in any subsequent year. Participants must be employed at the time of payment to earn any payment under the Plan. 

Eligible senior management hired during the Plan year will have their Target Incentive Percentage and Maximum Incentive Percentage set by the Compensation Committee (see Item 5 below). Such Participant’s incentive payout will be pro-rated from the first day of employment; provided that the Compensation Committee determines that the Participant is eligible to participate. Employees hired after [[Date 1: Date]] are not eligible for incentive payout for the 2010 Plan year, unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise. 

^**Term**. 12 months, commencing on [[Date 2: Date]] and ending on [[Date 3: Date]]. 

^**Target Incentive Payout**. The Compensation Committee will approve a Target Incentive Percentage and a Maximum Incentive Percentage for each Participant. The incentives under this Plan are expressed as a percentage of annual base salary as of the time the Compensation Committee approves a Participant’s participation in the Plan (the “Annual Salary”). Attached, as Exhibit A, is a schedule of the Annual Salary, Target and Maximum Incentive Percentages and aggregate incentive for each 2010 Plan Participant. The aggregate “Target Incentive Award” for each Participant is equal to that Participant’s Annual Salary multiplied by the Target Incentive Percentage for that Participant. 

^**Incentive Determination**. Company Performance (CP): [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of each Participant’s potential Target Incentive Award is based upon achievement of the 2010 Revenue, Non-GAAP Operating Earnings (without stock compensation) and EBITDA (GAAP Operating Income without stock compensation, depreciation and amortization) performance goals of the Company (each, a “Goal”) as approved by the Compensation Committee in connection with the adoption of this Plan and subject to adjustment as set forth elsewhere in this Plan. The Revenue Goal, the Non-GAAP Operating Earnings Goal and the EBITDA Goal each comprise [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the total potential Target Incentive Award. In order to determine payouts based upon Goal performance achievement between whole percentages, the Compensation Committee shall apply straight-line interpolation. 

***On-Target Performance Payout****.*In the event the Company meets one of the foregoing Goals, a Participant shall receive, in connection with the Company achieving that Goal, [[Percentage 2]]% of the product determined by multiplying the Target Incentive Percentage of the Participant by the Participant’s Annual Salary (a “Goal Target Payout”). 

***Below [[Percentage 3: Number]]% Performance.*** If a Goal is achieved as to less than [[Percentage 3]]%, there will be no payout for that Goal. 

***95-[[Percentage 4: Number]]% Performance Payout.*** If a Goal is achieved at a [[Percentage 3]]% level, a Participant shall receive, in connection with the partial achievement of that Goal, [[Percentage 5: Number]]% of the Goal Target Payout. If a Goal is achieved at the [[Percentage 6: Number]]% level, a Participant shall receive, in connection with the partial achievement of that Goal, [[Percentage 7: Number]]% of the Goal Target Payout. If a Goal is achieved at the [[Percentage 8: Number]]% level, a Participant shall receive, in connection with the partial achievement of that Goal, [[Percentage 9: Number]]% of the Goal Target Payout. If a Goal is achieved at the [[Percentage 10: Number]]% level, a Participant shall receive, in connection with the partial achievement of that Goal, [[Percentage 11: Number]]% of the Goal Target Payout. If a Goal is achieved at the [[Percentage 4]]% level, a Participant shall receive, in connection with the partial achievement of that Goal, [[Percentage 12: Number]]% of the Goal Target Payout. 

***Above [[Percentage 13: Number]]% Performance Payout  2010 Revenue Goal.*** Subject to the other provisions of this Plan, for each percent achieved above [[Percentage 13]]% of the 2010 Revenue Goal, the Participant will receive an additional [[Percentage 14: Number]]% of the Goal Target Payout for the Revenue Goal up to a maximum additional payment equal to [[Percentage 5]]% of the Goal Target Payout. 

***Above [[Percentage 13]]% Performance Payout  2010 Non-GAAP Operating Earnings Goal.*** If and only if the 2010 Revenue Goal is achieved at a level of [[Percentage 13]]% or more, then for each percent achieved above [[Percentage 13]]% of the 2010 Non-GAAP Operating Earnings Goal, the Participant will receive an additional [[Percentage 15: Number]]% of the Goal Target Payout up to a maximum additional Goal Target Payout of [[Percentage 5]]%. 

***Above [[Percentage 13]]% Performance Payout  2010 Non-GAAP EBITDA Goal.*** If and only if the 2010 Revenue Goal is achieved at a level of [[Percentage 13]]% or more, then for each percent achieved above [[Percentage 13]]% of the 2010 EBITDA Goal, the Participant will receive an additional [[Percentage 15]]% of the Goal Target Payout up to a maximum additional Goal Target Payout of [[Percentage 5]]%. 

Individual Performance (IP): In addition to the portion of the Target Incentive Award based upon Company performance, Participants are eligible to earn up to [[Percentage 2]]% of their Target Incentive Award based upon individual performance. In the event of a Participant’s superior performance, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may approve an additional payout to a Participant related to that Participant’s individual performance such that the total incentive paid to the Participant related to the Participant’s individual performance is up to [[Percentage 2]]% of the product determined by multiplying the Maximum Incentive Percentage of the Participant by the Participant’s Annual Salary. The Compensation Committee is not obligated to treat Participants equally with respect to this additional payout and may pay one or more Participants an additional amount and other Participants no additional amount. The Compensation Committee will determine the performance of the Plan participants, with input from the CEO. The determination of individual performance is discretionary. 

The Company must be profitable on an operating basis (excluding non-cash charges) for a Participant to qualify for their maximum payout under the Plan for individual performance or for any specific Goal. If the Company is not profitable on an operating basis (excluding non-cash charges), the maximum possible payout for individual performance or the achievement of any particular Goal shall be no more than [[Percentage 2]]% of the Participant’s Target Incentive Award. 

The 2010 Revenue Goal, Non-GAAP Operating Earnings Goal and EBITDA Goal and performance may exclude, at the Compensation Committee’s sole discretion, (i) the effect of mergers and acquisitions closing in 2010 (if any), (ii) any extraordinary non-recurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 or as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee to be extraordinary or non-recurring in its sole discretion, (iii) the effect of any changes in accounting principles affecting the Company’s or a business units’ reported results, and (iv) any non-recurring expenses specified by the Compensation Committee. 

^**Payment**. Payments under the Plan will be made following the release of the Company’s earnings to the public, but in no event later than [[Date 4: Date]]. The Compensation Committee must approve all executive officer incentive awards prior to payment. All Plan payments will be made net of applicable withholding taxes. 

^**Employment at Will**. The employment of all employees at eHealth is terminable at any time by either party, with or without cause being shown or advance notice by either party. This Plan shall not be construed to create a contract of employment for a specified period of time between eHealth and any employee. 

^**Entire Agreement**. This Plan is the entire agreement between eHealth and the eligible employees regarding the subject matter of this Plan and supersedes all prior bonus compensation or bonus incentive plans or any written or verbal representations regarding the subject matter of this Plan.
