Without limiting the generality of the foregoing covenant of the Company, the Company covenants, for the benefit of the owners of the Bonds, to pay, or cause to be paid, to the Trustee such amounts as shall be necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay the Purchase Price of the Bonds delivered to it for purchase or deemed delivered for purchase, all as more particularly described, in the Indenture; provided, however, that the obligation of the Company to make, or cause to be made, any such payment hereunder shall be satisfied only, in order of priority, first, by funds received by the Paying Agent from the remarketing of the Bonds by the Remarketing Agent, second, in the event sufficient funds are not available from such remarketing, from draws upon the Credit Facility, if any, and third, from funds provided by the Company.

^^The Issuer shall have no obligation or responsibility, financial or otherwise, with respect to the purchase of Bonds or the making or continuation of arrangements therefor other than as expressly set forth in subsection (a) of this Section 4.6, except that the Issuer shall generally cooperate with the Company and the Remarketing Agent as contemplated by the Indenture.

Amounts drawn by the Trustee under any Credit Facility shall be credited against the obligation of the Company to make Loan Payments and Purchase Price Payments hereunder.

^^In the event the Company elects to deliver a Credit Facility, the Company shall notify the Trustee in writing at least forty-five days prior to the expiration of such Credit Facility whether or not the Bank intends to extend such Credit Facility or whether a binding obligation to secure an alternate Credit Facility has been entered into.

^^The Company, the Trustee, and the Bank, with the written consent of the Issuer, may, without the consent of the Bondholders, amend, change, or modify any Credit Facility (i) to cure any ambiguity, formal defect, inconsistency, or minor omission, (ii) to conform to the requirements of the Indenture or the Rating Services, or (iii) if such amendment, change or modification is not prejudicial to the Bondholders in any material respect and the Trustee receives a Favorable Opinion to such effect.

^^**No Arbitrage**. The Company will not use or invest the Proceeds of the Bonds such that the Bonds become "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of section 148 of the Code, and as evidence of this intent, a representative of the Company has reviewed the No-Arbitrage Certificate of the Issuer prepared in connection and delivered concurrently with the Bonds and the Company understands, and will take (or request the Trustee or the Issuer to take), the actions described therein.

^^**Acquisition of Land**. Less than 25 percent of the Net Proceeds of the Bonds actually expended will be used, directly or indirectly, for the acquisition of land or an interest therein. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, no portion of the Net Proceeds of the Bonds will be used, directly or indirectly, for the acquisition of land or an interest therein to be used for farming purposes.

^^**Used Property**. No portion of the Net Proceeds of the Bonds will be used for the acquisition of any existing property or an interest therein unless (i) the first use of such property is pursuant to such acquisition or (ii) the rehabilitation expenditures with respect to any building and equipment therefor equal or exceed 15 percent of the cost of acquiring such building financed with the proceeds of the Bonds (with respect to structures other than buildings, this clause shall be applied by substituting 100 percent for 15 percent). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "rehabilitation expenditures" shall have the meaning set forth in section 147(d)(3) of the Code.

^^**Modification of Requirements**. If at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Issuer, the Trustee or the Company desires to take any action or omit to take any action that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of this Section, such Person shall be permitted to take such action or omit to take such action if it shall first obtain and provide to the other Persons named herein an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that (i) such action or omission shall not adversely affect the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on the Bonds and (ii) such action or omission otherwise is in compliance with the laws of the State and the terms of the Indenture and this Agreement.

The Company will not knowingly take any action, or knowingly omit to take any action, which action or omission will adversely affect the exclusion from gross income of the holders thereof for federal income tax purposes of interest on the Bonds (other than holders who are substantial users of the Project or related persons within the meaning of section 147(a) of the Code), and in the event of such action or omission (whether taken with knowledge or not) will promptly, upon receiving knowledge thereof, take all lawful actions, based on advice of Bond Counsel and at the Company's expense, as may rescind or otherwise negate such action or omission.

SECTION 8.13. **Financial Information**. During such time, if ever, as no Credit Facility is in effect, and the Company does not file annual financial information with the United States Securities Exchange Commission, the Company, shall furnish to the Trustee and any owner, or any beneficial owner, of any Bond who shall have requested the same in writing, as soon as available and in any event within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, financial statements for the Company for the immediately preceding fiscal year, audited by a nationally recognized accounting firm.

The Company shall within fifteen days after the execution thereof, furnish to the Issuer and the Trustee appropriate documentation demonstrating that the surviving, resulting or transferee legal entity, as the case may be, is a domestic legal entity, is qualified to do business in the State, and has assumed in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.

SECTION 10.2. **Remedies**. Upon any acceleration of the principal of the Bonds under the Indenture, all Loan Payments shall be immediately due and payable under this Agreement and the maturity of the Note shall be accelerated. In addition, whenever any Event of Default referred to in Section 10.1 shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee, or the Issuer with the prior written consent of the Trustee, may take any action at law or in equity to collect amounts then due and thereafter to become due, or to enforce performance and observance of any obligation, agreement or covenant of the Company under this Agreement. Any amounts collected pursuant to action taken under this Section 10.2 shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

SECTION 10.3. **No Remedy Exclusive**. No remedy conferred upon or reserved to the Issuer or the Trustee by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other available remedy or remedies, but each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing hereunder shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any other right, power or privilege, but every such right and power may be exercised from time to time and as of ten as may be deemed expedient. In order to entitle the Trustee to exercise any remedy reserved to it in this Article, it shall not be necessary to give any notice other than such notices as may be herein expressly required.

SECTION 10.4. **Agreement to Pay Attorneys' Fees and Expenses**. In the event the Company should default under any of the provisions of this Agreement and the Issuer or the Trustee should employ attorneys or incur other expenses for the collection of the payments due under this Agreement or the enforcement of performance or observance of any obligation or agreement on the part of the Company herein contained, the Company agrees that it will on demand therefor, and upon presentation of an itemized bill, pay to the Issuer or the Trustee the reasonable fees and expenses of such attorneys and such other expenses so incurred by the Issuer or the Trustee.
