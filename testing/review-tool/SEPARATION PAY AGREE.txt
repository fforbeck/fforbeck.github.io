^Notice and Date of Termination  

^^Any termination of the Executive’s employment by the Company or by the Executive shall be communicated by a written notice of termination to the other party (the “Notice of Termination”). Where applicable, the Notice of Termination shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive’s employment under the provision so indicated. Unless the Board determines otherwise, a Notice of Termination by the Executive alleging a termination for Good Reason must be made within 90 days of the initial instance, or the initial instance which should reasonably have been known to the Executive, of an act or failure to act that the Executive alleges to constitute Good Reason. 

^^The date of the Executive’s termination of employment with the Company (the “Date of Termination”) shall be determined as follows: 

3.2.1. If due to Company terminating the Executive’s employment, either with or without Cause, the Date of Termination shall be the date specified in the Notice of Termination; if for other than Cause, the Date of Termination shall not be less than two (2) weeks from the date such Notice of Termination is given, unless the Company elects to pay the Executive for that period in lieu of notice. 

3.2.2. If due to death, the Date of Termination is the date of death. 

3.2.3. If the basis of the Executive’s Involuntary Termination is the Executive’s resignation for Good Reason, the Date of Termination shall be determined by the Company, but shall not be less than two (2) weeks nor more than eight (8) weeks form the date such Notice of Termination is given. 

^Termination from the Board and any Offices Held. Upon termination of the Executive’s employment for any reason, the Executive agrees the Executive’s membership on the Board of the Company, the board of directors of any of the Company’s Affiliates, any committees of the Board, any committees of the board of directors of any of the Company’s Affiliates and any and all offices held, if applicable, shall be automatically terminated. Executive hereby agrees to cooperate with the Company and execute any documents reasonably required by the Company or competent authorities to effect this provision. 

^Severance Benefits upon Involuntary Termination Prior to Change in Control.

^^The total payment will be equal to the product of twelve (12) months (the “Total Number of Months”) multiplied by 1.45 times monthly base pay. Provided, however, if the termination occurs within the first two (2) years of the Executive’s initial employment, the Total Number of Months shall not be less than eighteen (18) months.

The amount of each installment payment described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence will be determined by dividing half of the total payment by [[Percentage 1]]% of the Total Number of Months. The final installment will be equal to the total payment reduced by all the amounts previously paid (i.e., the lump sum payment and the sum of all the installment payments previously paid). Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (ii) to the contrary, if the

six month period would cause the installments to begin to be paid after the [[Date 2]] date described in the first sentence of this section 5.2, then no installments will be paid, and the second payment will be a lump sum equal to half the total payment and that payment will be paid on or before [[Date 2]] of the calendar year following the year in which the Date of Termination occurred. The installment payments (or the second lump sum payment, if applicable) are specifically designated as consideration for execution of the Release required in Section 13 and compliance with Executive’s covenants outlined in Section 13.

5.3.2. Equity Based Compensation. All equity-based Incentive Compensation Awards (including, without limitation, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share awards or other related awards) held by the Executive shall be governed by the terms of the applicable Incentive Compensation Plan and Incentive Compensation Award agreement, and this Agreement shall have no effect upon them.

receive a payment for use in continuation of insurance coverage, such payment to be equal to the annual supplemental executive insurance benefit provided to the Executive prior to the Executive’s Date of Termination. The Company will use its best efforts to make this payment at the time requested. 

5.3.8. Attorney’s Fees in Defense of This Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Company shall pay all reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses for the Executive if the Executive must engage an attorney in order to enforce this Agreement following the Executive’s Date of Termination.

Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (ii) to the contrary, if the six month period would cause the installments to begin to be paid after the [[Date 2]] date described in the first sentence of this section 6.2, then no installments will be paid, and the second payment will be a lump sum equal to half the total payment and that payment will be paid on [[Date 2]] of the calendar year following the year in which the Date of Termination occurred.

If the Executive’s employment shall be terminated for Cause, or if the Executive terminates employment other than for Good Reason, the Company will have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement other than the Pre-Change in Control Accrued Obligations and any amounts described in Section 10 hereof.

^Severance Benefits upon Termination due to Death. If the Executive’s employment shall terminate by reason of death, the Company shall pay the Executive’s estate the Post-Change in Control Accrued Obligations and any amounts or benefits described in Section 10 herein. Such payments shall be in addition to those rights and benefits to which the Executive’s estate may be entitled under the relevant Company plans or programs. 

^Adjustments to Maximize After-Tax Benefits. In the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company or its Affiliates to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9 ( a “Payment”) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Excise Tax”) , then the Executive’s Unreduced and Reduced Net Benefit shall be determined and the Payments shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 9.3. 

^^For purposes of Section 9.3 the Unreduced Net Benefit shall equal the Payments, less the amount of federal, state and local income and other taxes (including the excise tax under Code Section 4999) payable with respect to such benefits. For these purposes, the federal, state, local and any other taxes shall be calculated at the maximum marginal income tax rates applicable to such Executive for each year in which the foregoing amounts shall be paid. 

9.2.For purposes of Section 9.3 the Reduced Net Benefit shall equal the amount determined under Section 9.1 but with the Payments first reduced by an amount such that the present value of all payments and benefits that the Executive receives or is entitled to receive from the Company that would constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Code Section 280G does not exceed 2.99 times the Executive’s “base amount,” as defined under Code Section 280G. For purposes of calculating the aggregate present value of such parachute payments, the requirements of Code Section 280G shall be followed. 

^^If the Executive’s Reduced Net Benefit is greater than the Unreduced Net Benefit, then the amount of the Payments set forth in Section 9.2 of the Agreement shall be reduced to an aggregate present value amount that does not subject any of the payments to taxation under Code Section 4999. 

^^A nationally recognized accounting firm as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Executive (the “Accounting Firm”) shall perform any and all calculations required under Code Section 280G, and shall determine the Executive’s Reduced and Unreduced Net Benefit. Such determination shall be made within ten (10) business days of the date of a change in control or ownership as determined under Code Section 280G and such determinations shall be binding on the Company and the Executive. In the event a reduction of the Payments is to be made pursuant to Section 9.3, the Executive shall have discretion to determine which and how much of the Payments shall be eliminated or reduced consistent with the requirements of Section 9.3 and in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A. The Executive shall make such decision no later than five (5) business days following the determination by the independent accounting firm of the Executive’s Reduced and Unreduced Net Benefit. 

^Nonexclusivity of Rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive’s continuing or future participation in any benefit plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company and for which the Executive may qualify (except with respect to any benefit to which the Executive has waived the Executive’s rights in writing), including, without limitation, any and all indemnification arrangements in favor of the Executive (whether under agreements or under the Company’s charter documents or otherwise), and insurance policies covering the Executive, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any other contract or agreement entered into after the Effective Date with the Company. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the

Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any benefit, plan, policy, practice or program of, or any contract or agreement entered into with, the Company shall be payable in accordance with such benefit, plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement. At all times during the Executive’s employment with the Company and thereafter, the Company shall provide the Executive with indemnification and director and officer insurance insuring the Executive against insurable events which occur or have occurred while the Executive was a director or executive officer of the Company, on terms and conditions that are at least as generous as that then provided to any other current or former director or executive officer of the Company or any Affiliate. 

^Full Settlement; Mitigation. The Company’s obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform the obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others, provided that nothing herein shall preclude the Company from separately pursuing recovery from the Executive based on any such claim. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts (including amounts for damages for breach) payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement, and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment. 

^Representations. The Executive hereby represents to the Company that the Executive is legally entitled to enter into this Agreement and to perform the Executive’s obligations hereunder, and that the Executive has the full right, power and authority, subject to no rights of any third parties, to grant to the Company the rights contemplated in Section 13.2.

In view of the nature of the Executive’s employment with the Company, the Executive likewise agrees that the Company and its Affiliates would be irreparably harmed by any such solicitation or recruitment in violation of the terms of this paragraph and that the Company and its Affiliates shall therefore be entitled to preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the Executive from engaging in any activity or threatened activity in violation of the terms of this paragraph and to any other relief available to them.

such interference or competitive actions in violation of the terms of this paragraph and that the Company and its Affiliates shall therefore be entitled to preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the Executive from engaging in any activity or threatened activity in violation of the terms of this paragraph and to any other relief available to them. 

^^Release.

^Specific Remedies for Executive Breach of the Covenants as outlined in Section 13. Without limiting the rights and remedies available to the Company, and notwithstanding the rights of the Executive set forth in Section 11, in the event of any breach by the Executive of the covenants set forth in Section 13 above, the following actions may be taken by the Company: 

^^if the Company believes a breach has occurred, it will deliver to the Executive a summary of the breach and a demand for explanation or agreement that such breach has occurred; the Executive shall have twenty (20) business days to respond in writing to this demand, whereupon the Company will make a decision as to whether the breach has, in fact, occurred; if it is determined such a breach has occurred, then 

^^the Company’s obligation to make any payment or provide any benefits to the Executive under Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 of this Agreement shall cease immediately and permanently, which shall not have any impact whatsoever on the Executive’s continuing obligations under Sections 14.3 and 14.4 below, except, however, the benefits outlined in Sections 5.3.8 and 6.3.8 will continue to be provided; 

^^the Executive shall repay to the Company, within ten (10) days after the Executive receives written demand therefore, an amount equal to ninety percent ([[Percentage 4: Number]]%) of the payments and benefits previously received by the Executive under this Agreement, plus interest on such amount at an annual rate equal to the lesser of ten percent ([[Percentage 5: Number]]%) or the maximum non-usurious rate under applicable law, from the dates on which such payments and benefits were received to the date of repayment to the Company; and 

^^the Executive shall pay to the Company from time to time, within ten (10) days after the Executive receives written demand therefore, an amount or amounts equal to the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses) incurred by or on behalf of the Company in enforcing this Section 14 from and after the date on which the Company delivers notice of such breach to the Executive.

^^It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Section 14 be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the applicable laws in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any portion of this Section 14 is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, this Section 14 shall be deemed curtailed, whether as to time or location, to the minimum extent required for its validity under applicable law and shall be binding and enforceable with respect to the Executive as so curtailed, such curtailment to apply only with respect to the operation of this Section 14 in the jurisdiction in which the such adjudication is made. If a court in any jurisdiction, in adjudicating the validity of this Section 14, imposes any additional terms or restrictions with respect to this Section 14, this Section 14 shall be deemed amended to incorporate such additional terms or restrictions. 

^^Executive agrees and acknowledges that Executive has received good and adequate consideration for the covenants set forth in this Section 14 in the form of employment, compensation and benefits separate and independent of any payments or potential payments in this Agreement. 

^Potential Impact of Accounting Restatements on Certain Bonuses and Profits. 

^^If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations affecting any reporting period that transpires during the term of this Agreement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial requirements under the securities laws, the Company’s Board will be entitled to determine whether the noncompliance was the result of knowing, intentional, fraudulent or illegal conduct by the Executive, and if it so determines, to require the Executive to reimburse the Company for (i) any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received by the Executive from the Company during the term of this Agreement and (ii) any profits realized from the sale of securities of the issuer by the Executive during the term of this Agreement. 

^^In making the determination whether to seek reimbursement from Executive, the Board will consider whether any bonus, incentive payment, equity award, or other compensation has been awarded or received by the Executive during the term of this Agreement and whether such compensation was based on any financial results or operating metrics that were satisfied as a result of the Executive’s knowing, intentional, fraudulent or illegal conduct. The Board has sole discretion in determining whether the Executive’s conduct has or has not met the standard of such forfeiture. 

^^If the Board determines that a forfeiture is appropriate, such amounts shall be withheld from any future amounts owed to the Executive as compensation. The Company may commence legal action to collect such sums as the Board determines is owed to the Company. 

^Successors.  

^^Assignment by the Executive. This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

As used in this Agreement, “Company” shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor

to its business and/or assets as aforesaid that assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise. 

^Administration Prior to Change in Control. Prior to a Change in Control, the Compensation Committee shall have full and complete authority to construe and interpret the provisions of this Agreement, to determine an individual’s entitlement to benefits under this Agreement, to make in its sole and absolute discretion all determinations contemplated under this Agreement, to investigate and make factual determinations necessary or advisable to administer or implement this Agreement.

Prior to a Change in Control, the Compensation Committee may delegate responsibilities for the operation and administration of this Agreement to one or more officers or employees of the Company. The provisions of this Section 17 shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the occurrence of a Change in Control. 

^Delayed Commencement of Certain Payments.

Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Executive is a “specified employee” within the contemplation of Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code at the time that any payment that is subject to Section 409A of the Code is made on account of the Executive’s Involuntary Termination the Executive’s separation from service with the Company and its Affiliates within the contemplation of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code), then in no event shall such payment or the commencement thereof be made before the six-month anniversary of the Date of Termination or, if earlier, the date of the Executive’s post-separation death. 

^^Any reimbursement payment made under this Agreement that is considered non-qualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall be made within the timing requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(iv).

however, that no detailed information concerning the Executive’s physical examination will be provided to the Company or made available to the Company by the insurance company. 

^^Waiver of Breach. A waiver by the Company or the Executive of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the other party.

**THIS MUTUAL RELEASE AGREEMENT** (“Release”) dated as of (the “Effective Date”) is made by and between WRIGHT MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, INC., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware with its principal place of business at [[Address 1: Address]] (the “Company”), and EDWARD A.

Company does hereby declare that the Company does understand, covenant, and agree that the Company will not make any claims or demands, or file any legal proceedings against Executive or join Executive as a party to any claim, demand, or legal proceedings nor shall Company proceed against any other party, person, firm, or corporation on the claims described above except as is necessary in order to enforce the terms and conditions of this Release and the Separation Pay Agreement. 

THE FILING OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, BY THE COMPANY, AGAINST EXECUTIVE, SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A MATERIAL BREACH OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

ADDITIONALLY, COMPANY SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS EXECUTIVE FROM ANY AND ALL JUDGMENTS, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR ATTORNEY FEES WHATSOEVER ARISING ON ACCOUNT OF THE FILING OF ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BY THE COMPANY. 

It is further understood and agreed that the acceptance of the consideration more fully described in the Separation Pay Agreement between the parties is in full accord and satisfaction of any obligations, claims, and/or disputes that Company may have with Executive. 

It is further understood and agreed that this is the full and complete understanding of the parties, that it is the integrated memorial of their agreement and that there are no other written or oral understandings, agreements, covenants, promises, or arrangements, directly or indirectly connected with this release, that are not incorporated herein. The terms of this release are contractual and are not mere recitals.
