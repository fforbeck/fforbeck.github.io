\centered **RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AGREEMENT**

DTS, Inc.has granted to the Awardee named in the *Notice of Grant of Restricted Stock Units* (the “**Grant** **Notice**”) to which this Restricted Stock Units Agreement (the “**Agreement**”) is attached an Award consisting of Restricted Stock Units (the “**Units**”) subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice and this Agreement. The Award has been granted pursuant to and shall in all respects be subject to the terms conditions of the DTS, Inc. 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the “**Plan**”), as amended to the Grant Date attached as Exhibit A, the provisions of which are incorporated herein by reference. By signing the Grant Notice, the Awardee: (a) acknowledges receipt of and represents that the Awardee has read and is familiar with the Grant Notice, this Agreement, the Plan and a prospectus for the Plan prepared in connection with the registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the shares issuable pursuant to the Award (the “**Plan Prospectus**”), (b) accepts the Award subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan and (c) agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Committee upon any questions arising under the Grant Notice, this Agreement or the Plan.

^**Definitions and Construction****.**

^^**Definitions*.*** Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned in the Grant Notice or the Plan.

^^**Construction*.*** Captions and titles contained herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. Except when otherwise indicated by the context, the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular. Use of the term “or” is not intended to be exclusive, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

^**Administration****.**

All questions of interpretation concerning the Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan shall be determined by the Committee or its designee. All such determinations shall be final and binding upon all persons having an interest in the Award as provided by the Plan. Any Officer shall have the authority to act on behalf of the Company with respect to any matter, right, obligation, or election which is the responsibility of or which is allocated to the Company herein, provided the Officer has apparent or actual authority with respect to such matter, right, obligation, or election.

^**The Award****.**

^^**Grant of Units.** On the Grant Date, the Awardee shall acquire, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Number of Restricted Stock Units set forth in the Grant Notice, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 0. Each Unit represents a right to receive on a date determined in accordance with the Grant Notice and this Agreement one (1) Share.

^^**No Monetary Payment Required.** The Awardee is not required to make any monetary payment (other than applicable tax withholding, if any) as a condition to receiving the Units or Shares issued upon settlement of the Units, the consideration for which shall be past services actually rendered and/or future services to be rendered to the Company or an Affiliate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if required by applicable state corporate law, the Awardee shall furnish consideration in the form of cash or past services rendered having a value not less than the par value of the Shares issued upon settlement of the Units.

^**Vesting of Units****.**

**Normal Vesting.** The Units shall vest and become Vested Units as provided in the Grant Notice. In the event that a Vesting Date as provided by the Grant Notice (an “**Original Settlement Date**”) would occur on a date on which a sale by the Awardee of the shares to be issued in settlement of the Units becoming Vested Units on such Original Settlement Date would violate the Insider Trading Policy of the Company, the Settlement of such Vested Units shall be deferred until the first to occur of (a) the next business day on which a sale by the Awardee of such shares would not violate the Insider Trading Policy or (b) the later of (i) the last day of the calendar year in which the Original Vesting Date occurred or (ii) the last day of the Company’s taxable year in which the Original Vesting Date occurred.

^**Company Reacquisition Right****.**

^^**Grant of Company Reacquisition Right.** Except to the extent otherwise provided in an employment agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Awardee, in the event that the Awardee’s Service terminates for any reason or no reason, with or without cause, the Awardee shall forfeit and the Company shall automatically reacquire all Units which are not, as of the time of such termination, Vested Units (***“Unvested Units”**)*, and the Awardee shall not be entitled to any payment therefor (the *“Company Reacquisition Right”***).

^^**Dividends, Distributions and Adjustments*.*** Upon a dividend or distribution to the stockholders of the Company paid in shares of Stock or other property, or any other adjustment upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 10.2 of the Plan, any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than regular, periodic dividends paid on Shares pursuant to the Company’s dividend policy) to which the Awardee is entitled by reason of the Awardee’s ownership of Unvested Units shall be immediately subject to the Company Reacquisition Right and included in the terms “Units” and “Unvested Units” for all purposes of the Company Reacquisition Right with the same force and effect as the Unvested Units immediately prior to the dividend, distribution or adjustment, as the case may be. For purposes of determining the number of Vested Units following a dividend, distribution or adjustment, credited Service shall include all service with the Company or an Affiliate at the time the service is rendered.

^**Settlement of the Award****.**

^^**Issuance of Shares*.*** Subject to the provisions of Section 0 below, the Company shall issue to the Awardee on the settlement date with respect to each Vested Unit to be settled on such date one (1) Share. Shares issued in settlement of Units shall not be subject to any restriction on transfer other than any such restriction as may be required pursuant to Section 0, Section 7 or the Company’s Insider Trading Policy.

^^**Beneficial Ownership of Shares; Certificate Registration*.*** The Awardee hereby authorizes the Company, in its sole discretion, to deposit for the benefit of the Awardee with the broker designated by the Company with which the Awardee has an account, any or all Shares acquired by the Awardee pursuant to the settlement of the Award. Except as provided by the preceding sentence, a certificate for the Shares as to which the Award is settled shall be registered in the name of the Awardee, or, if applicable, in the names of the heirs of the Awardee.

^^**Restrictions on Grant of the Award and Issuance of Shares*.*** The grant of the Award and issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Award shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities. No Shares may be issued hereunder if the issuance of such Shares would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Shares may then be listed. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any shares subject to the Award shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the settlement of the Award, the Company may require the Awardee to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

^^**Fractional Shares*.*** The Company shall not be required to issue fractional Shares upon the settlement of the Award.

^**Tax Withholding****.**

^^**In General.** At the time the Grant Notice is executed, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Awardee hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Awardee, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for, any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax (including any social insurance) withholding obligations of the Company and its Affiliates, if any, which arise in connection with the Award, the vesting of Units or the issuance of Shares in settlement thereof. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock until such tax withholding obligations of the Company have been satisfied by the Awardee.

^^**Assignment of Sale Proceeds; Payment of Tax Withholding by Check.** Subject to compliance with applicable law and the Company’s Insider Trading Policy, the Company may permit the Awardee to satisfy the tax withholding obligations in accordance with procedures established by the Company providing for either (i) delivery by the Awardee to the Company or a broker approved by the Company of properly executed instructions, in a form approved by the Company, providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale with respect to some or all of the Shares being acquired upon settlement of Units, or (ii) payment by check.

^^**Withholding in Shares.** The Company may require the Awardee to satisfy all or any portion of the Company’s or Affiliate’s tax withholding obligations by deducting from the Shares otherwise deliverable to the Awardee in settlement of the Award a number of whole Shares having a fair market value, as determined by the Company as of the date on which the tax withholding obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such tax withholding obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates.

^^**Default Withholding Provision.** Except as otherwise provided by the Company, if the Awardee does not deliver to the Company at least five (5) days prior to a Settlement Date a written notice of Awardee’s election to satisfy by cash, check, or other manner agreeable to the Company, all federal, state, local or foreign tax withholding obligations related to such Shares, Awardee and the Company agree that the Company shall retain that number of the Shares, based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on such Settlement Date, with an aggregate value equal to the amount of all federal, state, local or foreign tax withholding obligations that Awardee, the Company, or an Affiliate would incur as a result of the Settlement of such Shares.

^**Effect of Fundamental Transaction on Award*****.***

In the event of a Fundamental Transaction, except to the extent that the Committee determines to cash out the Award, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the “***Acquiror***”), may, without the consent of the Awardee, assume or continue the Company’s rights and obligations with respect to all or any portion of the outstanding Units or substitute for all or any portion of the outstanding Units substantially equivalent rights with respect to the Acquiror’s stock. For purposes of this Section, a Unit shall be deemed assumed if, following the Fundamental Transaction, the Unit confers the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, the consideration (whether stock, cash, other securities or property or a combination thereof) to which a holder of a Share on the effective date of the Change in Control was entitled; provided, however, that if such consideration is not solely common stock of the Acquiror, the Committee may, with the consent of the Acquiror, provide for the consideration to be received upon settlement of the Unit to consist solely of common stock of the Acquiror equal in Fair Market Value to the per share consideration received by holders of Share pursuant to the Fundamental Transaction.

^**Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure****.**

Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company and the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to the extent applicable, in the event of any change in the Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of payment of a dividend or distribution to the stockholders of the Company in a form other than Shares (excepting normal cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of Shares, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made in the number of Units subject to the Award and/or the number and kind of shares to be issued in settlement of the Award, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the Awardee’s rights under the Award. For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as “effected without receipt of consideration by the Company.” Any fractional Share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Such adjustments shall be determined by the Committee, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.

^**Rights as a Stockholder or Employee****.**

The Awardee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares which may be issued in settlement of this Award until the date of the issuance of a certificate for such Shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 0. If the Awardee is an Employee, the Awardee understands and acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in a separate, written employment agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Awardee, the Awardee’s employment is “at will” and is for no specified term. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the Awardee any right to continue in the service of the Company or an Affiliate or interfere in any way with any right to terminate the Awardee’s service at any time.

^**Legends****.**

The Company may at any time place legends referencing any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law restrictions on all certificates representing Shares issued pursuant to this Agreement. The Awardee shall, at the request 

of the Company, promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing Shares acquired pursuant to this Award in the possession of the Awardee in order to carry out the provisions of this Section.

^**Miscellaneous Provisions****.**

^^**Termination or Amendment.** The Committee may terminate or amend the Plan or this Agreement at any time; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 8 in connection with a Fundamental Transaction, no such termination or amendment may adversely affect the Awardee’s rights under this Agreement without the consent of the Awardee unless such termination or amendment is necessary to comply with applicable law or government regulation, including, but not limited to, Section 409A. No amendment or addition to this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing.

^^**Nontransferability of the Award.** Prior to the issuance of Shares on the applicable Settlement Date, neither this Award nor any Units subject to this Award shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Awardee or the Awardee’s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to the Award shall be exercisable during the Awardee’s lifetime only by the Awardee or the Awardee’s guardian or legal representative.

^^**Further Instruments.** The parties hereto agree to execute such further instruments and to take such further action as may reasonably be necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement.
