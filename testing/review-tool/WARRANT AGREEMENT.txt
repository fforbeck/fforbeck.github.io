In the event the person whose facsimile signature has been placed upon any Warrant shall have ceased to serve in the capacity in which such person signed the Warrant before such Warrant is issued, it may be issued with the same effect as if he or she had not ceased to be such at the date of issuance.

^^**Registration**.  
2.3.1. **Warrant Register**. The Warrant Agent shall maintain books (“Warrant Register”), for the registration of original issuance and the registration of transfer of the Warrants. Upon the initial issuance of the Warrants, the Warrant Agent shall issue and register the Warrants in the names of the respective holders thereof in such denominations and otherwise in accordance with instructions delivered to the Warrant Agent by the Company.

2.3.2. **Registered Holder**. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of any Warrant, the Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name such Warrant shall be registered upon the Warrant Register (“registered holder”) as the absolute owner of such Warrant and of each Warrant represented thereby (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing on the Warrant Certificate made by anyone other than the Company or the Warrant Agent), for the purpose of any exercise thereof, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

^^**Detachability of Warrants**. The securities comprising the Units will begin to trade separately on the date that is the fifth business day following the 45th calendar day following the date of the prospectus pursuant to which the Units are sold (the “Detachment Date”), or earlier with the consent of Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc., the representative of the underwriters (“Representative” or “MJ”) but in no event before: (i) the expiration of the over-allotment option (the “Over-allotment Option”) granted to MJ, (ii) its exercise in full, or (iii) or MJ’s notice to the Company of its intention not to exercise all or any remaining portion of the Over-allotment Option, provided that in no event will separate trading of the securities comprising the Units commence until (x) the Company files with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K, which includes an audited balance sheet reflecting the receipt by the Company of the gross proceeds of the sale of the Private Warrants and the Public Offering, including the proceeds received by the Company from the exercise of the Over-allotment Option, if the Over-allotment Option is exercised prior to the filing of the Form 8-K and (y) the Company issues a press release and files with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing when such separate trading will begin.

^^**Warrant Attributes**.  
2.5.1 **Insider Warrants**. The Insider Warrants will be issued in the same form as the Public Warrants but they (i) will not be transferable or salable until 30 days after the Company completes a business transaction, (ii) will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Insiders or their affiliates, (iii) will not be redeemable by the Company so long as they are held by the Insiders or their affiliates and (iv) may be exercised for unregistered shares if a registration statement relating to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is not effective and current, subject to Section 3.3.2 (ii) herein.

^**Terms and Exercise of Warrants**  
^^**Warrant Price**. Each Warrant shall, when countersigned by the Warrant Agent, entitle the registered holder thereof, subject to the provisions of such Warrant and of this Warrant Agreement, to purchase from the Company the number of shares of Common Stock stated therein, at the price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to the adjustments provided in Section 4 hereof and in the last sentence of this Section 3.1. The term “Warrant Price” as used in this Warrant Agreement refers to the price per share at which shares of Common Stock may be purchased at the time a Warrant is exercised. The Company in its sole discretion may lower the Warrant Price at any time prior to the Expiration Date for a period of not less than twenty business days, provided that any such reduction shall be identical among all of the Warrants.

^^**Duration of Warrants**. A Warrant may be exercised only during the period commencing on the later of: (i) 30 days following the consummation by the Company of a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses (as described more fully in the Registration Statement, “**Business Transaction**”), or (ii) [ ], 2011 (one year from the effective date of the Registration Statement), and terminating at 5:00 p.m., [[Address 3: Address]] on the earlier to occur of (x) five years from the effective date of the Business Transaction; (ii) upon the liquidation of the Company ; or (iii) the Redemption Date as provided in Section 6.2 of this Agreement (“Expiration Date”). Except with respect to the right to receive the Redemption Price (as set forth in Section 6 hereunder), each Warrant not exercised on or before the Expiration Date shall become void, and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect thereof under this Agreement shall cease at the close of business on the Expiration Date. The Company in its sole discretion may extend the duration of the Warrants by delaying the Expiration Date; provided, however, the Company will provide notice to registered holders of the Warrants of such extension of not less than 20 days and, further provided that any such extension shall be identical in duration among all of the Warrants.

^^**Exercise of Warrants**.  
3.3.1. **Payment**. Subject to the provisions of the Warrant and this Warrant Agreement, a Warrant, when countersigned by the Warrant Agent, may be exercised by the registered holder thereof by surrendering it, at the office of the Warrant Agent, or at the office of its successor as Warrant Agent, in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of [[Address 4: Address]] subscription form, as set forth in the Warrant, duly executed, and by paying in full the Warrant Price for each full share of Common Stock as to which the Warrant is exercised and any and all applicable taxes due in connection with the exercise of the Warrant, the exchange of the Warrant for the shares of Common Stock and the issuance of such Common Stock, as follows:

^^in lawful money of the United States, in cash, good certified check or good bank draft payable to the order of the Company;

^^in the event of redemption pursuant to Section 6 hereof in which the Company’s management has elected to force all holders of Warrants to exercise such Warrants on a “cashless basis,” by surrendering the Warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares Common Stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the Warrant Price and the “Fair Market Value” (defined below) by (y) the Fair Market Value. Solely for purposes of this Section 3.3.1(b), the “Fair Market Value” shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Common Stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to holders of Warrant pursuant to Section 6 hereof; or

^^with respect to any Insider Warrants, so long as such Insider Warrants are held by the Insiders or their affiliates, by surrendering the Warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the Warrant Price and the “Fair Market Value” (defined below) by (y) the Fair Market Value. Solely for purposes of this Section 3.3.1(c), the “Fair Market Value” shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Common Stock for the 5 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date of exercise.

3.3.2. **Issuance of Certificates**. As soon as practicable after the exercise of any Warrant and the clearance of the funds in payment of the Warrant Price (if cash is paid), the Company shall issue to the registered holder of such Warrant a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of shares of Common Stock to which he, she or it is entitled, registered in such name or names as may be directed by him, her or it, and if such Warrant shall not have been exercised in full, a new countersigned Warrant for the number of shares as to which such Warrant shall not have been exercised. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any securities pursuant to the exercise of a Warrant and shall have no obligation to settle such Warrant exercise unless: (i) a registration statement under the Act with respect to the shares of Common Stock is effective, subject to the Company’s satisfying its obligations under Section 7.4 or (ii) solely with respect to Insider Warrants, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, the exercise of the Insider Warrants is exempt from the registration requirements of the Act and such securities are qualified for sale or exempt from qualification under applicable securities laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which the registered holders reside. In the event that the conditions in clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence are not satisfied with respect to a Warrant and, if such Warrant is an Insider Warrant, the conditions in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence are not satisfied, the holder of such Warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such Warrant and such Warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Warrant exercise. Warrants may not be exercised by, or securities issued to, any registered holder in any state in which such exercise would be unlawful. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised Public Warrants the purchaser of a Unit containing such Warrants will have paid the full purchase price for the Unit solely for the shares of Common Stock included in such Unit.

3.3.3. **Valid Issuance**. All shares of Common Stock issued upon the proper exercise of a Warrant in conformity with this Agreement shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

3.3.4. **Date of Issuance**. Each person in whose name any such certificate for Common Stock is issued shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares on the date on which the Warrant was surrendered and payment of the Warrant Price was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such certificate, except that, if the date of such surrender and payment is a date when the share transfer books of the Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the holder of such shares at the close of business on the next succeeding date on which the share transfer books are open.

^**Adjustments**.  
^^**Stock Dividends - Split Ups**. If after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions of Section 4.6 below, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, or by a split up of shares of Common Stock, or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split up or similar event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be increased in proportion to such increase in outstanding shares of Common Stock.

^^**Aggregation of Shares**. If after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions of Section 4.6, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of shares of Common Stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of Common Stock.

^^**Adjustments in Exercise Price**. Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants is adjusted, as provided in Section 4.1 and 4.2 above, the Warrant Price shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) by multiplying such Warrant Price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock so purchasable immediately thereafter.

^^**Replacement of Securities upon Reorganization, etc**. In case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change covered by Section 4.1 or 4.2 hereof or that solely affects the par value of such shares of Common Stock), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Common Stock), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which the Company is dissolved, the Warrant holders shall thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the Warrants and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock of the Company immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the Warrant holder would have received if such Warrant holder had exercised his, her or its Warrant(s) immediately prior to such event; provided, that (i) if the holders of Common Stock were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets for which each Warrant shall become exercisable shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by the holders of Common Stock in such consolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election or (ii) if a tender or exchange offer shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of Common Stock under circumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer, the maker thereof, together with members of any group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act) of which such maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) more than [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the holder of a Warrant shall be entitled to receive the highest amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a shareholder if such Warrant holder had exercised the Warrant prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of the Common Stock held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, subject to adjustments (from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in this Section 4. If any reclassification or reorganization also results in a change in shares of Common Stock covered by Section 4.1 or 4.2, then such adjustment shall be made pursuant to Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and this Section 4.4. The provisions of this Section 4.4 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, reorganizations, mergers or consolidations, sales or other transfers.

^^**Notices of Changes in Warrant**. Upon every adjustment of the Warrant Price or the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant, the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Warrant Agent, which notice shall state the Warrant Price resulting from such adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares purchasable at such price upon the exercise of a Warrant, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. Upon the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4, then, in any such event, the Company shall give written notice to each Warrant holder, at the last address set forth for such holder in the warrant register, of the record date or the effective date of the event. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such event.

^^**No Fractional Shares**. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Warrant Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not issue fractional shares upon exercise of Warrants. If, by reason of any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4, the holder of any Warrant would be entitled, upon the exercise of such Warrant, to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Company shall, upon such exercise, round up to the nearest whole number, the number of the shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Warrant holder.

^^**Form of Warrant**. The form of Warrant need not be changed because of any adjustment pursuant to this Section 4, and Warrants issued after such adjustment may state the same Warrant Price and the same number of shares as is stated in the Warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement. However, the Company may at any time in its sole discretion make any change in the form of Warrant that the Company may deem appropriate and that does not affect the substance thereof, and any Warrant thereafter issued or countersigned, whether in exchange or substitution for an outstanding Warrant or otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.

^**Transfer and Exchange of Warrants**.  
^^**Registration of Transfer**. The Warrant Agent shall register the transfer, from time to time, of any outstanding Warrant upon the Warrant Register, upon surrender of such Warrant for transfer, properly endorsed with signatures properly guaranteed and accompanied by appropriate instructions for transfer. Upon any such transfer, a new Warrant representing an equal aggregate number of Warrants shall be issued and the old Warrant shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent. The Warrants so cancelled shall be delivered by the Warrant Agent to the Company from time to time upon request.

^^**Procedure for Surrender of Warrants**. Warrants may be surrendered to the Warrant Agent, together with a written request for exchange or transfer, and thereupon the Warrant Agent shall issue in exchange therefor one or more new Warrants as requested by the registered holder of the Warrants so surrendered, representing an equal aggregate number of Warrants; provided, however, that in the event that a Warrant surrendered for transfer bears a restrictive legend, the Warrant Agent shall not cancel such Warrant and issue new Warrants in exchange therefor until the Warrant Agent has received an opinion of counsel for the Company stating that such transfer may be made and indicating whether the new Warrants must also bear a restrictive legend.

^^**Fractional Warrants**. The Warrant Agent shall not be required to effect any registration of transfer or exchange which will result in the issuance of a warrant certificate for a fraction of a warrant.

^^**Service Charges**. No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Warrants.

^^**Warrant Execution and Countersignature**. The Warrant Agent is hereby authorized to countersign and to deliver, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Warrants required to be issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5, and the Company, whenever required by the Warrant Agent, will supply the Warrant Agent with Warrants duly executed on behalf of the Company for such purpose.

^^**Transfer of Warrants**. Prior to the Detachment Date, the Public Warrants may be transferred or exchanged only together with the Unit in which such Warrant is included, and only for the purpose of effecting, or in conjunction with, a transfer or exchange of such Unit. Furthermore, each transfer of a Unit on the register relating to such Units shall operate also to transfer the Warrants included in such Unit. From and after the Detachment Date this Section 5.6 will have no further force and effect.

^**Redemption**.  
^^**Redemption**. Subject to Sections 6.4 and 6.5 hereof, not less than all of the outstanding Warrants may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, at any time while they are exercisable and prior to their expiration, at the office of the Warrant Agent, upon the notice referred to in Section 6.2, at the price of $.01 per Warrant (“Redemption Price”), provided that the last sales price of the Common Stock has been at least $17.50 per share (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 4 hereof), on each of twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is given. The provisions of this Section 6.1 may not be modified, amended or deleted without the prior written consent of MJ.

^^**Date Fixed for, and Notice of, Redemption**. In the event the Company shall elect to redeem all of the Warrants, the Company shall fix a date for the redemption (the “Redemption Date”). Notice of redemption shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, by the Company not less than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date to the registered holders of the Warrants to be redeemed at their last addresses as they shall appear on the registration books. Any notice mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the registered holder received such notice.

^^**Exercise After Notice of Redemption**. The Warrants may be exercised, for cash (or on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement) at any time after notice of redemption shall have been given by the Company pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof and prior to the Redemption Date. In the event the Company determines to require all holders of Warrants to exercise their Warrants on a “cashless basis” pursuant to Section 3, the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of shares Common Stock to be received upon exercise of the Warrants, including the “Fair Market Value” in such case. On and after the Redemption Date, the record holder of the Warrants shall have no further rights except to receive, upon surrender of the Warrants, the Redemption Price.

^^**Exclusion of Insider Warrants**. The Company understands that the redemption rights provided for by this Section 6 do not apply to the Insider Warrants if at the time of redemption such warrants continue to be held by the initial purchasers thereof or their permitted assigns. However, once such Insider Warrants are transferred other than to any permitted assign, the Company may redeem the Insider Warrants, provided that the criteria for redemption are met, including the opportunity of the Warrant holder to exercise prior to redemption pursuant to Section 6.3.

^**Other Provisions Relating to Rights of Holders of Warrants**.

^^**No Rights as Stockholder**. A Warrant does not entitle the registered holder thereof to any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to receive dividends, or other distributions, exercise any preemptive rights to vote or to consent or to receive notice as stockholders in respect of the meetings of stockholders or the election of directors of the Company or any other matter.

^^**Lost, Stolen, Mutilated, or Destroyed Warrants**. If any Warrant is lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, the Company and the Warrant Agent may on such terms as to indemnity or otherwise as they may in their discretion impose (which shall, in the case of a mutilated Warrant, include the surrender thereof), issue a new Warrant of like denomination, tenor, and date as the Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed. Any such new Warrant shall constitute a substitute contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed Warrant shall be at any time enforceable by anyone.

^^**Reservation of Common Stock**. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available a number of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Warrants issued pursuant to this Agreement.

^^**Registration of Common Stock**. The Company agrees that prior to the commencement of the Exercise Period, it shall use its best efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, or a new registration statement, for the registration, under the Act, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, and it shall use its best efforts to take such action as is necessary to qualify for sale, in those states in which the Warrants were initially offered by the Company, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants. In either case, the Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement until the expiration of the Warrants in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Company agrees to use its best efforts to register such securities under the blue sky laws of the states of residence of the exercising warrant holders to the extent an exemption is not available , subject to the proviso above. The provisions of this Section 7.4 may not be modified, amended or deleted without the prior written consent of MJ.

^**Concerning the Warrant Agent and Other Matters**.

^^**Payment of Taxes**. The Company will from time to time promptly pay all taxes and charges that may be imposed upon the Company or the Warrant Agent in respect of the issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of Warrants, but the Company shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes in respect of the Warrants or such shares.

^^**Resignation, Consolidation, or Merger of Warrant Agent**.

8.2.1. **Appointment of Successor Warrant Agent**. The Warrant Agent, or any successor to it hereafter appointed, may resign its duties and be discharged from all further duties and liabilities hereunder after giving sixty (60) days’ notice in writing to the Company. If the office of the Warrant Agent becomes vacant by resignation or incapacity to act or otherwise, the Company shall appoint in writing a successor Warrant Agent in place of the Warrant Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the Warrant Agent or by the holder of the Warrant (who shall, with such notice, submit his Warrant for inspection by the Company), then the holder of any Warrant may apply to the Supreme Court of the State of [[Address 5: Address]] County of [[Address 5: Address]] appointment of a successor Warrant Agent at the Company’s cost. Any successor Warrant Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such court, shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of [[Address 6: Address]] standing and having its principal office in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of [[Address 7: Address]] under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority.

8.2.2. **Notice of Successor Warrant Agent**. In the event a successor Warrant Agent shall be appointed, the Company shall give notice thereof to the predecessor Warrant Agent and the transfer agent for the Common Stock not later than the effective date of any such appointment.

8.2.3. **Merger or Consolidation of Warrant Agent**.

8.4.1. **Reliance on Company Statement**. Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Warrant Agreement, the Warrant Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a statement signed by the President or Chairman of the Board of the Company and delivered to the Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent may rely upon such statement for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

8.4.2. **Indemnity**. The Warrant Agent shall be liable hereunder only for its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.

8.4.3. **Exclusions**. The Warrant Agent shall have no responsibility with respect to the validity of this Agreement or with respect to the validity or execution of any Warrant (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Warrant; nor shall it be responsible to make any adjustments required under the provisions of Section 4 hereof or responsible for the manner, method, or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such adjustment; nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Warrant or as to whether any shares of Common Stock will when issued be valid and fully paid and nonassessable.

^^**Acceptance of Agency**. The Warrant Agent hereby accepts the agency established by this Agreement and agrees to perform the same upon the terms and conditions herein set forth and among other things, shall account promptly to the Company with respect to Warrants exercised and concurrently account for, and pay to the Company, all moneys received by the Warrant Agent for the purchase of shares of Common Stock through the exercise of Warrants.
