^^First Right of Purchase.

^^Any Stockholder proposing to make any Transfer of Securities other than any Transfer of the type described in clauses (a) through (c) of Section 2.1 above, shall (x) require prior consent required pursuant to Section 2.1 and (y) comply with the provisions of this Section 2.2 and Section 2.3. At least forty-five (45) days prior to any such proposed Transfer, the transferring Stockholder (the “Transferring Stockholder”) will deliver a written notice (the “Investor Offer Notice”) to the Company. The Company shall promptly deliver a copy of such Investor Offer Notice to each of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Non-Transferring Stockholders”). The Investor Offer Notice will disclose in reasonable detail the number of Securities proposed to be transferred, the class or classes of such Securities, the proposed price, terms and conditions of the Transfer and the identity of the proposed transferee.

^^Subject to the terms of this Section 2.2, the Company may elect to purchase all or a portion of the Securities specified in the Investor Offer Notice at the price and on the terms specified therein by delivering written notice of such election to the Transferring Stockholder and the Non-Transferring Stockholders within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Investor Offer Notice (the “Company Election Period”). If the Company does not elect to purchase all of such Securities prior to the expiration of the Company Election Period, each of the Non-Transferring Stockholders may elect to purchase the balance of the Securities specified in the Investor Offer Notice at the price and on the terms specified therein by delivering written notice of such election to the Transferring Stockholder and the Company within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the Company Election Period (the “Stockholder Election Period”).

^^If the Company and/or any Non-Transferring Stockholders elect to purchase all of the Securities of such class being offered, subject to the terms of Section 2.1, the Transfer of such Securities will be consummated within forty-five (45) days after the expiration of the Company Election Period or the Stockholder Election Period, as the case may be. If more than one Non-Transferring Stockholder elects to purchase any of the Securities being offered, each Non-Transferring Stockholder electing to purchase such Securities will be entitled to purchase from the Transferring Stockholder a pro rata portion (based upon the respective numbers of Securities then held by such Non-Transferring Stockholders). If the Company and/or the Non-Transferring Stockholders do not elect to purchase all of the Securities being offered, neither the

Company nor the Non-Transferring Stockholders shall be entitled to purchase any of the Securities being offered and the Transferring Stockholder may, within ninety (90) days but not less than fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the Stockholder Election Period, complete the Transfer of such Securities at a price and on terms no more favorable to the transferees than the price and terms offered in the Investor Offer Notice, provided, that no such Transfer may be completed except in compliance with Section 2.3, if applicable, and unless each of such transferees shall have executed and delivered an Instrument of Accession as a condition precedent to the transfer thereof. If the Transferring Stockholder fails to consummate such Transfer within the ninety (90) day period after the expiration of the Stockholder Election Period, any subsequent proposed Transfer of such Securities shall be once again subject to the provisions of this Section 2.2.

^^Participation Rights. In the event that the Non-Transferring Stockholders and the Company elect not to purchase all of the Securities specified in an Investor Offer Notice, each of the Stockholders other than the Transferring Stockholder may elect to participate in the contemplated sale by delivering written notice to the Transferring Stockholder within fifteen (15) days after expiration of the Company Election Period. If any of such Stockholders elects to participate in such sale (the “Participating Stockholders”), each of the Transferring Stockholder and the Participating Stockholders will be entitled to sell in the contemplated sale, on the same terms as are applicable to the Transferring Stockholder, a pro rata portion (based upon the respective numbers of Securities then held by such Stockholders determined on an as-converted basis) of the Securities to be sold in the contemplated sale. The Transferring Stockholder will (i) use its best efforts to obtain the agreement of the prospective transferee(s) to the participation of the Participating Stockholders in any contemplated sale and will not transfer any of its Securities to the prospective transferee(s) if the prospective transferee(s) declines to allow the participation of the Participating Stockholders on the terms specified herein, and (ii) use good faith efforts to negotiate indemnity provisions with the prospective transferee providing for several and not joint liability and a maximum limit on liability of each of the Participating Stockholders not exceeding the purchase price received by such Participating Stockholders for such Securities; provided, that if the prospective transferee declines to agree to such indemnity provisions, then the Transferring Stockholder and the Participating Stockholders shall negotiate in good faith the terms of, and enter into, a separate contribution agreement on mutually agreeable terms providing that the Transferring Stockholder and the Participating Stockholders shall reimburse one another if required to pay more than their pro rata share (based on the number of Securities sold by such Transferring Stockholder or Participating Stockholder) of any indemnification claim arising out of representations and warranties made with respect to the Company, and not with respect to such Participating Stockholder or such Participating Stockholder’s Securities.

^^Transfers of Securities in Breach of this Agreement.

^^In the event of any Transfer of Securities made in breach of this Agreement, commencing immediately upon the date of such attempted Transfer (i) such Transfer shall be void and of no effect, (ii) no dividend of any kind or any distribution pursuant to any liquidation, redemption or otherwise shall be paid by the Company to the purported transferee in respect of such Securities, with the amount of any such dividend or distribution being retained by the

Company until such time as such Transfer has been finally rescinded and reversed, and (iii) neither the Transferring Stockholder nor the purported transferee shall be entitled to exercise any rights with respect to such Securities under this Agreement until such Transfer in breach of this Agreement has been rescinded.

^^If a Transferring Stockholder sells any Securities in contravention of the participation rights under Section 2.3 hereof, each Participating Stockholder who timely exercises the participation rights provided pursuant to Section 2.3, in addition to such remedies as may be available at law or in equity or hereunder, may require the Transferring Stockholder to purchase from such Participating Stockholder the number of Securities that such Participating Stockholder would have been entitled to sell to the proposed purchaser under Section 2.3 had the sale been effected pursuant to and in compliance with the terms of Section 2.3. Any such sale will be made on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as would have applied had the Participating Stockholder been entitled to participate in the sale to the proposed purchaser pursuant to Section 2.3, except that such sale (including, without limitation, delivery of the purchase price) must be made within ninety (90) days after the Participating Stockholder learns of the prohibited Transfer, rather than the time frame otherwise provided in Section 2.3. The Transferring Stockholder shall also reimburse the Participating Stockholder for all fees and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred by such Participating Stockholder pursuant to any exercise of its right to require the Transferring Stockholder to purchase its shares pursuant to this Section 2.3(b).

^SALE OF THE COMPANY.

^FIRST REFUSAL RIGHTS.

^^Pre-Emptive Rights. Except for the issuance of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or containing options or rights to acquire shares of Common Stock) (i) pursuant to a Public Sale, (ii) as consideration for the acquisition of all or any substantial portion of the assets or all or any portion of the capital stock of any Person, (iii) upon conversion of shares of one class of capital stock of the Company into shares of another class of capital stock of the Company, or (iv) to any employee or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as employment-related compensation in a transaction approved by the Board of Directors of the Company so long as the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to such employees and directors does not exceed [[Shares 2: Number]] shares (subject to appropriate and ratable adjustment as a result of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, reclassifications, reorganizations or any other similar events), if the Company authorizes the issuance and sale of any shares of any class of capital stock or any securities convertible into or containing options or rights to acquire any shares of any class of capital stock (other than as a dividend on the outstanding Common Stock), the Company will first offer to sell to each Eligible Major Holder a *pro rata* portion of such securities (based upon the respective number of Securities then held by all Eligible Major Holders on a fully-diluted basis). Each Eligible Major Holder will be entitled to purchase all or part of such stock or securities at the same price and on the same terms as such stock or securities are to be offered to any other Persons.

^^Stockholders’ Exercise of Right. Each Eligible Major Holder entitled to purchase securities under this Section 5 must exercise such Eligible Major Holder’s purchase rights hereunder within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the Company describing in reasonable detail the stock or securities being offered, the purchase price thereof, the payment terms and such Eligible Major Holder’s percentage allotment.

^^Company’s Exercise of Right. Upon the expiration of the offering period described above, the Company will be free to sell such stock or securities which the Eligible Major Holders entitled to purchase such stock or securities have not elected to purchase during the ninety (90) days following such expiration on terms and conditions no more favorable to the purchasers thereof, in the aggregate, than those offered to such Eligible Major Holders. Any stock or securities offered or sold by the Company after such 90-day period must be reoffered to the Eligible Major Holders entitled to purchase such stock or securities pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.

^INFORMATION RIGHTS.

^^Delivery of Information. The Company shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to each Eligible Major Holder other than any Eligible Major Holder that is a Competitor, or is employed by, acts as a consultant to, or is a stockholder, partner or other holder of an equity or partnership interest in any Competitor, unless such Eligible Major Holder executes a confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company containing appropriate restrictions on the disclosure and use of such information:

^^as soon as practicable, but in any event within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, a consolidated income statement for such fiscal year, a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and statement of stockholder’s equity as of the end of such fiscal year, and a consolidated statement of cash flows for such fiscal year, such year-end financial reports to be in reasonable detail, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and audited and certified by independent public accountants of nationally recognized standing selected by the Board of Directors of the Company;

^^within thirty (30) days of the end of each month, an unaudited income statement and statement of cash flows for each of the Company’s operating subsidiaries for such month, a balance sheet for and as of the end of such month, and a report setting forth the comparison of such month unaudited statements to the statements for the same month in the previous year and projected results for such month on a monthly and year to date basis, all in reasonable detail;

^^within forty-five (45) days of the end of each fiscal quarter, an unaudited consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows of the Company for such fiscal quarter, a consolidated balance sheet for and as of the end of such fiscal quarter, and a report setting forth the comparison of such fiscal quarter’s unaudited statements to the statements for the same fiscal quarter in the previous year and projected results for such fiscal quarter on a quarterly and year to date basis, all in reasonable detail;

^^as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days prior to the end of each fiscal year, a budget and business plan for the Company and each of the Company’s operating subsidiaries for the next fiscal year, prepared on a monthly basis, including balance sheets and income statements for such months and, as soon as prepared, any other budgets or revised budgets prepared by the Company or any of its operating subsidiaries;

^^with respect to the financial statements called for in subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 6.1, an instrument executed by the Chief Financial Officer and President of the Company or the Company’s operating subsidiary, as the case may be, and certifying that, to the best of such Person’s knowledge, such financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied with prior practice for earlier periods (with the exception of footnotes that may be required by GAAP) and fairly present the financial condition of the Company or the Company’s operating subsidiary, as the case may be, and its results of operation for the period specified, subject to year-end audit adjustment, together with a separate report that includes in reasonable detail management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and the results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the end of and for the fiscal periods covered by such financial statements; and

^^such other information relating to the financial condition, business, prospects or corporate affairs of the Company and its operating subsidiaries as such Eligible Major Holder may from time to time reasonably request.

Each Stockholder hereby acknowledges that except for the information rights provided by this Section 6.1, by Section 10.7 of the Acquisition Agreement, or by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time, no Stockholder shall have any rights to demand or receive information, financial or otherwise, from the Company with respect to any matter.

^^Inspection. The Company shall permit each Eligible Major Holder (and its representatives) other than any Eligible Major Holder that is a Competitor, or is employed by, acts as a consultant to, or is a stockholder, partner or other holder of an equity or partnership interest in any Competitor, upon reasonable request, at such requesting Eligible Major Holder’s expense, to visit and inspect the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ properties, to examine its or its subsidiaries’ books of account and records (and to make reasonable copies) and to discuss the Company’s or its subsidiaries affairs, finances and accounts with its or its subsidiaries’ officers, all at such reasonable times as may be reasonably requested; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.2 to provide access to any information which it reasonably considers to be a trade secret or confidential information, unless the requesting stockholder signs a nondisclosure agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company containing appropriate restrictions on the disclosure and use of such information.

^^Confidentiality. Each Eligible Major Holder receiving information under the covenants set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 hereby agrees to hold in confidence and trust and to act in a fiduciary manner with respect to all information so provided and to use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that any third party to which it provides such information pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall hold such information in confidence and trust; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, each of WestView and each member of the AIG Group may, after giving the Company an opportunity to review generally in form and substance such information, include summary financial information concerning the Company and general statements concerning the nature and progress of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ business in its reports to its limited partners; and provided, further, that Jerrold Rosenbaum may provide American International Specialty Lines Insurance Company, the issuer of a seller-side insurance policy in connection with the Acquisition Agreement, with the Company’s annual financial statements and information regarding material amendments and waivers under the Company’s credit agreement with its primary lenders, as provided pursuant to Section 6.1 above and Section 10.7 of the Acquisition Agreement, to the extent required by such insurance policy, without such provision being deemed a violation of this Section 6.3.

^ADDITIONAL LEGEND. So long as any Securities are subject to the provisions hereof, all certificates or instruments representing Securities will have imprinted on them the following legend:

The shares represented by this certificate are subject to the terms of a certain Stockholder Agreement, dated as of [[Date 1]], among the issuer of this certificate and certain stockholders. The Stockholder Agreement contains certain restrictive provisions relating to the voting and transfer of shares of the stock represented hereby. A copy of the Stockholder Agreement is on file at the Company’s principal offices. Upon written request to the Company’s Secretary, a copy of the Stockholder Agreement will be provided without charge to appropriately interested persons, as determined by such Secretary.

^SEVERABILITY. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

^ENTIRE AGREEMENT. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, this document embodies the complete agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes and preempts any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

^SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Company and the Stockholders and their respective successors and assigns.

^COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts each of which will be an original and all of which taken together will constitute one and the same agreement.

^REMEDIES. The Stockholders will be entitled to enforce their rights under this Agreement specifically (without posting a bond or other security), to recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights existing in their favor. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement and that any Stockholder may in its sole discretion apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any violation of the provisions of this Agreement. In the event of any dispute involving the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to collect reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such dispute from the other parties to such dispute.

^AMENDMENT AND WAIVER. This Agreement may be amended only by a writing duly authorized and executed by (x) Stockholders holding at least sixty-six and 2/3 percent (66 2/[[Percentage 4]]%) of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at such time (including for purposes of this calculation any issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock), and (y) Stockholders holding at least fifty percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at such time (including for purposes of this calculation any issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock); provided, however, that no such amendment shall be effective against any Stockholder who has not consented to such amendment to the extent that such amendment would be adverse to the interests of such Stockholder in any material respect and would have a disproportionate impact in any material respect on the rights of such Stockholder in its capacity as a Stockholder hereunder when measured against the impact of such amendment on the rights of other Stockholders in their capacities as Stockholders hereunder. Any rights of the Stockholders under this Agreement may be waived in writing by (x) Stockholders holding at least sixty-six and 2/3 percent (66 2/[[Percentage 4]]%) of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at such time (including for purposes of this calculation any issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock), and (y) Stockholders holding at least fifty percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at such time (including for purposes of this calculation any issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock); provided, however, that no such waiver shall be effective against any Stockholder who has not consented to such waiver to the extent that such waiver would be adverse to the interests of such Stockholder in any material respect and would have a disproportionate impact in any material respect on the rights of such Stockholder in its capacity as a Stockholder hereunder when measured against the impact of such waiver on the rights of other Stockholders in their capacities as Stockholders hereunder. The Company shall notify all Stockholders of each amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement that could reasonably be expected to affect the rights of such Stockholder hereunder at least five (5) business bays prior to the effectiveness of such modification, amendment or waiver. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement will in no way be construed as a waiver of such provisions and will not affect the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every provision of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

^EMPLOYMENT. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to create for any Stockholder who is an officer or employee of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company a right to continued employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or employment in the same position or on the same terms as those currently in effect.

^TERMINATION. This Agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the completion of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation or dissolution of the Company, (b) the completion of a Qualified Public Offering, or (c) the consummation of an Approved Sale.
