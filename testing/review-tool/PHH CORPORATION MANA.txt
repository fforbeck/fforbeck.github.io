Cash Incentive Awards may be granted to officers and other employees of the Company or its Affiliates selected in the discretion of the Committee for participation in this MIP for a Plan Year.

\centered V. AWARDS 

^^Establishment of Performance Goals or Other Criteria. With respect to Cash Incentive Awards to Covered Employees, the Committee shall establish the Performance Goals for the payment under such Cash Incentive Awards no later than the ninetieth (90th) day of each Plan Year. With respect to other Cash Incentive Awards, the Committee may establish such performance criteria, if any, that it determines in its sole discretion are necessary or appropriate in such time and manner as the Committee may determine. Performance Goals and other performance criteria, as applicable, will be reflected in the applicable Award Agreements for any Cash Incentive Award hereunder. 

^^Cash Incentive Award Limitations and Committee Discretion. The Committee will establish the maximum Cash Incentive Payment that can be made pursuant to a Cash Incentive 

^^^^^ 
Award; provided that the maximum value of the aggregate Cash Incentive Payments that any Grantee may receive under this MIP in respect of any Plan Year is $[[USD Value 1: Number]] million. Subject to Section 5.5, after establishing the maximum Cash Incentive Payment that can be made pursuant to a Cash Incentive Award under this Article V for a Plan Year, the Committee may reduce (or, solely in the case of a Grantee who is not a Covered Employee, increase) the Cash Incentive Payment payable to a Grantee based upon the Committee’s determination of the individual performance of such Grantee for such Plan Year and such other factors as the Committee deems appropriate. 

^^Determination of Achievement of Performance Goals or Other Measures. The Committee shall certify the level of achievement of the Performance Goals or such other performance criteria as soon as practical after the end of the Plan Year for which the determination is being made, including by certifying that the Performance Goals or such other performance criteria were not attained, if applicable. 

^^Cash Incentive Payments. Unless contrary to applicable law and except as provided in Section 5.5, no Grantee shall vest in a Cash Incentive Payment unless he or she is employed by the Company or an Affiliate on the date the Committee certifies the level of achievement under the Performance Goals or other performance criteria under Section 5.3. Except as provided in Section 5.5, no Cash Incentive Payment shall be made to a Grantee prior to the certification by the Committee of the level to which the Performance Goals or other performance criteria have been attained. Vested Cash Incentive Payments under this Section will be made within thirty (30) days following such certification, but in no event later than [[Date 1: Date]] of the Plan Year in which such certification occurs. If the Committee exercises discretion in Section 5.2 to reduce a Grantee’s Cash Incentive Payment to zero dollars, or if the Committee certifies that the Performance Goals or other performance criteria have not been met (and, solely in the case of an employee other than a Covered Employee, does not increase the amount of the Cash Incentive Payment), the Cash Incentive Payment will be deemed paid as of the date such discretion is exercised or certification is made, as applicable. 

^^Change in Control Provisions.  

^^Unless otherwise determined by the Committee and evidenced in an Award Agreement in respect of a Cash Incentive Award, in the event of a Change in Control before certification by the Committee pursuant to Section 5.3 is made, the restrictions, deferral limitations, payment conditions, and forfeiture conditions applicable to any Cash Incentive Award granted under this MIP shall lapse and the Cash Incentive Payment in respect of such Cash Incentive Award shall be deemed fully vested, and any performance conditions (including, without limitation, Performance Goals) imposed with respect to such Cash Incentive Award shall be deemed to be fully achieved. Payment of vested Cash Incentive Payments under this Section will be made as soon as practicable following the Change in Control, but in no event later than [[Date 1]] of the Plan Year in which the Change in Control occurs. 

^^Unless otherwise determined by the Committee and evidenced in an Award Agreement in respect of a Cash Incentive Award, if (i) a Change in Control occurs after the Committee certifies the level of attainment of Performance Goals or other performance 

^^^^^ 
criteria under Section 5.3 and before any Cash Incentive Payment in respect of such Cash Incentive Award is paid, and (ii) the Grantee is employed by the Company or an Affiliate on the date of the Change in Control, then the Committee will not have any discretion to reduce such Cash Incentive Payment pursuant to Section 5.2 on or after the effective date of the Change in Control. 

\centered VI. GENERAL PROVISIONS
