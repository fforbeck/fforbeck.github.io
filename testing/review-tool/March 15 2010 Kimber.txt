You have been acting in that capacity since [[Date 3: Date]], however, you and the Company agree that there is a need to clarify or amend certain of the provisions of your existing agreement. This letter is intended to amend and restate your existing agreement and this agreement (the “Agreement”) will be the sole obligation of the Company with respect to your employment; it being specifically understood that this Agreement does not supersede any provisions of any individual long term incentive or other benefit plans or programs to which you may be a party. The “Term” of this Agreement shall continue until the close of business on [[Date 4: Date]]. Thereafter, the Term shall automatically extend annually for one year terms unless and until terminated as provided herein. The purpose of this Agreement is to ratify and confirm your acceptance of the terms of your employment. All capitalized terms that are not defined herein are defined in Appendix 1 hereto. 

^As Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, you shall report to and serve at the direction of the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company or to such other person as may be designated from time to time.

^^Bonus

Your annual target bonus will be, at a minimum, [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of your Base Salary, or $[[USD Value 2: Number]] at your current Base Salary, with the potential to increase your bonus to a maximum of [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of your Base Salary or $[[USD Value 3: Number]] at your current Base Salary; provided, however, that the actual amount of your bonus will be dependent upon the achievement of the Company’s annual financial and other goals consistent with those established for other members of executive management, as well as the accomplishment of individual objectives, established annually by the Board of Directors (the actual bonus awarded to you in any given year, which may be greater or less than your target bonus is referred to herein as your “Annual Bonus” for that year). Except as provided in sections 6(a), (b), and (d), below to receive a bonus you must be employed through the end of the year for which the bonus is payable (the “Bonus Year”).

Any equity award agreement will provide that in the event of any change in the capitalization of the Company such as a stock spilt or a corporate transaction such as a merger, consolidation, separation or otherwise, the number and class of RSU’s or options, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted by the Company’s Compensation and Human Resources Committee, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights.

^It is agreed and understood that your employment with the Company is to be at will, and either you or the Company may terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason, with or without cause, and with or without notice to the other; nothing herein or elsewhere constitutes or shall be construed as a commitment to employ you for any period of time.

^You agree that all inventions, improvements, trade secrets, reports, manuals, computer programs, systems, tapes and other ideas and materials developed or invented by you during the period of your employment with the Company, either solely or in collaboration with others, which relate to the actual or anticipated business or research of the Company, which result from or are suggested by any work you may do for the Company, or which result from

\centered -Page 3- 

^^^^^ 
use of the Company’s premises or the Company’s or its customers’ property (collectively, the “Developments”) shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. You hereby assign to the Company your entire right and interest in any such Developments, and will hereafter execute any documents in connection therewith that the Company may reasonably request.

^As an inducement to the Company to make this offer to you, you represent and warrant that you are not a party to any agreement or obligation for personal services, and there exists no impediment or restraint, contractual or otherwise on your power, right or ability to accept this offer and to perform the duties and obligations specified herein.

^In the event of a termination or cessation of your employment with the Company for any reason, the sole rights and obligations of the Company in connection with your termination shall be those provided under the relevant provision below.

^^In the event of your death or Retirement during the Term, the Company will pay to you, your beneficiaries or your estate, as the case may be, as soon as practicable after your death or Retirement (with the exception of subsection (iii) below which will be paid in the Bonus Payment Year), (i) the unpaid Base Salary through the date of your death or Retirement, plus payment of any bonus amount payable to you (as determined by the Compensation Committee) in respect of any bonus period ended prior to your termination of employment (collectively, the “Compensation Payments”), (ii) for any accrued but unused vacation days, to the extent and in the amounts, if any, provided under the Company’s usual policies and arrangements (the “Vacation Payment”), and (iii) the Annual Bonus, in respect of the fiscal year in which your termination occurs (which shall be in an amount that is consistent with other Company executives of your level), multiplied by (x) the number of days prior to your termination during such fiscal year, divided by (y) 365 (the “Prorated Bonus”).

^^In the event you suffer a Disability the Company may terminate your employment on written notice thereof, and the Company will pay you (i) amounts payable pursuant to the terms of any applicable disability insurance policy or similar arrangement (if any) that the Company maintains, (ii) the Compensation Payments, (iii) the Vacation Payment and (iv) the Prorated Bonus.

^^In the event your employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or by you other than as a result of Constructive Termination, Disability, Retirement, or death, the Company will pay to you (i) unpaid Base Salary through the date of your termination, plus (ii) the Vacation Payment, and you will be entitled to no other compensation, except as otherwise due to you under applicable law or the terms of any applicable plan or program. You will not be entitled, among other things, to the payment of any unpaid bonus payments in respect of any period prior to your termination of employment.

^^In the event you are subjected to Involuntary Termination other than for Cause, Disability or death, or you terminate your employment as a result of Constructive Termination, the

\centered -Page 4- 

^^^^^ 
Company will (i) pay to you the Compensation Payments, the Vacation Payment, and the Prorated Bonus, (ii) continue to pay your Base Salary then in effect and Annual Bonus (which shall be in an amount that is consistent with other Company executives of your level), for a period of 12 months after your termination, paid in the same periodic installments as such Base Salary, and during the same Bonus Payment Year (as the case may be) as you would have been paid had you remained on the Company’s ordinary payroll during such period; and (iii) continued participation in benefits, to the extent the plans allow, until the earlier of the 12-month anniversary of the termination date or until you are eligible to receive comparable benefits from subsequent employment or government assistance. For purposes of clarification, the period of the foregoing severance for salary, bonus and benefits shall be 12 months regardless of how much time remains in the then current Term of this Agreement. In other words, there shall be no adjustment, up or down, to the amount of severance regardless of the amount of time remaining in the then current Term at the time of termination. Moreover, you will remain entitled to the foregoing severance notwithstanding the Company’s failure to extend any Term beyond its expiration date. Regarding your Annual Bonus, by way of example should you be terminated on [[Date 6: Date]] of 2010, you will be paid the Prorated Bonus for the year in which you were terminated (which is equal to the Annual Bonus for such year prorated for the period from the Effective Date through [[Date 6]]), plus the balance of the Bonus for 2010 (i.e., the Annual Bonus for the first six months of your 12 month severance period), plus six months of the Annual Bonus for 2011 (the Annual Bonus for the remaining 6 months of the 12 month severance period). Payment of the foregoing severance is subject to your execution, delivery and non-revocation of the release attached hereto as Appendix 2 within thirty (30) days following the termination of your employment, and your resignation, effective as of the date of your termination of employment, as an officer and/or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The COBRA election period will not commence until the expiration of that 12-month period. The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or the in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year. Your right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. Payment will be provided only if the filing of the claim for payment and completion of the reimbursement payment can reasonably be completed by the end of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred. In order to be entitled to the foregoing in the event of Constructive Termination, you must provide written notice, including details describing the basis of your claim, to the Company within 60 days of the occurrence of the event(s) giving rise to a claim of Constructive Termination and the Company will have 30 days to remedy any non-compliance. In the event the Company fails or is unable to remedy any non-compliance, the effective date of your termination of employment shall be 90 days from the date the Company received notice, unless otherwise agreed by you and the Company. Should you fail to provide the foregoing notice, you will thereafter be barred from receiving benefits based upon the events giving rise to the claim.

^^Treatment of Grants of Equity  Any grants of equity that you may receive subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and the disposition of such awards in the event of the occurrence of any of the circumstances set forth in subsections (a)  (d) above, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the plan(s) or program(s) under which the awards are granted; provided,

\centered -Page 5- 

^^^^^ 
however, that to the extent not inconsistent with such plan(s) or program(s), any such awards will provide that, in the event of termination pursuant to (i) subsections (a) or (b) above, or as a result of Constructive Termination, all outstanding equity awards will immediately vest, or (ii) subsection (c) or (d) above, other than as a result of Constructive Termination, all unvested awards will be forfeited, subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee to vest some or all of such awards. In the event of a Change of Control, you will not have the right to terminate your employment, other than as otherwise permitted in this Agreement; however, upon such Change of Control, all unvested equity will immediately vest and all restrictions on any stock awarded shall lapse.

^^To be entitled to severance benefits under this section you must terminate employment from the Company. For this purpose, your termination of employment must be considered a “separation from service” within the meaning of Code §409A(a)(2)(A)(i) and any guidance or regulations issued thereunder.

^Non-Compete. It is understood and agreed that you will have substantial relationships with specific businesses and personnel, prospective and existing, vendors, contractors, customers, and employees of the Company that result in the creation of customer goodwill. Therefore, following the termination of employment under this Agreement for any reason and continuing for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of such termination, so long as the Company or any affiliate, successor or assigns thereof is in the real estate investment trust/mortgage servicing business/insurance agency or like business within the Restricted Area, unless the Board of Directors approves an exception, you shall not, directly or indirectly, for yourself or on behalf of, or in conjunction with, any other person, persons, company, partnership, corporation, business entity or otherwise:

^^Call upon, solicit, write, direct, divert, influence, or accept business (either directly or indirectly) with respect to any account or customer or prospective customer of the Company or any corporation controlling, controlled by, under common control with, or otherwise related to the Company, including but not limited to Walter Investment Management Corporation, Hanover Capital Mortgage Holdings, Inc., Walter Mortgage Company, or any other affiliated companies; or

^^Hire away any independent contractors or personnel of the Company and/or entice any such persons to leave the employ of the Company or its affiliated entities without the prior written consent of the Company

^Non-Disparagement. Following the termination of employment under this Agreement for any reason and continuing for so long as the Company or any affiliate, successor or assigns thereof carries on the name or like business within the Restricted Area, you shall not, directly or indirectly, for yourself or on behalf of, or in conjunction with, any other person, persons, company, partnership, corporation, business entity or otherwise:

\centered -Page 6- 

^^^^^ 
^^Make any statements or announcements or permit anyone to make any public statements or announcements concerning your termination with the Company, or

^^Make any statements that are inflammatory, detrimental, slanderous, or negative in any way to the interests of the Company or its affiliated entities.

^You acknowledge and agree that you will respect and safeguard the Company’s property, trade secrets and confidential information. You acknowledge that the Company’s electronic communication systems (such as email and voicemail) are maintained to assist in the conduct of the Company’s business and that such systems and data exchanged or stored thereon are Company property. In the event that you leave the employ of the Company, you will not disclose any Company trade secrets or confidential information you acquired while an employee of the Company to any other person or entity, including without limitation, a subsequent employer, or use such information in any manner.

^If any of the Company’s financial statements are required to be restated due to errors, omissions, fraud, or misconduct, the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion but acting in good faith, direct that the Company recover all or a portion of any past or future compensation from any Participant with respect to any fiscal year of the Company for which the financial results are negatively affected by such restatement. For purposes of this paragraph, errors, omissions, fraud, or misconduct may include and is not limited to circumstances where the Company has been required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement, as enforced by the SEC, and the Board of Directors has determined in its sole discretion that a participant had knowledge of the material noncompliance or the circumstances that gave rise to such noncompliance and failed to take reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the appropriate individuals within the company, or the participant personally and knowingly engaged in practices which materially contributed to the circumstances that enabled a material noncompliance to occur.

^Tax Compliance Delay in Payment. If the Company reasonably determines that any payment or benefit due under this Agreement, or any other amount that may become due to you after termination of employment, is subject to Section 409A of the Code, and also determines that you are a “specified employee,” as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, upon your termination of employment for any reason other than death (whether by resignation or otherwise), no amount may be paid to you or on your behalf earlier than six months after the date of your termination of employment (or, if earlier, your death) if such payment would violate the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder, and payment shall be made, or commence to be made, as the case may be, on the date that is six months and one day after your termination of employment (or, if earlier, one day after your death). For this purpose, you will be considered a “specified employee” if you are employed by an employer that has its stock publicly traded on an established securities market or certain related entities have their stock traded on an established securities market and you are a “key employee”, with the exact meaning of “specified employee”, “key employee” and “publicly traded” defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

\centered -Page 7- 

^^^^^ 
Notwithstanding the above, the Company hereby retains discretion to make determinations regarding the identification of “specified employees” and to take any necessary corporate action in connection with such determination.

^You acknowledge and agree that you have read this letter agreement carefully, have been advised by the Company to consult with an attorney regarding its contents, and that you fully understand the same.

^It is agreed and understood that this acceptance letter shall constitute our entire agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall supersede all prior agreements, discussions, understandings and proposals (written or oral) relating to your employment with the Company. This Agreement will be interpreted under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida without regard to conflicts of laws. Any dispute over the terms and conditions or application of this Agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitration will be heard by one arbitrator to be chosen as provided by the rules of the AAA and shall be held in Tampa, Florida. If you prevail in the dispute, the Company will pay your reasonable fees and costs in connection with the matter (including attorneys fees). Whether you have prevailed or not shall be determined by the arbitrator, or if the arbitrator declines to determine whether or not you have prevailed, you will be deemed to have prevailed if, in the case of monetary damages you receive in excess of [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of what you demanded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of section 7-9, the party that is in breach or in threatened breach acknowledges and agrees that the other party will suffer irreparable harm that is not subject to being cured with monetary damages and that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in a state court of the State of Florida.

^You and the Company intend that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Code Section 409A and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively “Code Section 409A”) and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined by you or the Company to not comply with Code Section 409A, the Company shall fully cooperate with you to reform the Agreement to correct such noncompliance to the extent permitted under any guidance, procedure, or other method promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service now or in the future that provides for such correction as a means to avoid or mitigate any taxes, interest, or penalties that would otherwise be incurred by you on account of such non-compliance.
