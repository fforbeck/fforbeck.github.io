At its option, but without being obligated to do so, the Collateral Agent may, upon prior notice to any applicable Grantor, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (a) pay and discharge past due taxes, assessments and governmental charges, at any time levied on or with respect to any of the Collateral of such Grantor which such Grantor has failed to pay and discharge in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement or any of the other Secured Creditor Documents, (b) pay and discharge any claims of other creditors of such Grantor which are secured by any Lien on any Collateral, other than a Permitted Lien, (c) pay for the maintenance, repair, restoration and preservation of the Collateral to the extent such Grantor fails to comply with its obligations in regard thereto under this Agreement and the other Secured Creditor Documents or the Collateral Agent reasonably believes payment of the same is necessary or appropriate to avoid a material loss or material diminution in value of the Collateral, and/or (d) obtain and pay the premiums on insurance for the Collateral which such Grantor fails to maintain in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and the other Secured Creditor Documents, and each Grantor agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent on demand for all payments and expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent with respect to such Grantor or any of its Collateral pursuant to the foregoing authorization, *provided, however,* that nothing in this Section shall be construed as excusing any Grantor from the performance of, or imposing any obligation on the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor to cure or perform, any covenants or other agreements of any Grantor with respect to any of the foregoing matters as set forth herein or in any of the other Loan Documents. 

^^Commercial Tort Claims. If any Grantor shall at any time hold or acquire a Commercial Tort Claim, the recovery from which could reasonably be expected to exceed $[[USD Value 5: Number]] such Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof in a writing signed by such Grantor, which sets forth the details thereof and grants to the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Creditors) a Lien thereon and on the Proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

Pledged Collateral owned by it, and to give consents, waivers or ratifications in respect thereof, *provided* that no vote shall be cast or any consent, waiver or ratification given or any action taken which would violate, result in the breach of any covenant contained in or be inconsistent with, any of the terms of this Agreement, any other Secured Creditor Document or any Designated Hedge Document, or which would have the effect of materially impairing the position or interests of the Collateral Agent or any Secured Creditor therein. All such rights of such Grantor to vote and to give consents, waivers and ratifications shall cease in case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing. 

^^Entitlement of Grantors to Cash Dividends and Distributions. A Grantor shall be entitled to receive all cash dividends or distributions payable in respect of its Pledged Collateral, except as otherwise provided in this Article VI. 

^^Entitlement of Collateral Agent to Dividends and Distributions. The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to receive, and to retain as part of the Pledged Collateral: 

^^all cash dividends and distributions payable in respect of the Pledged Collateral at any time when an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and 

^^regardless of whether or not an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of payment or distribution thereof:

^^^all other or additional stock, other securities, partnership interests, membership interests or property (including cash) paid or distributed in respect of the Pledged Collateral by way of stock-split, spin-off, split-up, reclassification, combination of shares or similar rearrangement; and

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be 

^^^^^ 
continuing, all dividends and distributions received by the Collateral Agent and then held by it pursuant to this Article VI as part of the Pledged Collateral will be applied as provided in Section 8.4.

^^Registration under 1933 Act, etc. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and a Grantor shall have received from the Collateral Agent a written request or requests that such Grantor cause any registration, qualification or compliance under any Federal or state securities Law or Laws to be effected with respect to all or any part of the Pledged Equity Interests of its Subsidiaries, such Grantor as soon as practicable and at its sole expense will use its best efforts to cause such registration to be effected (and be kept effective) and will use its best efforts to cause such qualification and compliance to be effected (and be kept effective) as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of such stock, including, without limitation, registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as then in effect (the “Securities Act”) (or any similar statute then in effect), appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state securities Laws and appropriate compliance with any other governmental requirements, *provided* that the Collateral Agent shall furnish to such Grantor such information regarding the Collateral Agent as such Grantor may request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance. The relevant Grantor will advise the Collateral Agent in writing as to the progress of each such registration, qualification or compliance and as to the completion thereof, will furnish to the Collateral Agent such number of prospectuses, offering circulars and other documents incident thereto as the Collateral Agent from time to time may reasonably request, and will indemnify the Collateral Agent and all others participating in the distribution of such Pledged Equity Interests against all claims, losses, damages or liabilities caused by any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) or by any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by an untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to such Grantor by the Collateral Agent expressly for use therein. 

^^Sale of Pledged Equity Interests in Connection with Enforcement. If at any time when the Collateral Agent shall determine to exercise its right to sell all or any part of the Pledged Equity Interests pursuant to Section 8.1, and such Pledged Equity Interests or the part thereof to be sold shall not, for any reason whatsoever, be effectively registered under the Securities Act, the Collateral Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law now or hereafter in effect, sell such Pledged Equity Interests or part thereof by private sale in such manner and under such circumstances as the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable in order that such sale may legally be effected without such registration, *provided* that at least 10 days’ prior notice of the time and place of any such sale shall be given to the relevant Grantor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in 

^^^^^ 
any such event the Collateral Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a) may proceed to make such private sale notwithstanding that a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Pledged Equity Interests or part thereof shall have been filed under such Securities Act, (b) may approach and negotiate with a single possible purchaser to effect such sale and (c) may restrict such sale to a purchaser who will represent and agree that such purchaser is purchasing for its own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or sale of such Pledged Equity Interests or part thereof. In the event of any such sale, the Collateral Agent shall incur no responsibility or liability to any Grantor for selling all or any part of the Pledged Equity Interests at a price which the Collateral Agent may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might be realized if the sale were deferred until the registration as aforesaid.

^^^forthwith cause the same to be moved to the place or places so designated by the Collateral Agent and there delivered to the Collateral Agent, 

^^^store and keep any Collateral so delivered to the Collateral Agent at such place or places pending further action by the Collateral Agent as provided in Section 8.2, and

^^Disposition of the Collateral. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, any Collateral repossessed by the Collateral Agent under or pursuant to Section 8.1 and any other Collateral whether or not so repossessed by the Collateral Agent, may be sold, assigned, leased or otherwise disposed of under one or more contracts or as an entirety, and without the necessity of gathering at the place of sale of the property to be sold, and in general in such manner, at such time or times, at such place or places and on such terms as the Collateral Agent may, in compliance with any mandatory requirements of applicable Law, determine to be commercially reasonable. Any of the Collateral may be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of, in the condition in which the same existed when taken by the Collateral Agent or after any overhaul or repair which the Collateral Agent shall determine to be commercially reasonable. Except in the case of any Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is a of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, (a) in the case of any such disposition which shall be a private sale or other private proceedings permitted by such requirements, such sale shall be made upon not less than 10 days’ prior written notice to such Grantor specifying the time at which such disposition is to be made and the intended sale price or other consideration therefor, and shall be subject, for the 10 days after the giving of such notice, to the right of the relevant Grantor or any nominee of the relevant Grantor to acquire the Collateral involved at a price or for such other consideration at least equal to the intended sale price or other consideration so specified, and (b) in the case of any such disposition which shall be a public sale permitted by such requirements, such sale shall be made upon not less than 10 days’ prior written notice to the relevant Grantor specifying the time and place of such sale and, in the absence of applicable requirements of Law, shall be by public auction (which may, at the Collateral Agent’s sole option, be subject to reserve), after publication of notice of such auction not less than 10 days prior thereto in two newspapers in general circulation in the city where such Collateral is located. To the extent permitted by any such requirement of Law, the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Creditors (or certain of them) may bid for and become the purchaser (by bidding in Secured Obligations or otherwise) of the Collateral or any item thereof, offered for sale in accordance with this Section without accountability to the relevant Grantor (except to the extent of surplus money received as provided in Section 8.4). Unless so obligated under mandatory requirements of applicable Law, the Collateral Agent shall not be required to make disposition of the Collateral within a period of time which does not permit the giving of notice to the relevant Grantor as hereinabove specified. The Collateral Agent need give the relevant Grantor only such notice of disposition as the Collateral Agent shall deem to be reasonably practicable in view of such mandatory requirements of applicable Law.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, EACH GRANTOR HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTICE AND JUDICIAL HEARING IN CONNECTION WITH THE COLLATERAL AGENT’S TAKING POSSESSION OR THE COLLATERAL AGENT’S DISPOSITION OF ANY OF THE COLLATERAL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL PRIOR NOTICE AND HEARING FOR ANY PREJUDGMENT REMEDY OR REMEDIES AND ANY SUCH RIGHT WHICH THE GRANTOR WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE UNDER 

^^^^^ 
THE CONSTITUTION OR ANY STATUTE OF THE UNITED STATES OR OF ANY STATE, and each Grantor hereby further waives, to the extent permitted by Law: (i) all damages occasioned by such taking of possession except any damages which are the direct result of the Collateral Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; (ii) all other requirements as to the time, place and terms of sale or other requirements with respect to the enforcement of the Collateral Agent’s rights hereunder; and (iii) all rights of redemption, appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or moratorium now or hereafter in force under any applicable Law in order to prevent or delay the enforcement of this Agreement or the absolute sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof, and each Grantor, for itself and all who may claim under it, insofar as it or they now or hereafter lawfully may, hereby waives the benefit of all such Laws to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law now or hereafter in effect. Any sale of, or the grant of options to purchase, or any other realization upon, any Collateral shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim and demand, either at law or in equity, of the relevant Grantor therein and thereto, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against the relevant Grantor and against any and all Persons claiming or attempting to claim the Collateral so sold, optioned or realized upon, or any part thereof, from, through and under the relevant Grantor. 

^^Application of Proceeds. All Collateral and proceeds of Collateral obtained and realized by the Collateral Agent in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement pursuant to this Article 8 shall be applied as set forth in the Credit Agreement.

All such rights, powers and remedies shall be cumulative and the exercise or the beginning of exercise of one shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise of any other or others. No delay or omission of the Collateral Agent in the exercise of any such right, power or remedy, or partial or single exercise thereof, and no renewal or extension of any of the Secured Obligations, shall impair or constitute a waiver of any such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. No notice to or demand on any Grantor in any case shall entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Collateral Agent to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. In the event that the Collateral Agent shall bring any suit to enforce any of its rights hereunder and shall be entitled to judgment, then in such suit the Collateral Agent may recover reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, and the amounts thereof shall be included in such judgment. 

^^Discontinuance of Proceedings. In case the Collateral Agent shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right, power or remedy under this Agreement by foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Collateral Agent, then and in every such case the relevant Grantor, the Collateral Agent and each holder of any of the Secured Obligations 

^^^^^ 
shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder with respect to the Collateral subject to the security interest created under this Agreement, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Collateral Agent shall continue as if no such proceeding had been instituted.
