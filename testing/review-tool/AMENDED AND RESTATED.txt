^^**Effects of the Merger**. At the Effective Time (i) the separate existence of the Buyer Subsidiary shall cease and the Buyer Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company (the Company following the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the “**Surviving Company**”) and (ii) the restated articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to change the name of the Surviving Company from [[Company]] to [[Buyer]] and to reduce the authorized capital stock of the Company to [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of common stock, par value $[[USD Value 6: Number]] per share, and as so amended, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Company, until further amended in accordance with the NGCL.

^^**Conversion of Capital Stock**. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Buyer Subsidiary:

^^Each of the Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares held in the Company’s treasury or by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and Shares owned beneficially by the Buyer, Buyer Subsidiary or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Buyer) shall be converted into and represent the right to receive $[[USD Value 7: Number]] in cash per share of the Shares, without any interest thereon (the “**Merger Consideration**”).

^^**Cancellation of Stock Owned by the Parties and Their Subsidiaries**. All of the Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and any Shares owned by the Buyer, any shareholder of the Buyer, Buyer Subsidiary or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no shares of the Buyer or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

^^**Capital Stock of the Buyer Subsidiary.** Each share of the capital stock of the Buyer Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $.001 par value per share, of the Surviving Company.

^^**Treatment of Company Stock Options and Common Stock Purchase Warrants**. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (and/or, if appropriate, the Compensation Committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary to provide that each Company Stock Option and each Company Stock Purchase Warrant, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall, at the Effective Time, be cancelled, and each holder thereof, other than the Buyer, Buyer Subsidiary, any shareholder of the Buyer or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Buyer, shall be entitled to receive a payment in cash as provided in Section 7.8(b) hereof (subject to any applicable withholding taxes). As provided herein, unless otherwise determined by the Buyer, the Company Stock Plans (and any feature of any other Benefit Plans or other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company) shall terminate as of the Effective Time. After the date hereof, the Company will not issue any Company Stock Options, Company Stock Purchase Warrants or other options, warrants, rights or agreements which would entitle any person to acquire any capital stock of the Company or, except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.1(d) or in Section 7.8, to receive any payment in respect thereof.

^^**Exchange of Certificates, Company Stock Options and Company Stock Purchase Warrants**. The procedures for exchanging outstanding Shares for Merger Consideration, and outstanding Company Stock Options and Company Stock Purchase Warrants for Option Consideration, pursuant to the Merger are as follows:

^^**Exchange Agent**. As of the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit with the Company’s transfer agent or another bank or trust company designated by the Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “**Exchange Agent**”), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, Company Stock Options and Company Stock Purchase Warrants, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.2, through the Exchange Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and the aggregate Option Consideration (such aggregate consideration being hereinafter referred to as the “**Exchange Fund**”), payable pursuant to Section 3.1 to holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the “**Certificates**”), and pursuant to Sections 3.1(d) and 7.8(b) to the holders of Company Stock Options and Company Stock Purchase Warrants.

^^**Exchange Procedures**. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate, Company Stock Option and Company Stock Purchase Warrant (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates, Company Stock Options and Company Stock Purchase Warrants shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates, Company Stock Options and Company Stock Purchase Warrants to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Buyer may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates, Company Stock Options and Company Stock Purchase Warrants in exchange for each holder’s respective Merger Consideration or Option Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate, Company Stock Option or Company Stock Purchase Warrant for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Buyer, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of each Certificate, Company Stock Option and Company Stock Purchase Warrant shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash representing (i) that number of whole Shares evidenced by such Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled; and/or (ii) the Option Consideration payable with respect to the surrendered Company Stock Option or Company Stock Purchase Warrant. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the payment representing the Merger Consideration payable to the registered holder may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate, Company Stock Option and Company Stock Purchase Warrant shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the payment contemplated by this Section 3.2 or Section 7.8(b), as the case may be.

^^**No Further Ownership Rights in Shares**. All payments upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books or register of members of the Surviving Company of the Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.

^^**Termination of Exchange Fund**. Subject to any applicable escheat or similar Law, any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Shares 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of Shares who has not previously complied with this Section 3.2 shall thereafter look only to the Buyer, as a general unsecured creditor, for payment of his, her or its claim for Merger Consideration.

^^**Investment of Exchange Fund** The Exchange Agent shall invest cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Buyer, on a daily basis, **provided** that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable pursuant to the provisions of this Article III. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Buyer.

^^**No Liability**. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Shares delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to this Article III would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

^^**Withholding Rights**. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “**Code**”), or any other applicable provision of Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Company or the Buyer, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Company or the Buyer, as the case may be.

^^**Lost Certificates**. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

\centered **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

The Company represents and warrants to the Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary that the statements contained in this Article IV are true and correct, subject to the exceptions set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to the Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary on or before the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the “**Company Disclosure Schedule**”). The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article IV that contain references to such Company Disclosure Schedule; **provided**, **however**, that any information contained in response to any numbered or lettered section of this Article IV shall constitute disclosure pursuant to this Article IV. For purposes of this Agreement, each statement or other item of information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty made by the Company in Article IV.

^^**Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries**.

^^Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except for such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, that have not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

^^The Company SEC Reports set forth a complete and accurate list of (i) all of the Company’s Subsidiaries and the Company’s direct or indirect equity interest therein and (ii) the Company’s interest in any Person which is not a Subsidiary, including any Person in which the Company has a non-controlling equity interest.
