^**Office**. The office of the Trust shall be in care of the Owner Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office or at such other address in Delaware as the Owner Trustee may designate by written notice to the Certificateholders and the Depositor.

^**Purposes and Powers**. The purpose of the Trust is to engage in the following activities and the Trust shall have the power and authority:

^^to issue the Notes pursuant to the Indenture and the Trust Certificates pursuant to this Agreement and to sell, transfer and exchange the Notes and the Trust Certificates and to pay interest on and principal on the Notes and distributions on the Trust Certificates, all in accordance with the Basic Documents;

^^with the proceeds of the sale of the Notes and the Trust Certificates, to purchase the Receivables, to fund the Reserve Account, to pay the organizational, start-up and transactional expenses of the Trust and to pay the balance of such proceeds to the Depositor pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement;

^^to assign, grant, transfer, pledge, mortgage and convey the Trust Estate pursuant to the Indenture and to hold, manage and distribute to the Certificateholders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Sale and Servicing Agreement any portion of the Trust Estate released from the Lien of, and remitted to the Trust pursuant to, the Indenture;

^^to enter into and perform its obligations under the Basic Documents to which it is to be a party;

^^to engage in those activities, including entering into agreements, that are necessary, suitable or convenient to accomplish the foregoing or are incidental thereto or connected therewith;

^^to enter into derivative transactions upon the satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition at any time or from time to time after the issuance of the Notes. The notional amount of those derivatives may (but need not) exceed the amount of the Notes and need not relate to or counteract risks associated with the Notes or the Receivables; provided, however, that any payments to the applicable counterparties to the derivative transactions on any Payment Date are to be made only after all required payments to the Noteholders and deposits to the Reserve Account on such Payment Date; and

^^subject to compliance with the Basic Documents, to engage in such other activities as may be required in connection with conservation of the Trust Estate and the making of distributions to the Certificateholders and the Noteholders.

The Trust is hereby authorized to engage in the foregoing activities. The Trust shall not engage in any activity other than in connection with the foregoing or other than as required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or the Basic Documents.

^**Appointment of Owner Trustee**. The Depositor hereby appoints the Owner Trustee as trustee of the Trust effective as of the date hereof, to have all the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

^**Initial Capital Contribution of Trust Estate**. Pursuant to the Original Trust Agreement, the Depositor sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed and set over to the Owner Trustee, as of the date thereof, the sum of $[[USD Value 2: Number]]. The Owner Trustee hereby acknowledges receipt in trust from the Depositor, as of the date of the Original Trust Agreement, of the foregoing contribution, which shall constitute the initial Trust Estate and shall be deposited in the Certificate Distribution Account. The Depositor shall pay organizational expenses of the Trust as they may arise or shall, upon the request of the Owner Trustee, promptly reimburse the Owner Trustee for any such expenses paid by the Owner Trustee.

^**Declaration of Trust**. The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will hold the Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the conditions set forth herein for the use and benefit of the Certificateholders, subject to the obligations of the Trust under the Basic Documents. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Trust constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust Act and that this Agreement constitute the governing instrument of such statutory trust. It is the intention of the parties hereto that, for income and franchise tax purposes, until the Trust Certificates are held by more than one Person, the Trust will be disregarded as an entity separate from the Depositor (or another Person that beneficially owns all of the Trust Certificates) and the Notes will be characterized as debt. At such time that the Trust Certificates are held by more than one Person, it is the intention of the parties hereto that, for income and franchise tax purposes, the Trust shall be treated as a partnership, with the assets of the partnership being the Receivables and other assets held by the Trust, the partners of the partnership, being the Certificateholders, and the Notes being debt of the partnership. The Depositor and the Certificateholders by acceptance of a Trust Certificate agree to such treatment and agree to take no action inconsistent with such treatment. The parties agree that, unless otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities, until the Trust Certificates are held by more than one Person the Trust will not file or cause to be filed annual or other necessary tax returns, reports and other forms inconsistent with the characterization of the Trust as a disregarded entity of its owner. Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee shall have all rights, powers and duties set forth herein and in the Statutory Trust Act with respect to accomplishing the purposes of the Trust.

^**Title to Trust Property**. Subject to the Indenture, legal title to all the Trust Estate shall be vested at all times in the Trust as a separate legal entity except where applicable law in any jurisdiction requires title to any part of the Trust Estate to be vested in a trustee or trustees, in which case title shall be deemed to be vested in the Owner Trustee, a co-trustee or a separate trustee, as the case may be; provided that prior to taking title to any part of the Trust Estate, the Owner Trustee will notify the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee.

^**Situs of Trust**. The Trust will be located and administered in the State of Delaware. All bank accounts maintained by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall be located in the State of Delaware or the State of New York. The Trust shall not have any employees; provided, however, that nothing herein shall restrict or prohibit the Owner Trustee from having employees within or without the State of Delaware. Payments will be received by the Trust only in Delaware or New York, and payments will be made by the Trust only from Delaware or New York. The only office of the Trust will be at the Corporate Trust Office in the State of Delaware.

^**Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Depositor**. The Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Owner Trustee that:

^^The Depositor is duly organized and validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its business as such properties are currently owned and such business is presently conducted.

^^The Depositor is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing and has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in all jurisdictions in which the ownership or lease of its property or the conduct of its business shall require such qualifications.

^^The Depositor has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to carry out its terms; the Depositor has full power and authority to sell and assign the property to be sold and assigned to and deposited with the Trust and the Depositor has duly authorized such sale and assignment and deposit to the Trust by all necessary corporate action; and the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly authorized by the Depositor by all necessary corporate action.

^^The Depositor has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Depositor, enforceable against the Depositor, in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles.

^^The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the fulfillment of the terms hereof do not conflict with, result in any breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time) a default under, the articles and bylaws of the Depositor, or any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the Depositor is a party or by which it is bound; nor result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, agreement or other instrument (other than pursuant to the Basic Documents); nor violate any law or, to the best of the Depositor’s knowledge, any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Depositor of any court or of any federal or state regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental instrumentality having jurisdiction over the Depositor or its properties.

^^There are no proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of the Depositor, threatened before any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental instrumentality having jurisdiction over the Depositor or its properties (i) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement, (ii) seeking to prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) seeking any determination or ruling that might materially and adversely affect the performance by the Depositor of its obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, this Agreement.

^^The representations and warranties of the Depositor in Section 3.02 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement are true and correct.

^**Federal Income Tax Allocations**. If the Trust Certificates are held by more than one Person, for federal income tax purposes each item of income, gain, loss, credit and deduction for a month shall be allocated to the Certificateholders as of the first Record Date following the end of such month in proportion to their Certificate Percentage Interests on such Record Date. The Trust (or the Administrator in accordance with the Administration Agreement and Section 5.04) is authorized to modify the allocations in this paragraph if necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion, for the allocations to fairly reflect the economic income, gain or loss to the Certificateholders or otherwise comply with the requirements of the Code.

\centered **TRUST CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFER OF INTERESTS**

^**Initial Ownership**. Upon the formation of the Trust by the contribution by the Depositor pursuant to Section 2.05 and until the issuance of the Trust Certificates, the Depositor shall be the sole beneficiary of the Trust.

^**The Trust Certificates**. The Trust Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual or facsimile signature of an authorized officer of the Owner Trustee. Trust Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were, at the time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Trust, shall be validly issued and entitled to the benefit of this Agreement and shall be valid and binding obligations of the Trust, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the authentication and delivery of such Trust Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of authentication and delivery of such Trust Certificates.

If a transfer of the Trust Certificates is permitted pursuant to Section 3.11, a transferee of a Trust Certificate shall become a Certificateholder and shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Certificateholder hereunder upon such transferee’s acceptance of a Trust Certificate duly registered in such transferee’s name pursuant to Section 3.04.

^**Execution, Authentication and Delivery of Trust Certificates**. On the Closing Date, the Owner Trustee shall cause the Trust Certificates in an aggregate Certificate Percentage Interest equal to [[Percentage 1: Number]]% to be executed on behalf of the Trust, authenticated and delivered to or upon the written order of the Depositor, signed by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Trust, without further action by the Depositor, in authorized denominations. No Trust Certificate shall entitle its Holder to any benefit under this Agreement or be valid for any purpose unless there shall appear on such Trust Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A, executed by the Owner Trustee or Citibank, N.A., as the Owner Trustee’s Authenticating Agent, by manual signature; such authentication shall constitute conclusive evidence that such Trust Certificate shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Trust Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.

^**Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Trust Certificates**. The Certificate Registrar shall keep or cause to be kept, at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 3.08, a Certificate Register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Owner Trustee shall provide for the registration of Trust Certificates and of transfers and exchanges of Trust Certificates as herein provided. Wilmington Trust Company shall be the initial Certificate Registrar.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Trust Certificate at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 3.08, the Owner Trustee shall execute, authenticate and deliver (or shall cause its Authenticating Agent to authenticate and deliver), in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Trust Certificates in authorized denominations of a like aggregate amount dated the date of authentication by the Owner Trustee or any Authenticating Agent. At the option of a Certificateholder, Trust Certificates may be exchanged for other Trust Certificates of authorized denominations of a like aggregate amount upon surrender of the Trust Certificates to be exchanged at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 3.08.

Every Trust Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the related Certificateholder or such Certificateholder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. Each Trust Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be cancelled and subsequently disposed of by the Owner Trustee in accordance with its customary practice.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Trust Certificates, but the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Trust Certificates.

The preceding provisions of this Section notwithstanding, the Owner Trustee shall not make, and the Certificate Registrar shall not register transfers or exchanges of, Trust Certificates for a period of 15 days preceding the due date for any payment with respect to the Trust Certificates.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the transfer of the Trust Certificates.

^**Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Trust Certificates**. If (a) any mutilated Trust Certificate shall be surrendered to the Certificate Registrar, or if the Certificate Registrar shall receive evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Trust Certificate and (b) there shall be delivered to the Certificate Registrar and the Owner Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Trust Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute and the Owner Trustee or the Owner Trustee’s Authenticating Agent, shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Trust Certificate, a new Trust Certificate of like tenor and denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Trust Certificate under this Section, the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Trust Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of ownership in the Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Certificate shall be found at any time.

^**Persons Deemed Owners**. Prior to due presentation of a Trust Certificate for registration of transfer, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or any Paying Agent may treat the Person in whose name any Trust Certificate is registered in the Certificate Register as the owner of such Trust Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to Section 5.02 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or any Paying Agent shall be bound by any notice to the contrary.

^**Access to List of Certificateholders’ Names and Addresses**. The Owner Trustee shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Servicer, the Paying Agent and the Depositor, within 15 days after receipt by the Owner Trustee of a written request therefor from the Servicer, the Paying Agent or the Depositor, a list, in such form as the Servicer or the Depositor may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Certificateholders as of the most recent Record Date. The Certificate Registrar shall also promptly furnish to the Owner Trustee and the Paying Agent a copy of such list at any time there is a change therein. If (a) three or more Certificateholders or (b) one or more Holders of Trust Certificates evidencing not less than [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the Certificate Percentage Interests apply in writing to the Owner Trustee, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Certificateholders with respect to their rights under this Agreement or under the Trust Certificates and such application is accompanied by a copy of the communication that such applicants propose to transmit, then the Owner Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, afford such applicants access during normal business hours to the current list of Certificateholders. Each Certificateholder, by receiving and holding a Trust Certificate, shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold any of the Depositor, the Certificate Registrar or the Owner Trustee accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from which such information was derived. The Certificate Registrar shall upon the request of the Owner Trustee provide such list, or access to such list, of Certificateholders as contemplated by this Section.

^**Maintenance of Office or Agency**. The Trust shall designate in the State of Delaware an office or offices or agency or agencies where Trust Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Trust and Owner Trustee in respect of the Trust Certificates and the Basic Documents may be served. The Trust initially designates Wilmington Trust Company as its office for such purposes. The Trust shall give prompt written notice to the Depositor and the Certificateholders of any change in the location of the Certificate Register or any such office or agency.

^**Appointment of Paying Agent**. The Paying Agent shall make distributions to Certificateholders from the Certificate Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.02 and shall report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee. Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making the distributions referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke such power and remove the Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee determines in its sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect; provided, however, the Owner Trustee shall have no duty to monitor or oversee the compliance by the Paying Agent of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Basic Document. The Paying Agent initially shall be Citibank, N.A., and any co-paying agent chosen by the Trust. Citibank, N.A. shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days’ written notice to the Owner Trustee. In the event that Citibank, N.A. shall no longer be the Paying Agent, the Depositor, with the consent of the Owner Trustee, shall appoint a successor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). The Trust shall cause such successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent appointed hereunder to execute and deliver to the Trust an instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Trust that, as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Certificateholders. The Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its possession to the Owner Trustee. Any reference in this Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the context requires otherwise.

^**Form of Trust Certificates**. The Trust Certificates, upon original issuance, will be issued in the form of a typewritten Trust Certificate or Trust Certificates representing definitive, fully registered Trust Certificates (the “Definitive Trust Certificates”) and shall be registered in the name of the Depositor or upon order of the Depositor as the initial registered owner thereof. The Owner Trustee shall execute and authenticate, or cause to be authenticated, the Definitive Trust Certificates in accordance with the instructions of the Depositor. The Depositor hereby orders the Owner Trustee to execute and authenticate, or cause to be authenticated, the Definitive Trust Certificates. Neither the Certificate Registrar nor the Owner Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of the Trust Certificates, the Owner Trustee and each Paying Agent shall recognize the Holders of the Trust Certificates as Certificateholders.

In addition, each transferee shall provide to the Owner Trustee its tax identification number, address, nominee name (if applicable) and wire transfer instructions. Prior to any resale, assignment or transfer of the Trust Certificates described in clause (ii) above, each prospective purchaser of the Trust Certificates shall have acknowledged, represented and agreed as follows:

^It is a “qualified institutional buyer” as defined in Rule 144A (“QIB”) and is acquiring the Trust Certificates for its own institutional account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are QIBs).

^It acknowledges that the Trust Certificates have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any jurisdiction.

^It is familiar with Rule 144A and is aware that the sale is being made in reliance on Rule 144A and it is not acquiring the Trust Certificates with a view to, or for resale in connection with, a distribution that would constitute a public offering within the meaning of the Securities Act or a violation of the Securities Act, and that, if in the future it decides to resell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer any Trust Certificates, such Trust Certificates may be resold, assigned, pledged or transferred only (i) to the Depositor or any Affiliate thereof, (ii) so long as such Trust Certificate is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person whom it reasonably believes after due inquiry is a QIB acting for its own account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are QIBs) to whom notice is given that the resale, pledge, assignment or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (iii) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (iv) in a sale, pledge or other transfer made in a transaction otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, in which case (A) the Owner Trustee shall require that both the prospective transferor and the prospective transferee certify to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor in writing the facts surrounding such transfer, which certification shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor and (B) the Owner Trustee shall require a written opinion of counsel (which will not be at the expense of the Depositor or the Owner Trustee) satisfactory to the Depositor and the Owner Trustee to the effect that such transfer will not violate the Securities Act, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities or “Blue Sky” laws of any state of the United States.

^It is aware that it (or any account for which it is purchasing) may be required to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Trust Certificates for an indefinite period, and it (or such account) is able to bear such risk for an indefinite period.

^It understands that the Trust Certificates will bear legends substantially as set forth in Section 3.12.

^If it is acquiring any Trust Certificates for the account of one or more qualified institutional buyers, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such account.

^It (and any Person for which it holds Trust Certificates) has neither acquired nor will it transfer any Trust Certificate it purchases (or any interest therein) or cause any such Trust Certificate (or any interest therein) to be marketed on or through an “established securities market” within the meaning of Section 7704(b)(1) of the Code, including, without limitation, an over-the-counter-market or an interdealer quotation system that regularly disseminates firm buy or sell quotations.

^It (and any Person for which it holds Trust Certificates, collectively for purposes of this paragraph (8), a “transferee”) either (A) is not, and will not become, a partnership, S corporation or grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or a disregarded entity of any of the foregoing) or (B) is such an entity, but none of the direct or indirect beneficial owners of any of the interests in such transferee have allowed or caused, or will allow or cause, [[Percentage 2]]% or more (or, if the Owner Trustee has received an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance acceptable to the Depositor that the proposed transfer to such transferee will not cause the Trust to be treated as a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code, such other percentage as the Owner Trustee may establish prior to the time of such proposed transfer) of the value of such interests in the transferee to be attributable to such transferee’s ownership of Trust Certificates.

^It understands that if it is acquiring any Trust Certificate for the account of one or more Persons, (A) it shall provide to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor information as to the number of such Persons and any changes in the number of such Persons and (B) any such change in the number of Persons for whose account a Trust Certificate is held shall require the written consent of the Owner Trustee, which consent shall be granted unless the Owner Trustee determines that such proposed change in number of Persons would create a risk that the Trust would be classified for federal or any applicable state tax purposes as an association (or a publicly traded partnership) taxable as a corporation.

^It understands that no subsequent transfer of the Trust Certificates (or any interest therein) is permitted unless (A) such transfer is of a Trust Certificate with a Certificate Percentage Interest of at least [[Percentage 3: Number]]%, (B) it causes its proposed transferee to provide to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor a letter substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto, or such other written statement as the Owner Trustee shall prescribe and (C) the Trust consents in writing to the proposed transfer, which consent shall be granted unless the Owner Trustee determines that such transfer would either create a risk that the Trust would be classified for federal or any applicable state tax purposes as an association (or a publicly traded partnership) taxable as a corporation; provided, however, that any attempted transfer that would cause the number of beneficial owners of Trust Certificates in the aggregate to exceed 100 or otherwise cause the Trust to become a publicly traded partnership for income tax purposes shall be a void transfer.

^It understands that the Opinion of Counsel to the Trust that the Trust is not a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation is dependent in part on the accuracy of the representations in paragraphs (7), (8), (9) and (10) above.

^It is a United States Person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.

^It acknowledges that the Owner Trustee, the Depositor, and their Affiliates, and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements.

Each transferee of the Trust Certificates shall be required to execute or to have executed a representation letter substantially in the form of Exhibit C, or may deliver such other representations (or an opinion of counsel) as may be approved by the Owner Trustee and the Depositor, to the effect that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities or “Blue Sky” laws.

In addition, such prospective purchaser shall be responsible for providing additional information or certification, as shall be reasonably requested by the Owner Trustee or the Depositor, to support the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements, it being understood that such additional information is not intended to create additional restrictions on the transfer of the Trust Certificates. Neither the Depositor, the Trust nor the Owner Trustee shall be obligated to register or monitor compliance with the Trust Certificates under the Securities Act or any state securities or “Blue Sky” laws.

In determining compliance with the transfer restrictions contained in this Section, the Owner Trustee may rely upon a written opinion of counsel (which may include in-house counsel of the transferor), the cost of obtaining which shall be an expense of the Holder of the Certificate to be transferred.

^^The Trust Certificates may not be acquired by or for the account of (i) an “employee benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA, (ii) a “plan” described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code or (iii) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of an employee benefit plan’s or a plan’s investment in the entity (each, a “Benefit Plan Investor”). By accepting and holding a Trust Certificate, the Holder thereof shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not a Benefit Plan Investor.

THE HOLDER HEREOF, BY PURCHASING THIS TRUST CERTIFICATE, AGREES THAT THIS TRUST CERTIFICATE MAY BE RESOLD, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR TRANSFERRED ONLY (A) SO LONG AS THE TRUST CERTIFICATE IS ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, TO THE PERSON WHOM THE TRANSFEROR REASONABLY BELIEVES AFTER DUE INQUIRY IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER ACTING FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT (AND NOT FOR THE ACCOUNT OF OTHERS) OR AS A FIDUCIARY OR AGENT FOR OTHERS (WHICH OTHERS ALSO ARE QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS) TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE RESALE, ASSIGNMENT, PLEDGE OR TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A, (B) TO A UNITED STATES PERSON WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 7701(a)(30) OF THE CODE, (C) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (D) IN A TRANSACTION EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND OTHER SECURITIES OR “BLUE SKY” LAWS. IN SUCH CASE THE OWNER TRUSTEE SHALL REQUIRE (I) THAT THE PROSPECTIVE TRANSFEREE CERTIFY TO THE OWNER TRUSTEE AND THE DEPOSITOR IN WRITING THE FACTS SURROUNDING SUCH TRANSFER, WHICH CERTIFICATION SHALL BE IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE SATISFACTORY TO THE OWNER TRUSTEE AND (II) IF REQUESTED BY THE OWNER TRUSTEE, A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH SHALL NOT BE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE OWNER TRUSTEE OR THE DEPOSITOR) SATISFACTORY TO THE OWNER TRUSTEE AND THE DEPOSITOR, TO THE EFFECT THAT SUCH TRANSFER WILL NOT VIOLATE THE SECURITIES ACT, IN EACH CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES OR “BLUE SKY” LAWS OF ANY STATE OR JURISDICTION. ANY ATTEMPTED TRANSFER IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING RESTRICTIONS WILL BE VOID AB INITIO AND THE PURPORTED TRANSFEROR WILL CONTINUE TO BE TREATED AS THE OWNER OF THE TRUST CERTIFICATE FOR ALL PURPOSES.

NO TRUST CERTIFICATE OR INTEREST THEREIN MAY BE ACQUIRED BY OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF (I) AN “EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN” (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(3) OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED (“ERISA”), THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE I OF ERISA, (II) A “PLAN” DESCRIBED IN SECTION 4975(e)(1) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE “CODE”), THAT IS SUBJECT TO SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE OR (III) ANY ENTITY WHOSE UNDERLYING ASSETS INCLUDE PLAN ASSETS BY REASON OF AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN’S OR A PLAN’S INVESTMENT IN THE ENTITY (EACH, A “BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR”). BY ACCEPTING AND HOLDING A TRUST CERTIFICATE, THE HOLDER THEREOF SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE REPRESENTED AND WARRANTED THAT IT IS NOT A BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR.

^**Authenticating Agent**.  
^^The Owner Trustee may appoint one or more Authenticating Agents (each, an “Authenticating Agent”) with respect to the Certificates which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Owner Trustee in authenticating the Certificates in connection with the issuance, delivery, registration of transfer, exchange or repayment of the Certificates. The Owner Trustee hereby appoints Citibank, N.A. as Authenticating Agent for the authentication of Certificates upon any registration of transfer or exchange of such Certificates. Whenever reference is made in this Agreement to the authentication of Certificates by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication on behalf of the Owner Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Owner Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent (other than Citibank, N.A.) shall be subject to acceptance by the Depositor.

^^Any institution succeeding to the corporate agency business of an Authenticating Agent shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Owner Trustee or such Authenticating Agent.

^^An Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor. The Owner Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Depositor. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be acceptable to the Owner Trustee or the Depositor, the Owner Trustee promptly may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent with the consent of the Depositor. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent.

^^The Depositor shall pay the Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section 3.13.

^^Pursuant to an appointment made under this Section 3.13, the Certificates may have endorsed thereon, in lieu of the Owner Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in substantially the following form:

^^No trustee under this Agreement shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee under this Agreement; and

Every instrument appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of this Article 10. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Owner Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Owner Trustee. Each such instrument shall be filed with the Owner Trustee and a copy thereof given to the Administrator.

Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time appoint the Owner Trustee as its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Owner Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor co-trustee or separate trustee.

^^For so long as the Notes are outstanding, for the purpose of satisfying the Depositor’s reporting obligation under the Exchange Act with respect to the Notes, the Owner Trustee shall provide to the Depositor a written description of (i) the commencement of, a material development in or, if applicable, the termination of, any and all legal proceedings against the Owner Trustee or any and all proceedings of which any property of the Owner Trustee is the subject, that would be material to Noteholders; and (ii) any such proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities that would be material to Noteholders. The Owner Trustee shall also notify the Depositor, in writing, as promptly as practicable following notice to or discovery by a Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee of any material changes to proceedings described in the preceding sentence. In addition, the Owner Trustee will furnish to the Depositor, in writing, the necessary disclosure regarding the Owner Trustee describing such proceedings required to be disclosed under Item 1117 of Regulation AB, for inclusion in reports filed by or on behalf of the Depositor pursuant to the Exchange Act. The Depositor will allow the Owner Trustee to review any disclosure relating to material litigation against the Owner Trustee prior to filing such disclosure with the Commission to the extent the Depositor changes the information provided by the Owner Trustee.

Such information shall include, at a minimum, a description of any affiliation between the Owner Trustee and any Transaction Party.

In addition, the Owner Trustee shall provide a description of whether there is, and if so the general character of, any business relationship, agreement, arrangement, transaction or understanding between the Owner Trustee and any Transaction Party that is entered into outside the ordinary course of business or is on terms other than would be obtained in an arm’s length transaction with an unrelated third party, apart from the securitization transaction contemplated by this Agreement, that currently exists or that existed during the past two years and that is material to an investor’s understanding of the Notes.

^^As of the related Payment Date with respect to each Report on Form 10-D with respect to the Notes filed by or on behalf of the Depositor, and as of [[Date 4: Date]] preceding the date each Report on Form 10-K with respect to the Notes is filed, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to represent and warrant that any information previously provided by the Owner Trustee under this Article 12 is materially correct and does not have any material omissions unless the Owner Trustee has provided an update to such information.

^**Indemnification; Remedies**.

^^The Owner Trustee shall indemnify the Depositor, each affiliate of the Depositor, and the respective present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of each of the foregoing, and shall hold each of them harmless from and against any claims, losses, liabilities (including penalties), actions, suits, judgments, demands, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys or, as necessary, consultants and auditors and reasonable costs of investigations) that any of them may sustain arising out of or based upon:

^^Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 12.04 to the contrary, the parties agree that neither the Owner Trustee nor the Depositor shall be liable to the other for any consequential or punitive damages whatsoever, whether in contract, tort (including negligence and strict liability), or any other legal or equitable principle; provided, however, that such limitation shall not be applicable with respect to third party claims made against a party.

NO TRUST CERTIFICATE OR INTEREST THEREIN MAY BE ACQUIRED BY OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF (I) AN “EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN” (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(3) OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED (“ERISA”), THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE I OF ERISA, (II) A “PLAN” DESCRIBED IN SECTION 4975(e)(1), OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE “CODE”) THAT IS SUBJECT TO SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE OR (III) ANY ENTITY WHOSE UNDERLYING ASSETS INCLUDE PLAN ASSETS BY REASON OF AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN’S OR A PLAN’S INVESTMENT IN THE ENTITY (EACH, A “BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR”). BY ACCEPTING AND HOLDING A TRUST CERTIFICATE, THE HOLDER THEREOF SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE REPRESENTED AND WARRANTED THAT IT IS NOT A BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR.

THIS CERTIFIES THAT Hyundai ABS Funding Corporation is the registered owner of a [[Percentage 1]]% Certificate Percentage Interest that is nonassessable, fully-paid, beneficial ownership interest in the assets of Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 2010-A (the “Trust”) formed by Hyundai ABS Funding Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Depositor”).

The Trust is governed by a Amended and Restated Trust Agreement dated as of [[Date 1]] (the “Trust Agreement”), between the Depositor, Administrator and Wilmington Trust Company, as owner trustee (the “Owner Trustee”), a summary of certain of the pertinent provisions of which is set forth below. To the extent not otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Sale and Servicing Agreement among the Trust, the Depositor, Hyundai Capital America, as Seller and Servicer (the “Servicer”) and Citibank, N.A., as Indenture Trustee (“Indenture Trustee”), dated as of [[Date 1]] as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time.

This Certificate is one of the duly authorized Trust Certificates designated as Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 2010-A Asset Backed Trust Certificates (herein called the “Trust Certificates”). Also issued under the Indenture dated as of [[Date 1]] between the Trust and the Indenture Trustee, are four classes of Notes, designated as [[Percentage 4: Number]]% Asset Backed Notes, Class A-1, [[Percentage 5: Number]]% Asset Backed Notes, Class A-2, [[Percentage 6: Number]]% Asset Backed Notes, Class A-3, and [[Percentage 7: Number]]% Asset Backed Notes, Class A-4 (collectively, the “Notes”). This Trust Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Trust Agreement, to which Trust Agreement the holder of this Trust Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such holder is bound. Under the Trust Agreement, there will be distributed on the 15th day of each month (or, if such 15th day is not a Business Day, the next Business Day), commencing on [[Date 5: Date]], to the Person in whose name this Trust Certificate is registered at the close of business on the last day of the preceding month, such Certificateholder’s Certificate Percentage Interest of any amounts available to be distributed to Certificateholders on such date.

The holder of this Trust Certificate acknowledges and agrees that its rights to receive distributions in respect of this Trust Certificate are subordinated to the rights of the Noteholders as described in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture and the Trust Agreement, as applicable.

\centered A-2

It is the intent of the Depositor and the Certificateholders that, for purposes of federal income, state and local income and franchise tax, until the Trust Certificates are beneficially owned by more than one Person, the Trust will be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. At such time that the Trust Certificates are beneficially owned by more than one Person, it is the intent of the Depositor and the Certificateholders that, for purposes of federal income, state and local income and franchise tax, the Trust will be treated as a partnership, the assets of which are the assets held by the Trust, and the Certificateholders will be treated as partners in that partnership. The Depositor and the Certificateholders, by acceptance of a Trust Certificate, agree to treat, and to take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, the Trust as such for tax purposes.

Each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of a Trust Certificate, covenants and agrees that such Certificateholder will not at any time institute against the Depositor, or join in or encourage any institution against the Depositor of, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States federal or state bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating to the Trust Certificates, the Notes, the Trust Agreement or any of the Basic Documents.

Each Certificateholder by accepting a Trust Certificate acknowledges that such Certificateholder’s Trust Certificates represent beneficial interests in the Trust only and do not represent interests in or obligations of Depositor, the Servicer, Administrator, Seller, Owner Trustee, Indenture Trustee or any Affiliate thereof and no recourse may be had against such parties or their assets, except as expressly set forth or contemplated in the Trust Agreement, the Trust Certificates or the Basic Documents. In furtherance of and not in derogation of the foregoing, each Certificateholder, by accepting a Trust Certificate, acknowledges and agrees that it shall have no right, title or interest in or to any assets or interests therein of the Depositor (other than the Trust Estate and Reserve Account relating to this transaction) conveyed or purported to be conveyed by the Depositor to another securitization trust or other Person or Persons in connection therewith (whether by way of a sale, capital contribution or by virtue of the granting of a lien) (“Other Assets”). To the extent that, notwithstanding the agreements and provisions contained herein, a Certificateholder either (i) asserts an interest or claim to, or benefit from, Other Assets, whether asserted against or through the Depositor or any other Person owned by the Depositor, or (ii) is deemed to have any such interest, claim or benefit in or from Other Assets, whether by operation of law, legal process, pursuant to applicable provisions of insolvency laws or otherwise (including by virtue of Section 1111(b) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any successor provision having similar effect under the Bankruptcy Code), and whether deemed asserted against or through the Depositor or any other Person owned by the Depositor, then each Certificateholder, by accepting a Trust Certificate, further acknowledges and agrees that any such interest, claim or benefit in or from Other Assets is and shall be expressly subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full of all obligations and liabilities of the Depositor which, under the terms of the relevant documents relating to the securitization of such Other Assets, are entitled to be paid from, entitled to the benefits of, or otherwise secured by such Other Assets (whether or not any such entitlement or security interest is legally perfected or otherwise entitled to priority of distribution or application under applicable law, including insolvency laws, and whether asserted against Depositor or any other Person owned by the Depositor), including the payment of post-petition interest on such other obligations and liabilities. This subordination agreement shall be deemed a subordination agreement within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. Each Certificateholder, by acceptance of a Trust Certificate, further acknowledges and agrees that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of this paragraph and the terms of this paragraph may be enforced by an action for specific performance. The provisions of this paragraph shall be for the third party benefit of those entitled to rely thereon and shall survive the termination of the Trust Agreement.

\centered A-3

The Trust Certificates may not be acquired by or for the account of (i) an “employee benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA, (ii) a “plan” described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code or (iii) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of an employee benefit plan’s or a plan’s investment in the entity (each, a “Benefit Plan Investor”). By accepting and holding a Trust Certificate, the Holder thereof shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not a Benefit Plan Investor.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been executed by an authorized officer of Owner Trustee, by manual signature, this Trust Certificate shall not entitle the holder hereof to any benefit under the Trust Agreement or the Sale and Servicing Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

THIS TRUST CERTIFICATE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS, AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

Wilmington Trust Company, 
as Owner Trustee  
Ladies and Gentlemen:  
In connection with our proposed purchase of [ ]% Certificate Percentage Interest Asset Backed Trust Certificates (the “Trust Certificates”) of Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 2010-A (the “Issuer”), a trust formed by Hyundai ABS Funding Corporation (the “Depositor”), we confirm that:

^^We are a “qualified institutional buyer” as defined in Rule 144A (“QIB”) and are acquiring the Trust Certificate for our own institutional account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are QIBs);

^^We acknowledge that the Trust Certificates have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any jurisdiction;

^^We are familiar with Rule 144A and are aware that the sale is being made in reliance on Rule 144A and we are not acquiring the Trust Certificates with a view to, or for resale in connection with, a distribution that would constitute a public offering within the meaning of the Securities Act or a violation of the Securities Act, and that, if in the future we decide to resell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer any Trust Certificates, such Trust Certificates may be resold, assigned, pledged or transferred only (i) to the Depositor or any Affiliate thereof, (ii) so long as such Trust Certificate is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person whom we reasonably believe after due inquiry is a QIB acting for its own account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are QIBs) to whom notice is given that the resale, pledge, assignment or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (iii) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (iv) in a sale, pledge or other transfer made in a transaction otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, in which case (A) the Owner Trustee will require that both the prospective transferor and the prospective transferee certify to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor in writing the facts surrounding such transfer, which certification shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor and (B) the Owner Trustee will require a written opinion of counsel (which will not be at the expense of the Depositor or the Owner Trustee) satisfactory to the Depositor and the Owner Trustee to the effect that such transfer will not violate the Securities Act, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities or “Blue Sky” laws of any state of the United States;

\centered C-1

^^We have neither acquired nor will we transfer any Trust Certificate we purchase (or any interest therein) or cause any such Trust Certificate (or any interest therein) to be marketed on or through an “established securities market” within the meaning of Section 7704(b)(1) of the Code, including, without limitation, an over-the-counter-market or an interdealer quotation system that regularly disseminates firm buy or sell quotations.

^^We either (A) are not, and will not become, a partnership, Subchapter S corporation or grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or a disregarded entity of any of the foregoing) or (B) are such an entity, but none of the direct or indirect beneficial owners of any of the interests in us have allowed or caused, or will allow or cause, [[Percentage 2]]% or more (or, if the Owner Trustee has received an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance acceptable to the Depositor that the proposed transfer to such transferee will not cause the Trust to be treated as a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code, such other percentage as the Owner Trustee may establish prior to the time of such proposed transfer) of the value of such interests in us to be attributable to our ownership of Trust Certificates.

^^We (A) are acquiring the Trust Certificate for the account of [______] Persons and we will notify the Owner Trustee of any changes in the number of such Persons and (B) understand that any such change in the number of Persons for whose account a Trust Certificate is held shall require the written consent of the Owner Trustee, which consent shall be granted unless the Owner Trustee determines that such proposed change in number of Persons would create a risk that the Trust would be classified for federal or any applicable state tax purposes as an association (or a publicly traded partnership) taxable as a corporation.

^^We understand that no subsequent transfer of the Trust Certificates is permitted unless (A) such transfer is of a Trust Certificate with a Certificate Percentage Interest of at least [[Percentage 3]]%, (B) we cause the proposed transferee to provide to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor a letter substantially in the form of this Exhibit C to the Trust Agreement or such other written statement as the Owner Trustee shall prescribe and (C) the Trust consents in writing to the proposed transfer, which consent shall be granted unless the Owner Trustee determines that such transfer would create a risk that the Trust would be classified for federal or any applicable state tax purposes as an association (or a publicly traded partnership) taxable as a corporation; provided, however, that any attempted transfer that would either cause the number of registered holders of Trust Certificates in the aggregate to exceed 100 or otherwise cause the Trust to become a publicly traded partnership for income tax purposes shall be a void transfer.

^^We understand that the Opinion of Counsel to the Trust that the Trust is not a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation is dependent in part on the accuracy of the representations in paragraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g) above.

^^We are a United States Person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.

\centered C-2

^^No Trust Certificate will be acquired or held by or for the account of (i) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), that is subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA, (ii) a plan described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code or (iii) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of an employee benefit plan’s or a plan’s investment in the entity. Each Person who acquires any Trust Certificate or interest therein will certify that the foregoing conditions are satisfied.

^^We are aware that we (or any account for which we are purchasing) may be required to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Trust Certificates for an indefinite period, and we (or such account) are able to bear such risk for an indefinite period.

^^We understand that the Trust Certificates will bear legends substantially as set forth in Section 3.12 of the Trust Agreement;

^^If we are acquiring any Trust Certificates for the account of one or more QIB, we represent that we have sole investment discretion with respect to each such account and that we have full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements on behalf of each such account; and

^^We acknowledge that the Owner Trustee, the Depositor, and their Affiliates, and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements.

You are entitled to rely upon this letter and are irrevocably authorized to produce this letter or a copy hereof to any interested party in any administrative or legal proceedings or official inquiry with respect to the matters covered hereby.
