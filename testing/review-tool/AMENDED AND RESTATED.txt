If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then the Chairman shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. 

Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting. 

^^ADJOURNED MEETING: NOTICE The Chairman has the power to adjourn a stockholder meeting. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these Bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

The waiver must be by electronic transmission or in writing signed by the stockholder entitled to the notice, and be delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

\centered VI. INDEMNITY 

^^INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS The Corporation shall indemnify each of its Directors and officers against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware. 

For purposes of this Section 6.1, a “Director” or “officer” of the Corporation includes any person (a) who is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, (b) who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (c) who was a Director or officer of a corporation that was a predecessor corporation of the Corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. Such indemnification shall be a contract right and shall include the right to receive payment of any expenses incurred by the indemnitee in connection with any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, consistent with the provisions of applicable law as then in effect. The right of indemnification provided in this Section 6.1 shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may otherwise be entitled, and the provisions of this Section 6.1 shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and legal representatives of any person entitled to indemnity under this Section 6.1 and shall be applicable to proceedings commenced or continuing after the adoption of this Section 6.1, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after such adoption. In furtherance, but not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, the following procedures, presumptions and remedies shall apply with respect to advancement of expenses and the right to indemnification under this Section 6.1. 

^^Advancement of Expenses. All reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the indemnitee in connection with any proceeding shall be advanced to the indemnitee by the Corporation within 20 days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from the indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the indemnitee and, if required by law at the time of such advance, shall include or be accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay the amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such expenses pursuant to this Section 6.1. 

^^Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification. 

^^^To obtain indemnification under this Section 6.1, an indemnitee shall submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request, including such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (the “Supporting Documentation”). The determination of the indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation. The Secretary of the Corporation shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that the indemnitee has requested indemnification, whereupon the Corporation shall provide such indemnification, including without limitation advancement of expenses, so long as the indemnitee is legally entitled thereto in accordance with applicable law. 

^^^The indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification under this Section 6.1 shall be determined in one of the following ways: (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), notwithstanding whether they constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors; (B) by a written opinion of Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) if (x) a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred and the indemnitee so requests or (y) a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a majority of such Disinterested Directors so directs; (C) by the stockholders of the Corporation (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination); or (D) as provided in Paragraph (c) below. 

^^^In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Paragraph (b)(ii) above, a majority of the Disinterested Directors shall select the Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the indemnitee does not reasonably object; provided, however, that if a Change of Control shall have occurred, the indemnitee shall select such Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Board of Directors does not reasonably object. 

^^^The only basis upon which a finding that indemnification may not be made is that such indemnification is prohibited by law. 

^^Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.1, if a Change of Control shall have occurred, the indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.1 upon submission of a request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation in accordance with Paragraph (b)(i), and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination. In any event, if the person or persons empowered under Paragraph (b)(ii) above to determine entitlement to indemnification shall not have been appointed or shall not have made a determination within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor together with the Supporting Documentation, the indemnitee shall be deemed to be entitled to indemnification and the indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification unless (A) the indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (B) such indemnification is prohibited by law. The termination of any proceeding described in this Section 6.1, or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the right of the indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that the indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that the indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that the indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful. 

^^Remedies of Indemnitee. 

^^^In the event that a determination is made pursuant to Paragraph (b)(ii) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.1: (A) the indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an adjudication of his entitlement to such indemnification either, at the indemnitee’s sole option, in (x) an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction or (y) an arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association; (B) any such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be de novo and the indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of such adverse determination; and (C) in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.1. 

^^^If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made, pursuant to Paragraph (b)(ii) or (iii), that the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within five days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made and shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless (A) the indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (B) such indemnification is prohibited by law. In the event that: (C) advancement of expenses is not timely made pursuant to Paragraph (a); or (D) payment of indemnification is not made within five days after a determination of entitlement to indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to Paragraph (b)(ii) or (iii), the indemnitee shall be entitled to seek judicial enforcement of the Corporation’s obligation to pay to the indemnitee such advancement of expenses or indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may bring an action, in an appropriate court in the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction, contesting the right of the indemnitee to receive indemnification hereunder due to the occurrence of an event described in subclause (A) or (B) of this clause (ii) (a “Disqualifying Event”); provided, however, that in any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving the occurrence of such Disqualifying Event. 

^^^The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceedings or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Paragraph (d) that the procedures and presumptions of this Section 6.1 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Section 6.1. 

^^^In the event that the indemnitee, pursuant to this Paragraph (d), seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Section 6.1, the indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, and shall be indemnified by the Corporation against, any expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee if the indemnitee prevails in such judicial adjudication or arbitration. If it shall be determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that the indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication shall be prorated accordingly. 

^^Definitions. For purposes of this Section 6.1: 

^^^“Change in Control” means a change in control of the Corporation of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”), whether or not the Corporation is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided that, without limitation, such a change in control shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any “person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Act) is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Corporation representing [[Percentage 2: Number]]% or more of the combined voting power of the Corporation’s then outstanding securities without the prior approval of at least a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in office immediately prior to such acquisition; (ii) the Corporation is a party to a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other reorganization, or a proxy contest, as a consequence of which members of the Board of Directors in office immediately prior to such transaction or event constitute less than a majority of the Board of Directors thereafter; or (iii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board of Directors (including for this purpose any new Director whose election or nomination for election by the Corporation’s stockholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the Directors then still in office who were Directors at the beginning of such period) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors. 

^^^“Disinterested Director” means a Director of the Corporation who is not a party to the proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by the indemnitee. 

^^^“Independent Counsel” means a law firm or a member of a law firm that neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (A) the Corporation or the indemnitee in any matter material to either such party; or (B) any other party to the proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this Section 6.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Independent Counsel” shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing under the law of the State of Delaware, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Corporation or the indemnitee in an action to determine the indemnitee’s rights under this Section 6.1. 

^^Invalidity; Severability; Interpretation. If any provision or provisions of this Section 6.1 shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Section 6.1 (including, without limitation, all portions of any Paragraph of this Section 6.1 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Section 6.1 (including, without limitation, all portions of any Paragraph of this Section 6.1 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid; illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. Reference herein to laws, regulations or agencies shall be deemed to include all amendments thereof, substitutions therefor and successors thereto. 

The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article VI shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a Director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee’s heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VI that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal. 

^^INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS The Corporation shall have the power, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to indemnify each of its employees and agents (other than Directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.2, an “employee” or “agent” of the Corporation (other than a Director or officer) includes any person (a) who is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation, (b) who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (c) who was an employee or agent of a corporation that was a predecessor corporation of the Corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. 

^^INSURANCE The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder.

^^CHECKS AND DEPOSITS From time to time, the Board of Directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the Corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments. 

^^EXECUTION OF CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS The Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the Corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount. Such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. 

^^STOCK CERTIFICATES The shares of the Corporation may be either certificated shares or uncertificated shares or a combination thereof. A resolution approved by a majority of the directors on the Board of Directors may provide that some or all of any or all classes or series of the shares of the Corporation will be uncertificated shares. Every holder of stock in the Corporation represented by certificates and, upon written request to the Corporation’s transfer agent or registrar, any holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed, in the name of the Corporation (i) by the President or a Vice President and (ii) by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the Corporation. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Bylaws, the Corporation may adopt a system of issuance, recordation and transfer of its shares by electronic or other means not involving any issuance of certificates, including provisions for notice to purchasers in substitution for any required statements on certificates, and as may be required by applicable corporate securities laws, which system has been approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

^^SIGNATURES Any or all of the signatures on a certificate may be a facsimile, including, but not limited to, signatures of officers of the Corporation and countersignatures of a transfer agent or registrar. In case an officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 

^^SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES If the Corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate, or in the electronic record of such shares if the shares are uncertificated, that the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock. In lieu of the foregoing requirements, and except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate, or in the electronic record of such shares if the shares are uncertificated, that the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

When authorizing such issue, the Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as the Corporation shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

^^DIVIDENDS The Directors of the Corporation, subject to any restrictions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its capital stock in the manner and upon the terms and conditions provided by the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the Corporation’s capital stock. 

The Directors of the Corporation may set apart out of any of the funds of the Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. Such purposes shall include but not be limited to equalizing dividends, repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, and meeting contingencies. 

If the Board of Directors does not fix a record date for determining stockholders entitled to a distribution (i.e., dividend), other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the Corporation’s shares, it is the date the Board of Directors authorizes the distribution. 

^^FISCAL YEAR The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors and may be changed by the Board of Directors. 

^^SEAL The Corporation may adopt a corporate seal which may be altered as desired, and may use the same by causing it or a facsimile thereof, to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced. 

^^TRANSFER OF STOCK Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in the manner prescribed by law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the person named in the certificate (or, in the case of uncertificated shares, only by the person listed as the registered owner thereof) or by his attorney lawfully constituted in writing and upon: (i) in the case of shares represented by certificate, upon the surrender of the certificate therefor, which shall be canceled before a new certificate shall be issued and (ii) in the case of uncertificated shares, upon the receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner thereof. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer (or, in the case of uncertificated shares, upon the receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner thereof), it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate or new uncertificated shares to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate or uncertificated shares and record the transactions upon its books, unless the Corporation has a duty to inquire as to adverse claims with respect to such transfer which has not been discharged. The Corporation shall have no duty to inquire into adverse claims with respect to such transfer unless (a) the Corporation has received a written notification of an adverse claim at a time and in a manner which affords the Corporation a reasonable opportunity to act on it prior to the issuance of a new, reissued or re-registered share certificate and the notification identifies the claimant, the registered owner and the issue of which the share or shares is a part and provides an address for communications directed to the claimant; or (b) the Corporation has required and obtained, with respect to a fiduciary, a copy of a will, trust, indenture, articles of co-partnership, Bylaws or other controlling instruments, for a purpose other than to obtain appropriate evidence of the appointment or incumbency of the fiduciary, and such documents indicate, upon reasonable inspection, the existence of an adverse claim. The Corporation may discharge any duty of inquiry by any reasonable means, including notifying an adverse claimant by registered or certified mail at the address furnished by him or, if there be no such address, at his residence or regular place of business that the security has been presented for registration of transfer by a named person, and that the transfer will be registered unless within 30 days from the date of mailing the notification, either (a) an appropriate restraining order, injunction or other process issues from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (b) an indemnity bond, sufficient in the Corporation’s judgment to protect the Corporation and any transfer agent, registrar or other agent of the Corporation involved from any loss which it or they may suffer by complying with the adverse claim, is filed with the Corporation. 

^^STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS The Corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the Corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the Corporation of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
