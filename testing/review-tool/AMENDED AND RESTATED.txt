\centered **AMENDED AND RESTATED INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT** 

This **INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT** is made and executed as of this [[Date 1: Date]], by and among [[Company]] (the “Company”), [[AWAC]] (“AWAC”), and , an individual resident of  (the “Indemnitee”). 

WHEREAS, the Company is aware that, in order to induce highly competent persons to serve the Company as directors or officers or in other capacities, the Company must provide such persons with adequate protection through insurance and indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the Company; 

WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that the increasing difficulty in obtaining directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, the increases in the cost of such insurance and the general reductions in the coverage of such insurance have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons; 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it is essential to the best interests of the Company shareholders that the Company act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future; 

WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified; 

WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve, and take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries on the condition that he/she be so indemnified; 

WHEREAS, in recognition of the value and benefit that AWAC derives from being a subsidiary of the Company and from the services performed by the Board of Directors and officers of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, AWAC will guaranty the obligations of the Company to provide indemnification to and pay and/or advance the Expenses (as herein after defined) of the Indemnitee to the extent the Company is unable to do so; 

WHEREAS, Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd, a Bermuda company and an affiliate of the Company (“Allied World Bermuda”), and Indemnitee previously entered into an indemnification agreement as of [ ] (the “Former Indemnification Agreement”); and 

^^^^^ 
WHEREAS, Indemnitee and the Company now desire to enter into a new agreement embodying the amended and restated terms of indemnification as set forth herein (this “Agreement”), and the Indemnitee, the Company and Allied World Bermuda hereby agree that this Agreement shall upon its execution and delivery supersede the Former Indemnification Agreement and cause the Former Indemnification Agreement to be of no further force or effect, and that Indemnitee’s rights to indemnification shall be governed solely by and subject solely to this Agreement; 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows: 

^**Service by the Indemnitee**. The Indemnitee agrees to serve and/or continue to serve as [a member of the Board] [an officer] of the Company faithfully and will discharge his/her duties and responsibilities to the best of his/her ability so long as the Indemnitee is duly elected or qualified in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association, as the same may be amended from time to time (the “Articles”), the Organizational Regulations, as the same may be amended from time to time, and the Swiss Code of Obligations (the “Swiss Code”), or until his/her earlier death, resignation or removal. The Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other contractual obligation or other obligation imposed by operation by law), in which event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue the Indemnitee in any such position. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the Indemnitee the right to continue in the employ of the Company or as a director of the Company or affect the right of the Company to terminate the Indemnitee’s employment at any time in the sole discretion of the Company, with or without cause, subject to any contract rights of the Indemnitee created or existing otherwise than under this Agreement. 

^**Indemnification**. The Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee as provided in this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by the Articles and the Swiss Code or other applicable law in effect from time to time if he/she acted in good faith and reasonably believed he/she was acting in the best interest of the Company. Without diminishing the scope of the indemnification provided by this Section 2, the rights of indemnification of the Indemnitee provided hereunder shall include, but shall not be limited to, those rights hereinafter set forth, except that no indemnification shall be paid to the Indemnitee: 

^^on account of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding in which judgment is rendered against the Indemnitee for disgorgement of profits made from the purchase or sale by the Indemnitee of securities of the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”), or similar provisions of applicable law; 

^^with respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which the Indemnitee shall have been adjudged in a final non-appealable judgment or decree of a court, arbitral tribunal or governmental or administrative authority of competent jurisdiction to have committed an intentional or grossly negligent breach of his/her duties [as a member of the Board] [as an executive officer] under applicable law; 

^^^^^ 
^^in any circumstance where such indemnification is prohibited by applicable law; 

^^with respect to liability for which payment is actually made to the Indemnitee under a valid and collectible insurance policy or under a valid and enforceable indemnity clause, Articles or agreement (other than this Agreement), except in respect of any liability in excess of payment under such insurance, clause, Articles or agreement; 

^^if a final decision by a court having jurisdiction in the matter shall determine that such indemnification is not lawful (and, in this respect, both the Company and the Indemnitee have been advised that it is the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission that indemnification for liabilities arising under the federal securities laws is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable, and that claims for indemnification should be submitted to the appropriate court for adjudication); or 

^^in connection with any action, suit, investigation or proceeding by the Indemnitee against the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or the directors, officers, employees or other Indemnitees of the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, (i) unless such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) unless the proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company, (iii) unless such indemnification is provided by the Company, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law, or (iv) except as provided in Sections 10 and 12 hereof. 

^**Actions or Proceedings Other Than an Action by or in the Right of the Company**. The Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section 3 if the Indemnitee was or is a party or witness or is threatened to be a party or witness to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, investigation or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature, other than an action by or in the right of the Company, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other entity, including, but not limited to, another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, employee benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any act or omission by him/her in such capacity. Pursuant to this Section 3, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses, judgments, penalties (including excise and similar taxes), fines and amounts paid in settlement which were actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit, investigation or proceeding (including, but not limited to, the investigation, defense or appeal thereof); *provided, however*, that this indemnity shall only apply to the extent permitted by Section 2 and further provided that with respect to any criminal or penal proceeding or investigation, only to the extent the Indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe his/her conduct was unlawful. 

^^^^^ 
^**Actions by or in the Right of the Company**. The Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section 4 if the Indemnitee was or is a party or witness or is threatened to be made a party or witness to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, investigation or proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of another entity, including, but not limited to, another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, employee benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any act or omission by him/her in any such capacity. Pursuant to this Section 4, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action, suit, investigation or proceeding (including, but not limited to the investigation, defense or appeal thereof); *provided, however*, that this indemnity shall only apply to the extent permitted by Section 2 and further provided that with respect to any criminal or penal proceeding or investigation, only to the extent the Indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe his/her conduct was unlawful. 

^**Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party**. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that the Indemnitee has served on behalf of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, as a witness or other participant in any class action or proceeding, or has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding referred to in Section 3 and 4 hereof, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, including, but not limited to, the dismissal of any action without prejudice, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith; *provided, however*, that this indemnity shall only apply to the extent permitted by Section 2. 

^**Partial Indemnification**. If the Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation, defense, appeal or settlement of such suit, action, investigation or proceeding described in Section 3 or 4 hereof, but is not entitled to indemnification for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee to which the Indemnitee is entitled. 

^**Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification**. 

^^To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including documentation and information which is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification. Any Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in 

^^^^^ 
connection with the Indemnitee’s request for indemnification hereunder shall be borne by the Company. 

^^Upon written request by the Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 3 or 4 hereof, the entitlement of the Indemnitee to indemnification pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be determined by the following person or persons, who shall be empowered to make such determination: (i) if a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) (unless (x) the Company receives advice from legal counsel that the Board of Directors is required by applicable law to make the determination, in which case the determination shall be made by the Board of Directors in the manner provided for in clause (ii) of this Section 7(b) or (y) the Indemnitee shall request in writing that such determination be made by the Board of Directors in the manner provided for in clause (ii) of this Section 7(b)) in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (A)(1) by the Board of Directors of the Company, by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined) even though less than a quorum or (B) if there are no such Disinterested Directors, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee. Such Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors and approved by the Indemnitee. If there are no Disinterested Directors and the Board of Directors and the Indemnitee fail to agree on a mutually acceptable Independent Counsel, either the Board of Directors or the Indemnitee may request the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC) to appoint an Independent Counsel in accordance with the provisions regarding the appointment of experts contained in the ICC’s Rules for Expertise. If the person making such determination shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification as to part (but not all) of the application for indemnification, such person shall reasonably prorate such part of indemnification among such claims, issues or matters. If it is so determined that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to the Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such determination. 

^**Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings**. 

^^In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification hereunder and the Company shall have the burden of proof in the making of any determination contrary to such presumption. 

^^The termination of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding described in Section 3 or 4 hereof by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of *nolo contendere* or its equivalent, shall not, of itself: (a) create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he/she reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Company; or (b) otherwise adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitee to indemnification, except as may be provided herein. 

^**Advancement of Expenses**.  

^^Subject to Section 9(b), all reasonable Expenses actually incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit, investigation or proceeding by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the 

^^^^^ 
Company shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, investigation or proceeding, if so requested by the Indemnitee, within 20 days (unless extended by the Board of Directors of the Company) after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from the Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances and a copy of any order, invoice, bill or other evidence of such Expenses reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Indemnitee may submit such statements and evidence from time to time. The Indemnitee’s entitlement to such Expenses shall include those incurred in connection with any proceeding by the Indemnitee seeking an adjudication or award in arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. Such statements and evidence shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith and shall include or be accompanied by a written affirmation by the Indemnitee of the Indemnitee’s good faith belief that the Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under this Agreement and an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. Each written undertaking to pay amounts advanced must be an unlimited general obligation but need not be secured, and shall be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment. 

^^The Company’s obligation to advance Expenses pursuant to this Section 9 shall be subject to the condition that if (A) the Board of Directors of the Company, by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors even though less than a quorum or (B) if there are no such Disinterested Directors, by Independent Counsel (selected in the same manner as in Section 7(b)) in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, has determined that the Indemnitee would not be permitted to the advancement of Expenses (or indemnification in respect thereof) under applicable law or under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the principles set out in Section 2. If such a determination is made, the Indemnitee shall reimburse the Company for any such amounts theretofore paid by the Company. 

^**Remedies of the Indemnitee in Cases of Determination not to Indemnify or to Advance Expenses**. In the event that a determination is made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder or if the payment has not been timely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Section 7, or if Expenses are not advanced pursuant to Section 9, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to a final adjudication by an arbitral tribunal appointed in accordance with Section 25(b). Such proceeding shall be made *de novo*, and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of a determination (if so made) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses. If a determination is made pursuant to the terms of Section 7 hereof that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall in the absence of any new evidence or facts be bound by such determination and shall be precluded from asserting that such determination has not been made or that the procedure by which such determination was made is not valid, binding and enforceable. If the arbitral tribunal shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to any indemnification hereunder, the Company shall pay all reasonable Expenses actually incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such adjudication (including, but not limited to, any appellate proceedings). 

^**Notification and Defense of Claim**. Promptly after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding, the Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Agreement, notify the 

^^^^^ 
Company in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability that it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement or otherwise, except to the extent that the Company may suffer material prejudice by reason of such failure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, with respect to any such action, suit, investigation or proceeding as to which the Indemnitee gives notice to the Company of the commencement thereof: 

^^The Company will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense. 

^^Except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(b), to the extent that it may wish, the Company, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Company to the Indemnitee of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the Company shall not be liable to the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any legal or other Expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ the Indemnitee’s own counsel in such action or lawsuit, but the fees and Expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company, (ii) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action and such determination by the Indemnitee shall be supported by an opinion of counsel, which opinion shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, or (iii) the Company shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of the action, in each of which cases the fees and Expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which the Indemnitee shall have reached the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. 

^^The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall not be required to obtain the consent of the Indemnitee to settle any action, suit, investigation or proceeding which the Company has undertaken to defend if the Company assumes full and sole responsibility for such settlement and such settlement grants the Indemnitee a complete and unqualified release in respect of any potential liability. 

^^If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to this Section 11, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. 

^^^^^ 
The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of the policies. 

^**Other Right to Indemnification**. The rights of indemnification and advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Articles, any agreement, a vote of shareholders of the Company or a resolution of directors of the Company, or otherwise. 

^**Director and Officer Liability Insurance**. The Company shall maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for so long as the Indemnitee’s services are covered hereunder, provided and to the extent that such insurance is available on a commercially reasonable basis. In the event the Company maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, the Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such manner as to provide the Indemnitee the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Company’s officers or directors. However, the Company agrees that the provisions hereof shall remain in effect regardless of whether liability or other insurance coverage is at any time obtained or retained by the Company, except that any payments made to, or on behalf of, the Indemnitee under an insurance policy shall reduce the obligations of the Company hereunder. 

^**Attorney’s Fees and Other Expenses to Enforce Agreement**. In the event that the Indemnitee is subject to or intervenes in any action, suit, investigation or proceeding in which the validity or enforceability of this Agreement is at issue or seeks an adjudication or award in arbitration to enforce the Indemnitee’s rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement the Indemnitee, if he/she prevails in whole or in part in such action, shall be entitled to recover from the Company and shall be indemnified by the Company against any actual expenses for attorneys’ fees and disbursements reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee unless an arbitral tribunal determines that any of the material assertions made by the Indemnitee in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous. 

^**Effective Date**. The provisions of this Agreement shall cover claims, actions, suits, investigations or proceedings whether now pending or hereafter commenced and shall be retroactive to cover acts or omissions or alleged acts or omissions which heretofore have taken place. The Company shall be liable under this Agreement, pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 hereof, for all acts of the Indemnitee while serving as a director and/or officer, notwithstanding the termination of the Indemnitee’s service, if such act was performed or omitted to be performed during the term of the Indemnitee’s service to the Company. 

^**Duration of Agreement**. This Agreement shall survive and continue even though the Indemnitee may have terminated his/her service as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other entity, including, but not limited to, another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, employee benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or by reason of any act or omission by the Indemnitee in any such capacity. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns, including, without limitation, any company or other entity which may have acquired all or substantially all of the Company’s assets or business or 

^^^^^ 
into which the Company may be consolidated or merged, and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee and his/her successors, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors, administrators or other legal representations. The Company shall require any successor or assignee (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place. 

^**Guaranty**. To the extent that the Company is unable to provide the indemnification and/or the payment of Expenses to Indemnitee due hereunder, AWAC hereby agrees to assume such obligations, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other defenses in law or equity that the Company may have. Should AWAC provide such indemnification and/or the payment of Expenses to Indemnitee under this Agreement, the Indemnitee hereby agrees that it shall reimburse or repay AWAC to the same extent that the Indemnitee would otherwise be required to reimburse or repay to the Company under the terms hereof. 

^**Disclosure of Payments**. Except as expressly required by any federal or state securities laws or other federal or state law, neither party shall disclose any payments under this Agreement unless prior approval of the other party is obtained. 

^**Severability**. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, all portions of any Sections of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, all portions of any paragraph of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifest by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. 

^**Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.
