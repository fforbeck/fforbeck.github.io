The Company shall notify the Holder in writing as promptly as reasonably possible following the issuance of any Equity Securities subject to this section, indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or of applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice the “**Dilutive Issuance Notice**”).
