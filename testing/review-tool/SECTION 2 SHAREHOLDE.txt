^^**Special Meetings**  
The Board, the President, or the Chairperson of the Board, may call special meetings of the shareholders for any purpose. The holders of not less than ten percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of all the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote for or against any issue proposed to be considered at the proposed special meeting, if they date, sign and deliver to the Corporation's Secretary a written demand for a special meeting specifying the purpose or purposes for which it is to be held, may call a special meeting of the shareholders for such specified purpose.

^^If an annual or special shareholders meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice of the new date, time, or place shall not be required if the new date, time, or place is announced at that meeting before adjournment, unless a new record date for the adjourned meeting is, or must be, fixed pursuant to (i) Section 2.6(a) of these bylaws or (ii) the Nevada General Corporation Law.

^^Whenever any notice is required to be given to any shareholder pursuant to the provisions of these bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation or the Nevada General Corporation Law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time specified in such notice, and delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes for filing with the corporate records, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice.

^^The attendance of a shareholder at a meeting shall be a waiver of each objection to lack of, or defect in, notice of such meeting or of consideration of a particular matter at that meeting, unless that shareholder, at the beginning of that meeting or prior to consideration of such matter, objects to holding that meeting, transacting business at that meeting, or considering the matter when presented at that meeting.

^^Fixing of Record Date for Determining Shareholders

^^For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, any meeting of shareholders, or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or to make a determination of shareholders for any other purpose, the Board may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination. Such record date shall be not more than seventy (70) days, and in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten (10) days, prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting, or to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which the notice of meeting is mailed or on which the resolution of the Board declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination. Such determination shall apply to any adjournment of that meeting; provided, however, such adjournment is not set for a date more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date fixed for the original meeting.

^^The record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to demand a special shareholders meeting shall be the date the first shareholder signs the demand.

Such record shall be kept on file at the Corporation's principal office or at a place identified in that meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. On written demand, such record shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at any time during normal business hours. Such record shall also be kept open at that meeting for inspection by any shareholder.

^^A shareholder may, on written demand, copy the shareholders' list at such shareholder's expense during regular business hours; provided, however, that:

^^^Such shareholder's demand is made in good faith and for another purpose;

^^^Such shareholder has described with reasonable particularity such shareholder's purpose specified in the written demand; and

^^^The shareholders' list is directly related to such shareholder's purpose.

^^**Quorum**  
^majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter at a meeting by a voting group, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter at a meeting of the shareholders. If a quorum is not present for a matter to be acted upon, a majority of the shares represented at that meeting may adjourn that meeting from time to time without additional notice. If the necessary quorum is present or represented at a reconvened meeting following such an adjournment, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwith­standing the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.

^^**Manner of Acting**  
^^If a quorum exists, action on a matter (other than the election of directors) by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the affirmative vote of a greater number is required by these bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation or the Nevada General Corporation Law.

^^If a matter is to be voted on by a single group, action on that matter is taken when voted upon by that voting group. If a matter is to be voted on by two (2) or more voting groups, action on that matter is taken only when voted upon by each of those voting groups counted separately. Action may be taken by one voting group on a matter even though no action is taken by another voting group entitled to vote on such matter.

^^**Proxies**  
^shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by that shareholder or by his or her attorney-in-fact. Such proxy shall be effective when received by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes at the meeting. A proxy shall become invalid eleven (11) months after the date of its execution, unless otherwise expressly provided in the proxy. A proxy for a specified meeting shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any adjournment of that meeting, but shall not be valid after the final adjournment thereof.

^^**Voting of Shares**  
Each outstanding share entitled to vote shall be entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders.

^^**Voting for Directors**  
Each shareholder may vote, in person or by proxy, the number of shares owned by such shareholder that are entitled to vote at an election of directors, for as many persons as there are directors to be elected and for whose election such shares have a right to vote.

^^**Voting of Shares by Corporations**  
**2.[[Shares 2: Number]] Shares Held by Another Corporation**

Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of such other corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine; provided, however, such shares are not entitled to vote if the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the shares entitled to vote for directors of such other corporation.

**2.13.2** **Shares Held by the Corporation**  
Authorized but unissued shares shall not be voted or counted for determining whether a quorum exists at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time.

**2.14.2** **Documents Bearing Name of Third Parties**

If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of its shareholder, the Secretary or other agent authorized to tabulate votes at the meeting may nevertheless, if acting in good faith, accept such vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the shareholder if:

\centered SECTION 10. INDEMNIFICATION

^^Right to Indemnification of Directors and Officers 

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereafter a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan hereinafter an “indemnitee”), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Nevada General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorney's fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 10.3 of these Bylaws or with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

^^Right to Advancement of Expenses  
The right to indemnification conferred in Section 10.1 of these Bylaws shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding for which such right to indemnification is applicable in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an “advancement of expenses”); provided, however, that, if the Nevada General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an “undertaking”), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a “final adjudication”) that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this section or otherwise.

^^**Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit**  
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 of these Bylaws shall be contract rights. If a claim under Sections 10.1 and 10.2 of these Bylaws is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Nevada General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Nevada General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this section or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

^^Non-Exclusivity of Rights  
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporation's certificate of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

^^Insurance  
The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Nevada General Corporation Law.



The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

^^No Presumption of Bad Faith  
The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of this Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.

^^**Survival of Rights**  
The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

^^**Amendments to Law**

^^**Savings Clause**  
If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, the Corporation shall indemnify each director, [officer or other agent] to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.
