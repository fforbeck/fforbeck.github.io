Any Fund that becomes a party hereto by executing an amendment to this Agreement substantially in the form of Annex B (each such amendment together with the schedules attached thereto, an “**Amendment**”) shall become a party to this Agreement and any references herein to the Fund shall be treated as references to such Fund. The obligations of the Sponsor, Trust, the Custodian and any Fund other than United States Commodity Index Fund, will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Amendment to this Agreement to be entered into with that Fund.

^***Representations and Warranties of BBH&Co***. BBH&Co. hereby represents and warrants that this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by BBH&Co. and does not violate any Applicable Law or conflict with or constitute a default under BBH&Co.’s limited partnership agreement or any agreement, instrument, judgment, order or decree to which BBH&Co. is a party or by which it is bound.

^***Instructions***. Unless otherwise explicitly indicated herein, the Custodian shall perform its duties pursuant to Instructions. As used herein, the term **Instruction** shall mean a directive initiated by the Fund and/or the Sponsor, acting directly or through its board of directors, officers or other Authorized Persons, which directive shall conform to the requirements of this Section 4.

^^***Authorized Persons***. For purposes hereof, an **Authorized Person** shall be a person or entity authorized to give Instructions for or on behalf of the Fund, the Trust and/or the Sponsor by written notices to the Custodian or otherwise in accordance with procedures delivered to and acknowledged by the Custodian, including without limitation the Fund’s Investment Advisor (as defined in Section 13). The Custodian may treat any Authorized Person as having full authority to issue Instructions for or on behalf of the Fund, Trust and/or Sponsor hereunder unless the notice of authorization contains explicit limitations as to said authority. The Custodian shall be entitled to rely upon the authority of Authorized Persons until it receives appropriate written notice from the Trust or the Sponsor to the contrary.

The Sponsor and the Trust, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Fund, hereby designate the Marketing Agent (as such term is defined under an Marketing Agent Agreement entered into by the Sponsor and the Trust, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Fund, as approved by the Custodian (the **Marketing Agent Agreement**)) as an Authorized Person from whom the Custodian is hereby authorized to receive Instructions to accept deposits of cash and securities in connection with the purchase of Units (as such term is defined in the Prospectus) and the distribution of cash and securities in connection with the redemption of Units.

^^***Form of Instruction***. Each Instruction shall be transmitted by such secured or authenticated electro-mechanical means as the Custodian shall make available to the Trust, Fund or the Sponsor from time to time unless the Trust and/or the Sponsor shall elect to transmit such Instruction in accordance with Subsections 4.2.1 through 4.2.3 of this Section.

4.2.1 ***Fund Designated Secured-Transmission Method***. Instructions may be transmitted through a secured or tested electro-mechanical means identified on behalf of the Fund by the Trust, the Sponsor or by an Authorized Person entitled to give Instructions and acknowledged and accepted by the Custodian; it being understood that such acknowledgment shall authorize the Custodian to receive and process such means of delivery but shall not represent a judgment by the Custodian as to the reasonableness or security of the method determined by the Authorized Person.

4.2.2 ***Written Instructions***. Instructions may be transmitted in a writing that bears the manual signature of Authorized Persons.

4.2.3 ***Other Forms of Instruction***. Instructions may also be transmitted by another means determined by the Trust, the Sponsor or Authorized Persons and acknowledged and accepted by the Custodian (subject to the same limits as to acknowledgements as is contained in Subsection 4.2.1, above) including Instructions given orally or by SWIFT, telex or telefax (whether tested or untested).

When an Instruction is given by means established under Subsections 4.2.1 through 4.2.3, it shall be the responsibility of the Custodian to use reasonable care to adhere to any security or other procedures established in writing between the Custodian and the Authorized Person with respect to such means of Instruction, but such Authorized Person shall be solely responsible for determining that the particular means chosen is reasonable under the circumstances. Oral Instructions shall be binding upon the Custodian only if and when the Custodian takes action with respect thereto. With respect to telefax instructions, the parties agree and acknowledge that receipt of legible instructions cannot be assured, that the Custodian cannot verify that authorized signatures on telefax instructions are original or properly affixed, and that the Custodian shall not be liable for losses or expenses incurred through actions taken in reliance on inaccurately stated, illegible or unauthorized telefax instructions. The provisions of Section 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code as currently in effect in the State of New York shall apply to the Fund’s transfers performed in accordance with Instructions. The Funds Transfer Services Schedule (as defined in Section 13) and the Electronic and Online Services Schedule to this Agreement shall each comprise a designation of form of a means of delivering Instructions for purposes of this Section 4.2.

^^***Completeness and Contents of Instructions***. The Authorized Person shall be responsible for assuring the adequacy and accuracy of Instructions. Particularly, upon any acquisition or disposition or other dealing in the Fund’s Investments and upon any delivery and transfer of any Investment or moneys, the person initiating such Instruction shall give the Custodian an Instruction with appropriate detail, including, without limitation:

4.3.1 The transaction date and the date and location of settlement;

4.3.2 The specification of the type of transaction;

4.3.3 A description of the Investments or moneys in question, including, as appropriate, quantity, price per unit, amount of money to be received or delivered and currency information. Where an Instruction is communicated by electronic means, or otherwise where an Instruction contains an identifying number such as a CUSIP, SEDOL or ISIN number, the Custodian shall be entitled to rely on such number as controlling notwithstanding any inconsistency contained in such Instruction, particularly with respect to the Investment description; and

4.3.4 The name of the broker or similar entity concerned with execution of the transaction.

If the Custodian shall determine that an Instruction is either unclear or incomplete, the Custodian may give prompt notice of such determination to the Trust and/or the Sponsor, and the Trust and/or the Sponsor shall thereupon amend or otherwise reform such Instruction. In such event, the Custodian shall have no obligation to take any action in response to the Instruction initially delivered until the redelivery of an amended or reformed Instruction.

^^***Timeliness of Instructions***. In giving an Instruction, the Trust and/or the Sponsor shall take into consideration delays which may occur due to the involvement of a Subcustodian or agent, differences in time zones, and other factors particular to a given market, exchange or issuer. When the Custodian has established specific timing requirements or deadlines with respect to particular classes of Instruction, or when an Instruction is received by the Custodian at such a time that it could not reasonably be expected to have acted on such Instruction due to time zone differences or other factors beyond its reasonable control, the execution of any Instruction received by the Custodian after such deadline or at such time (including any modification or revocation of a previous Instruction) shall be at the risk of the Fund.

^***Safekeeping of Fund Assets***. The Custodian shall hold Investments delivered to it or Subcustodians for the Fund in accordance with the provisions of this Section.

The Custodian is hereby authorized to hold with itself or a Subcustodian, and to record in one or more accounts, all Investments delivered to and accepted by the Custodian, any Subcustodian or their respective agents pursuant to an Instruction or in consequence of any corporate action. The Custodian shall hold Investments for the account of the Fund and shall segregate Investments from assets belonging to the Custodian and shall cause its Subcustodians to segregate Investments from assets belonging to the Subcustodian in an account held for the Fund or in an account maintained by the Subcustodian generally for non-proprietary assets of the Custodian.

^^***Use of Securities Depositories***. The Custodian may deposit and maintain Investments in any Securities Depository (as defined in Section 13), either directly or through one or more Subcustodians appointed by the Custodian. Investments held in a Securities Depository shall be held (a) subject to the agreement, rules, statement of terms and conditions or other document or conditions effective between the Securities Depository and the Custodian or the Subcustodian, as the case may be, and (b) in an account for the Fund or in bulk segregation in an account maintained for the non-proprietary assets of the entity holding such Investments in the Securities Depository. If market practice or the rules and regulations of the Securities Depository prevent the Custodian, the Subcustodian or any agent of either from holding its client assets in such a separate account, the Custodian, the Subcustodian or other agent shall as appropriate segregate such Investments for benefit of the Fund or for the benefit of clients of the Custodian generally on its own books.

^^***Certificated Assets***. Investments which are certificated may be held in registered or bearer form: (a) in the Custodian’s vault; (b) in the vault of a Subcustodian or agent of the Custodian or a Subcustodian; or (c) in an account maintained by the Custodian, Subcustodian or agent at a Securities Depository; all in accordance with customary market practice in the jurisdiction in which any Investments are held.

^^***Registered Assets***. Investments which are registered may be registered in the name of the Custodian, a Subcustodian, or in the name of the Fund or a nominee for any of the foregoing, and may be held in any manner set forth in Section 5.2 above with or without any identification of fiduciary capacity in such registration.

^^***Book Entry Assets***. Investments which are represented by book-entry may be so held in an account maintained by the Book-entry Agent (as defined in Section 13) on behalf of the Custodian, a Subcustodian or another agent of the Custodian, or a Securities Depository.

^^***Replacement of Lost Investments***. In the event of a loss of Investments for which the Custodian is responsible under the terms of this Agreement, the Custodian shall replace such Investment, or in the event that such replacement cannot be effected, the Custodian shall pay to the Fund the fair market value of such Investment based on the last available price as of the close of business in the relevant market on the date that a claim was first made to the Custodian with respect to such loss, or, if less, such other amount as shall be agreed by the parties as the date for settlement.

^***Administrative Duties of the Custodian***. The Custodian shall perform the following administrative duties with respect to Investments of the Fund.

^^***Futures and Over-the-Counter (OTC) Contracts***. If, pursuant to an Instruction, the Custodian shall become a party to an agreement with the Trust or the Sponsor, on behalf of the Fund, and a futures commission merchant regarding margin or a counterparty to an OTC contract (**Tri-Party Agreement**), the Custodian shall (a) receive and retain, to the extent the same is provided to the Custodian, confirmations or other documents evidencing the purchase or sale by the Fund of exchange-traded futures contracts or the entering into of an option, forward or other derivatives transaction by the Fund; (b) when required by such Tri-Party Agreement, deposit and maintain in an account opened pursuant to such Agreement (**Margin Account**) segregated either physically or by book-entry in a Securities Depository for the benefit of any futures commission merchant, such Investments of the Fund as shall have been designated as initial, maintenance or variation “margin” deposits or other collateral intended to secure the Fund’s performance of its obligations under the terms of any exchange-traded futures contracts and commodity options; and (c) thereafter pay, release or transfer Investments into or out of the Margin Account in accordance with the provisions of such Tri-Party Agreement. Alternatively, the Custodian may deliver Investments, in accordance with an Instruction, to a futures commission merchant for margin purposes or to the counterparty or its custodian.

In addition, the Custodian shall not be required to transfer margin or any other assets of the Fund to a Margin Account if at the time of such request, such transfer would reduce the aggregate market value of all unencumbered securities, cash, cash equivalents and other unencumbered liquid assets of the Fund in the custody of the Custodian to less than ten (10) percent of the then current net asset value of the Fund.

^^***Contractual Obligations and Similar Investments***.

The Custodian shall have no responsibility for agreements on behalf of the Fund running to the Trust or the Sponsor as to which it is not a party other than to retain, to the extent the same are provided to the Custodian, documents or copies of documents evidencing the arrangement and, in accordance with an Instruction, to include such arrangements in reports made to the Fund.

The Custodian is hereby authorized to endorse and deliver any instrument required to be so endorsed and delivered to effect collection of any amount due and payable to the Fund with respect to Investments.

^^***Ownership Certificates and Disclosure of the Fund’s Interest***. The Custodian is hereby authorized to execute on behalf of the Fund ownership certificates, affidavits or other disclosure required under Applicable Law or established market practice in connection with the receipt of income, capital gains or other payments by the Fund with respect to Investments, or in connection with the sale, purchase or ownership of Investments.

The Custodian may at any time or times in its discretion appoint (and may at any time remove) agents (other than Subcustodians) to carry out some or all of the administrative provisions of this Agreement (**Agents**), provided, however, that the appointment of such agent shall not relieve the Custodian of its administrative obligations under this Agreement.

^^***Types of Cash Accounts***. Cash accounts opened on the books of the Custodian (**Principal Accounts**) shall be opened in the name of the Fund. Such accounts collectively shall be a deposit obligation of the Custodian and shall be subject to the terms of this Section 7 and the general liability provisions contained in Section 9. Cash accounts opened on the books of a Subcustodian may be opened in the name of the Fund or the Custodian or in the name of the Custodian for its customers generally (**Agency Accounts**). Such deposits shall be obligations of the Subcustodian and shall be treated as an Investment of the Fund. Accordingly, the Custodian shall be responsible for exercising reasonable care in the administration of such accounts but shall not be liable for their repayment in the event such Subcustodian, by reason of its bankruptcy, insolvency or otherwise, fails to make repayment.

7.1.1 ***Administrative Accounts***. In connection with the services provided hereunder, the Custodian is hereby directed to open cash accounts on its books and records from time to time for the purposes of receiving subscriptions and/or processing redemptions on behalf of the Fund and/or for the purposes of aggregating, netting and/or clearing transactions (including, without limitation foreign exchange, repurchase agreements, capital stock activity, expense payment) or other administrative purposes, each on behalf of the Fund (each an “**Account**”). Each such Account shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Fund and/or the Sponsor shall be liable for the satisfaction of its obligations in connection with each Account.

^^***Payments and Credits with Respect to the Cash Accounts***. The Custodian shall make payments from or deposits to any of said accounts in the course of carrying out its administrative duties, including but not limited to income collection with respect to the Fund’s Investments, and otherwise in accordance with Instructions. The Custodian and its Subcustodians shall be required to credit amounts to the cash accounts only when moneys are actually received in cleared funds in accordance with banking practice in the country and currency of deposit. Any credit made to any Principal or Agency Account before actual receipt of cleared funds shall be provisional and may be reversed by the Custodian in the event such payment is not actually collected. Unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by the Custodian or any Subcustodian, all deposits shall be payable only at the branch of the Custodian or Subcustodian where the deposit is made or carried.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Custodian nor any Subcustodian shall be required to repay any deposit made at a foreign branch of either the Custodian or Subcustodian if such branch cannot repay the deposit due to a cause for which the Custodian would not be responsible in accordance with the terms of Section 9 of this Agreement unless the Custodian or such Subcustodian expressly agrees in writing to repay the deposit under such circumstances. All currency transactions in any account opened pursuant to this Agreement are subject to exchange control regulations of the United States and of the country where such currency is the lawful currency or where the account is maintained.

The Custodian may act as principal in any foreign exchange transaction with the Fund in accordance with Section 7.4.2 of this Agreement. The obligations of the Custodian in respect of all foreign exchange transactions (whether or not the Custodian shall act as principal in such transaction) shall be contingent on the free, unencumbered transferability of the currency transacted on the actual settlement date of the transaction.

7.4.1 ***Third Party Foreign Exchange Transactions***. The Custodian shall process foreign exchange transactions (including without limitation contracts, futures, options, and options on futures), where any third party acts as principal counterparty to the Fund on the same basis it performs duties as agent for the Fund with respect to any other of the Fund’s Investments. Accordingly, the Custodian shall only be responsible for delivering or receiving currency on behalf of the Fund in respect of such contracts pursuant to Instructions. The Custodian shall not be responsible for the failure of any counterparty (including any Subcustodian) in such agency transaction to perform its obligations thereunder. The Custodian (a) shall transmit cash and Instructions to and from the currency broker or banking institution with which a foreign exchange contract or option has been executed pursuant hereto, (b) may make free outgoing payments of cash in the form of United States Dollars or foreign currency without receiving confirmation of a foreign exchange contract or option or confirmation that the countervalue currency completing the foreign exchange contract has been delivered or received or that the option has been delivered or received, and (c) shall hold all confirmations, certificates and other documents and agreements received by the Custodian and evidencing or relating to such foreign exchange transactions in safekeeping. The Fund accepts full responsibility for its use of third-party foreign exchange dealers and for execution of said foreign exchange contracts and options and understands that the Fund shall be responsible for any and all costs and interest charges which may be incurred by the Fund or the Custodian as a result of the failure or delay of third parties to deliver foreign exchange.

7.4.2 ***Foreign Exchange with the Custodian as Principal***. The Custodian may as principal undertake foreign exchange transactions with the Fund as the Custodian and the Trust or Sponsor on behalf of the Fund may agree from time to time. In such event, the foreign exchange transaction will be performed in accordance with the particular agreement of the parties, or in the event a principal foreign exchange transaction is initiated by an Instruction in the absence of specific agreement, such transaction will be performed in accordance with the usual commercial terms of the Custodian. In the event that the Fund defaults on the settlement of any such foreign exchange transaction with the Custodian, the Fund shall be liable for contracted currency of the transaction together with any mark to market exposure associated with the replacement purchase of the contracted currency undertaken with the Custodian.

^^***Delays***. If no event of Force Majeure shall have occurred and be continuing and in the event that a delay shall have been caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the Custodian in carrying out an Instruction to credit or transfer cash, the Custodian shall be liable to the Fund: (a) with respect to Principal Accounts, for interest to be calculated at the rate customarily paid on such deposit and currency by the Custodian on overnight deposits at the time the delay occurs for the period from the day when the transfer should have been effected until the day it is in fact effected; and, (b) with respect to Agency Accounts, for interest to be calculated at the rate customarily paid on such deposit and currency by the Subcustodian on overnight deposits at the time the delay occurs for the period from the day when the transfer should have been effected until the day it is in fact effected. The Custodian shall not be liable for delays in carrying out such Instructions to transfer cash which are not due to the Custodian’s own negligence or willful misconduct.

^^***Advances***. If, for any reason in connection with this Agreement the Custodian or any Subcustodian makes an Advance to facilitate settlement or otherwise for the benefit of the Fund (whether or not any Principal or Agency Account shall be overdrawn either during, or at the end of, any Business Day (defined as any day other than a day on which any of the Futures Exchanges upon which a Benchmark Component Futures Contract is traded is closed for regular trading), the Trust, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Fund, and the Sponsor each hereby does:

7.6.1 acknowledge that the Fund shall have no right, title or interest in or to any Investments purchased with such Advance or proceeds of such Investments, and that any credit to an account of Fund shall be provisional, until: (a) the debit of the Principal or Agency Account by Custodian for an amount equal to Advance Costs; and/or (b) if such debit produces an overdraft in such account, reimbursement to the Custodian or Subcustodian for the amount of such overdraft;

7.6.2 acknowledge that the Custodian has an automatically perfected statutory security interest in Investments purchased with any such Advance (as defined in Section 13) pursuant to Section 9-206 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York from time to time;

“Futures Exchanges” shall include the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”), ICE Futures (“ICE”), Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”), Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”), London Metal Exchange (“LME”), Commodity Exchange, Inc.

^^***Custodian’s Rights***. Neither the Custodian nor any Subcustodian shall be obligated to make any Advance or to allow an Advance to occur to the Fund, and in the event that the Custodian or any Subcustodian does make or allow an Advance, any such Advance and any transaction giving rise to such Advance shall be for the account and risk of the Fund and shall not be deemed to be a transaction undertaken by the Custodian for its own account and risk. If such Advance shall have been made or allowed by a Subcustodian or any other person, the Custodian may assign all or part of its security interest referenced above and any other rights granted to the Custodian hereunder to such Subcustodian or other person. If the Fund shall fail to repay the Advance Costs when due, the Custodian or its assignee, as the case may be, shall be entitled to a portion of the available cash balance in any Agency or Principal Account equal to such Advance Costs, and the Trust and Sponsor authorizes the Custodian, on behalf of the Fund, to pay an amount equal to such Advance Costs irrevocably to such Subcustodian or other person, and to dispose of any property in such Account to the extent necessary to make such payment. Any Investments and funds credited to accounts subject to this Agreement created pursuant hereto shall be treated as financial assets credited to securities accounts under Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York from time to time. Accordingly, the Custodian and any Subcustodian shall have the rights and benefits of a secured creditor that is a securities intermediary under such Articles 8 and 9.

For purposes hereof, deposits maintained in all Principal Accounts (whether or not denominated in United States Dollars) shall collectively constitute a single and indivisible current account with respect to the Fund’s obligations to the Custodian or its assignee, and balances in the Principal Accounts shall be available for satisfaction of the Fund’s obligations under this Section 7.

In the event that Investments or moneys of the Fund remain in the custody of the Custodian or its Subcustodians after the date of termination owing to the failure of the Trust or the Sponsor to issue Instructions with respect to their disposition or owing to the fact that such disposition could not be accomplished in accordance with such Instructions despite diligent efforts of the Custodian, the Custodian shall be entitled to compensation for its services with respect to such Investments and moneys during such period as the Custodian or its Subcustodians retain possession of such items and the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until disposition in accordance with this Section is accomplished.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused this Agreement to be duly executed as of the date first above written.

\centered **FUNDS TRANSFER SERVICES SCHEDULE**

\centered **(“FTSS”)**

In accordance with Section 4.2 of the Custodian Agreement, the Trust, on behalf of itself and the Fund, and the Sponsor acknowledge the following terms and conditions in respect of all funds transfers effected by the Custodian. Terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings accorded to them in the Custodian Agreement.

^**Transmission of Payment Orders**. Each funds transfer Instruction (“**FT Instruction**”) shall be transmitted by such secured or authenticated means and subject to such security procedures as the Custodian shall make available to the Trust and the Sponsor from time to time (such transmission method and security procedures, a **Custodian Designated Security Procedure**), unless the Trust or the Sponsor shall elect to transmit such FT Instruction in accordance with a Fund Designated Security Procedure (as defined in Section 4 below). The Trust and the Sponsor acknowledge and agree that the Custodian will use the security procedures referenced in Sections 3 and 4 below solely to authenticate a FT Instruction, as set forth herein, and not to detect any errors or omissions therein.

^Custodian Designated Security Procedure. The Custodian will make the following Custodian Designated Security Procedures available to the Trust and the Sponsor for use in communicating FT Instructions to the Custodian:

·   **BBH Worldview® Payment Products**. The Custodian offers to the Trust and the Sponsor use of its BBH Worldview Payment Products (“BBH Worldview”), which are Custodian proprietary on-line payment order authorization facilities with built-in authentication procedures. The Custodian, the Trust and the Sponsor shall each be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords or other codes used by them in connection with BBH Worldview. The Custodian will act on FT Instructions received through BBH Worldview without duty of further confirmation unless the Trust or the Sponsor notifies the Custodian that its password is not secure. The Trust and the Sponsor agree that access to, and use of, BBH Worldview shall be governed by an Electronic and On-line Services Schedule, which the Trust, on behalf of itself and the Fund, and the Sponsor will execute prior to access to BBH Worldview.

·   **SWIFT Transmission**. The Custodian, the Trust and the Sponsor shall comply with SWIFT’s authentication procedures. The Custodian will act on FT Instructions received via SWIFT provided the instruction is authenticated by the SWIFT system.

·   **Written Instructions**. Instructions may be transmitted in an original writing that bears the manual signature of an Authorized Person(s).

^**Fund Designated Security Procedure**. FT Instructions may be transmitted through such other means, and subject to such additional security procedures, as may be elected on behalf of the Fund by the Sponsor (or by an Authorized Person entitled to give Instructions) and acknowledged and accepted by the Custodian (the transmission methods and security procedures referenced below, as may be supplemented by such additional security procedures, each a **Fund Designated Security Procedure**); it being understood that the Custodian’s acknowledgment shall authorize it to accept such means of delivery but shall not represent a judgment by the Custodian as to the reasonableness or security of the means utilized by the Trust and the Sponsor.

·   **Computer Transmission**. The Custodian is able to accept transmissions sent from the Trust or the Sponsor’s computer facilities to the Custodian’s computer facilities. If the Trust or the Sponsor determines to use its proprietary transmission or other electronic transmission method, it must provide Custodian sufficient notice and information to allow testing or other confirmation that FT Instructions received via the Fund Designated Security Procedure can be processed in good time and order. The Custodian may require the Trust and the Sponsor to execute additional documentation prior to the use of such transmission method.

·   **Facsimile Transmission**. A FT Instruction transmitted to the Custodian by facsimile transmission must be transmitted by the Trust or the Sponsor to a telephone number specified from time to time by the Custodian for such purposes. The Custodian will then follow one of the procedures below:

^^^If the facsimile requests a non-repetitive order, the Custodian will call the Trust and the Sponsor and request to speak to a person authorized to validate orders on behalf of the Fund and the Sponsor, and confirm the authorization and details of the payment order (a **Callback**);

^^^If the facsimile FT Instruction pertains to a repetitive payment order (see Section 7 below), the Custodian may (at its sole discretion) perform a Callback. Each of the Trust, on behalf of itself and the Fund, and the Sponsor acknowledges that prior to its issuance of any repetitive payment order, it must (a) request that the appropriate repetitive payment order process be approved and set up at the Custodian, and (b) complete such documentation as may be required by the Custodian, including a PPO (as defined in Section 7).

The Custodian shall rely on the purported identity of the originator but due to the lack of reliability of a facsimile signature, it will not perform signature verification on facsimiles.

·   **Telephonic**. The Trust or the Sponsor may call a telephonic payment order into the Custodian at the telephone number designated from time-to-time by the Custodian for that purpose. The caller shall identify herself/himself as an Authorized Person. The Custodian shall obtain the FT Instruction details from the caller. The Custodian shall then follow one of the procedures below:

^^^If the telephonic FT Instruction pertains to a non-repetitive payment order, the Custodian will perform a Callback; or

^^^If the telephonic FT Instruction pertains to a repetitive payment order (see Section 7 below), the Custodian may (at its sole discretion) perform a Callback. The Trust and the Sponsor acknowledge that prior to its issuance of any repetitive payment order, it must (a) request that the appropriate repetitive payment order process be approved and set up at the Custodian, and (b) complete such documentation as may be required by the Custodian, including a PPO.

In electing to transmit a FT Instruction via a Fund Designated Security Procedure, the Trust and the Sponsor (i) agrees to be bound by the transaction(s) or payment order(s) specified on said FT Instruction, whether or not authorized, and accepted by the Custodian in compliance with such Fund Designated Security Procedure, and (ii) accepts the risk associated with such Fund Designated Security Procedure and confirms it is commercially reasonable for the transmission and authentication of the FT Instruction.

The parties agree that the transmission by the Sponsor or the Trust of a FT Instruction by means of any of the above Fund Designated Security Procedures and the Custodian’s acceptance and execution of such FT Instruction shall constitute a FT Instruction sent via a Fund Designated Security Procedure and governed by the terms of this FTSS.

^**Rejection of Payment Orders; Rescission of Designated Security Procedure**. The Custodian shall give the Trust and the Sponsor timely notice of the Custodian’s rejection of a FT Instruction. Such notice may be given in writing, via a Custodian Designated Security Procedure or any Fund Designated Security Procedure used by the Trust and the Sponsor, or orally by telephone, each of which is hereby deemed commercially reasonable. In the event the Custodian fails to execute a properly executable FT Instruction and fails to give the Trust and the Sponsor notice of the Custodian’s non-execution, the Custodian shall be liable only for the actual damages of the Trust, the Fund or the Sponsor and only to the extent that such damages are recoverable under UCC 4A (as defined in Section 13 below). The Custodian, after providing prior written notice, may decide to no longer accept a particular Fund or Custodian Designated Security Procedure, or to do so only on revised terms, in the event that it determines that such agreed or established method of transmission represents a security risk or is attendant to any general change in the Custodian’s policy regarding FT Instructions. Notwithstanding anything in this FTSA and the Agreement to the contrary, the Custodian shall in no event be liable for any consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages under this FTSA, whether or not such damages relate to services covered by UCC 4A, even if the Custodian was advised of the possibility of such damages.

^**Cancellation of Payment Orders**. The Trust and the Sponsor may cancel a FT Instruction but the Custodian shall have no liability for the Custodian’s failure to act on a cancellation FT Instruction unless the Custodian has received such cancellation FT Instruction at a time and in a manner affording the Custodian reasonable opportunity to act prior to the Custodian’s execution of the original FT Instruction. Any cancellation FT Instruction shall be sent and confirmed by such means as is set forth in Section 3 or 4 above.

^**Preauthorized Repetitive Payment Orders**. The Trust and the Sponsor may establish with the Custodian a process to preauthorize certain repetitive payments or transfers. The Trust and the Sponsor will execute all documentation required by the Custodian, including a separate Preauthorized Repetitive Payment Order (**PPO**) form. The PPO shall be delivered to the Custodian in writing or by another Custodian Designated Security Procedure or Fund Designated Security Procedure, and will become effective after the Custodian shall have had a reasonable opportunity to act thereon (or if later, two (2) banking days after receipt by the Custodian). The PPO may take the form of either:

^^^A standing instruction in which the Trust and the Sponsor provides in the PPO all required information for a FT Instruction (except for the transfer date and amount) on a “standing instructions” basis. The Trust and the Sponsor may from time-to-time instruct the Custodian to make a payment under the PPO, in writing or another Custodian Designated Security Procedure or Fund Designated Security Procedure, which instruction shall reference the repetitive line number (a number assigned to it by the Custodian after execution of the PPO), details of the payment, the transfer date and the amount of the transfer; or

^^^A recurring instruction in which the Trust and the Sponsor supplies all required information for a FT Instruction with an instruction to process such payments with a specific frequency.

^**Responsibility for the Detection of Errors in Payment Orders; Liability of the Parties**. The purpose of any Fund Designated Security Procedure or Custodian Designated Security Procedure is to confirm the authenticity of any FT Instruction and is not designed to detect errors or omissions in such FT Instructions. Therefore, the Custodian is not responsible for detecting any Trust and/or Sponsor error or omission contained in any FT Instruction received by the Custodian. In the event that the FT Instruction either (i) identifies the beneficiary by both a name and an identifying account number and the name and number identify different persons or entities, or (ii) identifies the beneficiary by both a name and an identifying number and the number identifies a person or entity different from the beneficiary identified by name, execution of the relevant payment order, payment to the beneficiary, cancellation of the payment order or actions taken by the Custodian or the Trust and the Sponsor in respect of such payment order may be made solely on the basis of the number.

The Custodian shall not be liable for interest on the amount of any FT Instruction that was not authorized or was erroneously executed unless the Trust and the Sponsor so notifies the Custodian within thirty (30) days following the Trust and the Sponsor’s receipt of notice that such FT Instruction was processed. Any compensation payable in the form of interest shall be payable in accordance with UCC 4A. If a FT Instruction in the name of the Fund and the Sponsor and accepted by the Custodian was not authorized by the Trust and/or the Sponsor, the liability of the parties will be governed by the applicable provisions of UCC 4A.
