^an involuntary termination by the Company without Cause;

^a voluntary termination by Executive for Good Reason;

^Executive’s death; or

^Executive’s Disability;

the Accrued Benefit Percentage will be [[Percentage 2]]%, calculated as if Executive continued to be employed through the end of the Accrual Period.

^^The payments and benefits under this Program constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to the application of Section 409A of the Code. The payment of such amounts is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent applicable, this Program shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of this Program to the contrary, the Company may adopt such amendments to this Program or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Company determines are necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the compensation and benefits payable under this Program from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of such compensation and benefits, or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance; provided, however, that no such amendments or adoption of other policies and procedures will reduce the amount of any compensation or benefit Executive otherwise would be entitled to under this Program without the written consent of Executive. Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, designate the taxable year of a payment made under this Program. Any right to a series of installment payments pursuant to this Program is to be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. Any amount that is paid as a short-term deferral within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), or within the involuntary separation pay limit under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) shall 

Execution Copy

be treated as a separate payment. Payment dates provided for in this Program shall be deemed to incorporate “grace periods” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.

^^In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Program, no Supplemental Retirement Benefit, shall be paid to Executive during the 6-month period following Executive’s Separation from Service if the Company determines that paying such amounts at the time or times indicated in this Program would be a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code. If the payment of any such amounts is delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then on the first business day following the end of such 6-month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid under Section 409A of the Code without resulting in a prohibited distribution, including as a result of Executive’s death), the Company shall pay Executive a lump-sum amount equal to the cumulative amount that would have otherwise been payable to Executive during such period. 

^^Acceleration of Payments. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon the occurrence of (i) a Change in Control of the Company that is also a “change in control event” within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-3(i)(5), (ii) the Executive’s death or (iii) the Executive’s Disability, any of which occurs prior to the Benefit Commencement Date, the Company will pay to Executive in a lump sum on the date of the Change in Control, death or Disability, the Actuarial Equivalent of 144 monthly benefit payments, commencing on the Benefit Commencement Date, equal to the Supplemental Retirement Benefit that would be payable to Executive on the Benefit Commencement Date had a Change of Control, death or Disability not occurred, calculated as if Executive continued to be employed through the end of the Accrual Period. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company that is also a “change in control event” within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-3(i)(5), which occurs after the Benefit Commencement Date, this Agreement will terminate and the Actuarial Equivalent of any remaining monthly benefit payments will be paid in a lump sum on the date of the Change in Control.

^^Change in Control Definition. For purposes of this Section, a “**Change in Control**” of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) there shall be consummated (x) any consolidation or merger of the Company into or with another “person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “**Exchange Act**”)) pursuant to which shares of the Company’s common stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property, other than any consolidation or merger of the Company in which the persons who were stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the consummation of such consolidation or merger are the beneficial owners (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), immediately following the consummation of such consolidation or merger, of [[Percentage 7: Number]]% or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the person surviving or resulting from such consolidation or merger, or (y) any sale, lease or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (ii) the stockholders of the Company approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or (iii) any person shall become the beneficial owner of [[Percentage 8: Number]]% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock; or (iv) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the entire board of directors of the Company cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof unless the election, or the nomination for election by the Company’s

stockholders, of each new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of the period.

^Prohibition on Assignments. No part of the Supplemental Retirement Benefit shall be liable for the debts, contracts or engagements of Executive or his successors in interest, or be taken in execution by levy, attachment or garnishment or by any other legal or equitable proceeding, nor shall any such person have any right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber or assign any Supplemental Retirement Benefit or any interest therein in any manner whatsoever.

^Unfunded Obligations of Company. The obligations of Company under the Program shall be unfunded and unsecured, and nothing contained herein shall be construed as providing for assets to be held in trust or escrow or any other form of segregation of the assets of Company for the benefit of Executive or any other person. The interest of Executive or any other person hereunder shall be limited to the right to receive the Supplemental Retirement Benefit as set forth herein. To the extent that Executive or any other person acquires a right to receive any benefit under the Program, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of Company. For tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA, this Program is intended to qualify as an unfunded plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees, and shall be interpreted accordingly. No action by the Company, its Board of Directors, or the Claims Administrator under this Program shall be construed as creating a trust, escrow or other secured or segregated fund or other fiduciary relationship of any kind in favor of any Participant or Beneficiary or any other persons otherwise entitled to benefits under the Program. The status of the Participant and any Beneficiary with respect to any liabilities assumed by the Company hereunder shall be solely that of unsecured creditors of the Company. The Program constitutes a mere promise by the Company to make benefit payments in the future. Any insurance policy or any other asset acquired or held by the Company in connection with liabilities assumed by it hereunder, shall not be deemed to be held under any trust, escrow or other secured or segregated fund or other fiduciary relationship of any kind for the benefit of a Participant or Beneficiary or to be security for the performance of the obligations of the Company, but shall be, and remain a general, unpledged, unrestricted asset of the Company at all times subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company. Inclusive of the foregoing, the Company may transfer assets, including any informal funding vehicles, to a grantor trust of the type known as a “Rabbi Trust” with the Company as grantor and owner of such trust.

^Administrative Provisions. Company shall be the administrator of the Program and shall administer the Program in accordance with the terms of the Program and ERISA.

^^Company shall have the discretion, power and authority: (i) to engage actuaries, attorneys, accountants, or other firms or persons and to rely upon the reports or advice of such persons except as otherwise required by law and (ii) to delegate any duty, power or responsibility to any firm or other person engaged under clause (i) or to any other person or persons.

^^This Program shall be administered, interpreted and applied fairly and equitably by the Company in its discretion and in accordance with the specified purposes of this

Program. All discretionary determinations by Company shall be binding upon all parties, to the maximum extent permitted by law. Company shall be the named fiduciary of this Program.

^Successors and Assigns. This Program shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns. Executive may not assign Executive rights or delegate Executive’s duties under this Program either in whole or in part without the prior written consent of Company.

No modification of or amendment to this Program, nor any waiver of any rights under this Program, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the party to be charged. The failure by either party to enforce any rights hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of such party.

^Severability. If any provision of this Program shall be held or deemed to be invalid, inoperative or unenforceable, such circumstances shall not affect the validity of any other provision of this Program.

^Application for Benefits.

^^Claim for Benefits. If Executive, Executive’s surviving spouse or Beneficiary, as the case may be (the **“Claimant”**) does not receive timely payment of any benefits which Claimant believes are due and payable under this Program, Claimant may file a claim for Supplemental Retirement Benefit under this Program by notifying the Company in writing, together with such other documents and information as Company may require. Within 90 days following receipt of the claim and all necessary documents and information, Company’s authorized delegate reviewing the claim (the **“Claims Administrator”**) shall furnish the Claimant with written notice of the decision rendered with respect to the claim. The Claims Administrator shall be designated by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors reserves the right to change the Claims Administrator from time to time. Should special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the expiration of the initial 90 day period. The notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which a final decision is expected to be rendered. In no event shall the period of the extension exceed ninety (90) days from the end of the initial 90 day period. 

^^Content of Denial. In the case of a complete or partial denial of the Claimant’s claim, a notice written in a manner calculated to be understood by Claimant shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial, references to the Program provisions upon which the denial is based, a description of any additional information or material necessary for the Claimant to perfect the benefit claim (together with an explanation of why the material or information is necessary), and an explanation of the Program’s claims appeal procedure.

^^Appeals. In order to appeal the decision rendered in connection with the denial of a claim for benefits or with respect to the amount of benefits under this Program, the Claimant must follow the appeal procedures set forth in this Section ?14?(c). The appeal must be made in writing in the case where the claim is expressly rejected, within 60 days after the date of receipt of the notice of the decision with respect to the claim, or in the case where the claim has neither been approved or denied within the applicable period provided in Section ?14?(a) above, within 60 days after the expiration of the period. The Claimant may request that his or her application be given full and fair review by the Named Fiduciary designated by the Board of Directors. The Named Fiduciary shall not be the Claims Administrator nor subordinate to the Claims Administrator. The Board of Directors reserves the right to change the Named Fiduciary from time to time, and to designate a special Named Fiduciary for appeals when deemed necessary. The Claimant may review all pertinent documents and submit issues and comments in writing in connection with the appeal. The decision of the Named Fiduciary shall be made promptly, and not later than 60 days after Company’s receipt of a request for review, unless special circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing) require an extension of time for processing. In such a case, a decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than 120 days after receipt of the request for review. If such an extension of time is required, written notice of the extension and the special circumstances shall be given to the Claimant prior to the expiration of the initial 60 day period. The decision on review shall be in writing and shall
