At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented by proxy, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or, if after adjournment a new record date is set, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

SECTION 7. **Organization**. At each meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the Board, if one shall have been elected, or, in his absence or if one shall not have been elected, the Chief Executive Officer shall act as chairman of the meeting.

^^on the date fixed pursuant to the provisions of Section 14 of Article II of these Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) as the record date for the determination of the stockholders who shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting; or

^^if no such record date shall have been so fixed, then at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice thereof shall be given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the date next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a proxy which is in writing or transmitted as permitted by law, including, without limitation, electronically, via telegram, internet, interactive voice response system, or other means of electronic transmission executed or authorized by such stockholder or his attorney-in-fact, but no proxy shall be voted after (3) three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Any such proxy shall be delivered to the secretary of the meeting at or prior to the time designated in the order of business for so delivering such proxies.

Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. The inspectors shall determine the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstandin g and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the results, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders. On request of the chairman of the meeting, the inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, request or matter determined by them and shall execute a certificate of any fact found by them. No director or candidate for the office of director shall act as an inspector of an election of directors. Inspectors need not be stockholders.

To be timely, a stockholder’s notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the date of the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event the annual meeting is scheduled to be held on a date more than thirty (30) days prior to or delayed by more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not earlier than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to such annual meeting, and not later than the later of the close of business ninety (90) days prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made.

No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 12; provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 12 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business.

SECTION 13. **Action by Written Consent**. Unless restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, whenever the vote of stockholders at a meeting thereof is required or permitted to be taken for or in connection with any corporate action, by any provision of statute or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, the meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with, and the action taken without such meeting and vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of stock of the Corpora tion entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. The consent shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, or the Corporation’s principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book or books in which the proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation’s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; provided, however, that no consent delivered by certified or registered mail shall be deemed delivered until such consent is actually received at the Corporation’s registered office. All consents properly delivered in accordance with this Section 13 shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixt y (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as required by this Section 13, written consents signed by the holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. Any action taken pursuant to such written consent of the stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the stockholders at a meeting thereof.

^**Fixing the Record Date**. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitl ed to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. Such notice shall specify the action proposed to be consented to by stockholders. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events wi thin ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation. Such delivery to the Corporation shall be made to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation. Such delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt reque sted. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

In the event of delivery to the Corporation of a written consent or written consents purporting to authorize or take corporate action, and/or related revocation or revocations, (each such written consent and related revocation, individually and collectively, a “Consent”), the Secretary of the Corporation shall provide for the safekeeping of such Consent and shall as soon as practicable thereafter conduct such reasonable investigation as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining the validity of such Consent and all matters incident thereto, including, without limitation, whether holders of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in the Consent have given consent. If after such investigatio n the Secretary shall determine that the Consent is sufficient and valid, that fact shall be certified on the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of the stockholders, and the Consent shall be filed in such records, at which time the Consent shall become effective as stockholder action.
