^**RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTING CONDITIONS**

Any apparent inconsistency between Federal statutes and regulations and the terms and conditions contained in this award must be referred to the DOE Award Administrator for guidance.

^**AWARD PROJECT PERIOD AND BUDGET PERIOD**

The Period of Performance for this Award is sixty (60) months from the effective date. The project start date will be **[[Date 2: Date]]**. Project implementation shall not exceed thirty-six (36) months. The balance of the Period of Performance will be for data collection activities.

^**PAYMENT PROCEDURES -REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH THE AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE (ACH) VENDER INQUIRY PAYMENT ELECTRONIC REPORTING SYSTEM (VIPERS)**

^^Method of Payment. Payment will be made by reimbursement through ACH.

^^Requesting Reimbursement. Requests for reimbursements must be made electronically through Department of Energy's [[Address 2: Address]] Center (ORFSC) VIPERS. To access and use VIPERS, you must enroll at https://finweb.oro.doe.gov/vipers.htm. Detailed instructions on how to enroll are provided on the web site.

You must submit a Standard Form (SF) 270, "Request for Advance or Reimbursement" at https://finweb.oro.doe.gov/vipers.htm and attach a file containing appropriate supporting documentation. The file attachment must show the total federal share claimed on the SF 270, the non-federal share claimed for the billing period, and cumulative expenditures to date (both Federal and non-Federal) for each of the following categories: salaries/wages and fringe benefits; equipment; travel; participant/training support costs, if any; other direct costs, including subawards/contracts; and indirect costs.

^^Timing of submittals. Submittal of the SF 270 should coincide with your normal billing pattern, but not more frequently than every two weeks. Requests for reimbursement must be limited to the amount of disbursements made during the billing period for the federal share of direct project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs incurred during that billing period.

^^Adjusting payment requests for available cash. You must disburse any funds that are available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of those funds before requesting additional cash payments from DOE.

^^Payments. The DOE approving official will approve the invoice as soon as practicable but not later than 30 days after your request is received, unless the billing is improper. Upon receipt of an invoice payment authorization from the DOE approving official, the ORFSC will disburse payment to you. You may check the status of your payments at the VIPER web site. All payments are made by electronic funds transfer to the bank account identified on the ACH Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form (SF 3881) that you filed.

^**MAXIMUM OBLIGATION**

The maximum obligation of the DOE is limited to the amount shown on the Agreement Face Page. You are not obligated to continue performance of the project beyond the total amount obligated and your pro rata share of the project costs.

\centered For Official Use Only

\centered For Official Use Only

^**COST SHARING FFRDC’S NOT INVOLVED**

^^Total Estimated Project Cost is the sum of the Government share and Recipient share of the estimated project costs. The Recipient's cost share must come from non-Federal sources unless otherwise allowed by law. By accepting federal funds under this award, you agree that you are liable for your percentage share of total allowable project costs, even if the project is terminated early or is not funded to its completion. This cost is shared as follows:

Government Share   \centered Recipient Share   Total Estimated Cost
$ / %   \centered $ / %
$[[USD Value 3: Number]]/ [[Percentage 1: Number]]%   \centered $[[USD Value 3]]/ [[Percentage 1]]%   $[[USD Value 4: Number]]

^^If you discover that you may be unable to provide cost sharing of at least the amount identified in paragraph a of this article, you should immediately provide written notification to the DOE Award Administrator indicating whether you will continue or phase out the project. If you plan to continue the project, the notification must describe how replacement cost sharing will be secured.

^^You must maintain records of all project costs that you claim as cost sharing, including in-kind costs, as well as records of costs to be paid by DOE. Such records are subject to audit.

^^Failure to provide the cost sharing required by this Clause may result in the subsequent recovery by DOE of some or all the funds provided under the award.

^**REBUDGETING AND RECOVERY OF INDIRECT COSTS – REIMBURSABLE INDIRECT COSTS AND FRINGE BENEFITS**

^^If actual allowable indirect costs are less than those budgeted and funded under the award, you may use the difference to pay additional allowable direct costs during the project period. If at the completion of the award the Government's share of total allowable costs (i.e., direct and indirect), is less than the total costs reimbursed, you must refund the difference.

^^Recipients are expected to manage their indirect costs. DOE will not amend an award to provide additional funds for changes in indirect cost rates. DOE recognizes that the inability to obtain full reimbursement for indirect costs means the Recipient must absorb the under recovery. Such under recovery may be allocated as part of the organization's required cost sharing.

^**PRE-AWARD COSTS (As Applicable)**

Any work performed prior to the effective date of award stated on the Agreement Face Page is done at the recipient's risk. You are able to recoup costs incurred on or after [[Date 3: Date]], that are otherwise allowable. All pre-award costs must be in accordance with the applicable Federal Cost principles referenced in 10 C.F.R. 600.

^**USE OF PROGRAM INCOME – COST SHARING**

If you earn program income during the project period as a result of this award, you may use the program income to meet your cost sharing requirement.

^**STATEMENT OF FEDERAL STEWARDSHIP**

DOE will exercise Federal stewardship in overseeing the project activities performed under this award. Stewardship activities include, but are not limited to, conducting site visits; reviewing performance and financial reports; providing technical assistance and/or temporary intervention in unusual circumstances to correct deficiencies which develop during the project; assuring compliance with terms and conditions; and reviewing technical performance after project completion to ensure that the award objectives have been accomplished.

\centered For Official Use Only

\centered For Official Use Only

^**SITE VISITS**

DOE's authorized representatives have the right to make site visits at reasonable times to review project accomplishments and management control systems and to provide technical assistance, if required. You must provide, and must require your subawardees to provide, reasonable access to facilities, office space, resources, and assistance for the safety and convenience of the government representatives in the performance of their duties. All site visits and evaluations must be performed in a manner that does not unduly interfere with or delay the work.

The DOE will be provided reasonable access to Recipient facilities to verify the installation, configuration, and operational status of the components, devices, facilities, and systems being installed under this award. The DOE shall request access reasonably in advance and shall be accompanied by representative(s) of the Recipient.

^**REPORTING REQUIREMENTS**

The reporting requirements for this award are identified on the Federal Assistance Reporting Checklist, DOE F 4600.2, attached to this award. Failure to comply with these reporting requirements is considered a material noncompliance with the terms of the award. Noncompliance may result in withholding of future payments, suspension, or termination of the current award. A willful failure to perform, a history of failure to perform, or unsatisfactory performance may also result in a debarment action to preclude future awards by Federal agencies.

^**PUBLICATIONS**

If you publish or otherwise make publicly available the results of the work conducted under the award, an acknowledgment of Federal support and a disclaimer must appear in the publication of any material, whether copyrighted or not, based on or developed under this project, as follows:

\centered For Official Use Only

\centered For Official Use Only

^**PROPERTY**

Real property and equipment acquired by the Recipient shall be subject to the rules set forth in 10 CFR 600.321.

Consistent with the goals and objectives of this project, the Recipient may continue to use real property and equipment purchased in whole or in part with Federal funds under this award for its authorized purpose beyond the Period of Performance without obligation to make payment to DOE to extinguish DOE's interest to such property as described in 10 CFR 600.321, subject to the following: (a) the Recipient continues to utilize such property for the objectives of the project as set forth in the Statement of Project Objectives; (b) DOE retains the right to periodically ask for, and the Recipient agrees to provide, reasonable information concerning the use and condition of the property; and (c) the Recipient follows the property disposition rules set forth in 10 CFR 600.321 if the property is no longer used by the Recipient for the objective s of the project, and the fair market value of property exceeds $[[USD Value 5: Number]]

Once the per unit fair market value of the property is less than $[[USD Value 6: Number]] pursuant to 10 CFR 600.321(f)(l)(i), DOE's interest in the property shall be extinguished and Recipient shall have no further obligation to the DOE with respect to the property.

Consistent with the 10 C.F.R. §§ 600.132(a), 600.134(c), and 600.321(b)(2), a recipient may request that the DOE contracting officer consider approving encumbrance of real property and equipment purchased in whole or in part with Federal funds under the award.

^**INSOLVENCY, BANKRUPTCY OR RECEIVERSHIP**

^^You shall immediately notify the DOE of the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) you or your parent's filing of a voluntary case seeking liquidation or reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act; (ii) your consent to the institution of an involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Act against you or your parent; (iii) the filing of any similar proceeding for or against you or your parent, or its consent to, the dissolution, winding-up or readjustment of your debts, appointment of a receiver, conservator, trustee, or other officer with similar powers over you, under any other applicable state or federal law; or (iv) your insolvency due to your inability to pay your debts generally as they become due.

^^Such notification shall be in writing and shall: (i) specifically set out the details of the occurrence of an event referenced in paragraph a; (ii) provide the facts surrounding that event; and (iii) provide the impact such event will have on the project being funded by this award.

^^Upon the occurrence of any of the four events described in the first paragraph, DOE reserves the right to conduct a review of your award to determine your compliance with the required elements of the award (including such items as cost share, progress towards technical project objectives, and submission of required reports). If the DOE review determines that there are significant deficiencies or concerns with your performance under the award, DOE reserves the right to impose additional requirements, as needed to institute payment controls.

^^Failure of the Recipient to comply with this provision may be considered a material noncompliance of this financial assistance award by the Contracting Officer.

^**NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT (NEPA) REQUIREMENTS**

The project proposed and approved by DOE as detailed in this award is categorically excluded from National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements. However, if the project changes or is 

\centered For Official Use Only

\centered For Official Use Only

supplemented your work associated with the new activity is restricted from taking any action using Federal funds, which would have an adverse effect on the environment or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives prior to DOE providing either a NEPA clearance or a final NEPA decision regarding this project.

If you move forward with activities that are not authorized for federal funding by the DOE Contracting Officer in advance of the final NEPA decision, you are doing so at risk of not receiving federal funding and such costs may not be recognized as allowable cost share.

^**FINAL INCURRED COST AUDIT**

In accordance with 10 CFR 600, DOE reserves the right to initiate a final incurred cost audit on this award. If the audit has not been performed or completed prior to the closeout of the award, DOE retains the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.

^**SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO WORK FUNDED UNDER AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (MAR 2009)**

Preamble  
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-5, (Recovery Act) was enacted to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery, assist those most impacted by the recession, provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health, invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits, stabilize State and local government budgets, in order to minimize and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive State and local tax increases. Recipients shall use grant funds in a manner that maximizes job creation and economic benefit.

The Recipient shall comply with all terms and conditions in the Recovery Act relating generally to governance, accountability, transparency, data collection and resources as specified in Act itself and as discussed below.

Recipients should begin planning activities for their first tier subrecipients, including obtaining a DUNS number (or updating the existing DUNS record), and registering with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

Be advised that Recovery Act funds can be used in conjunction with other funding as necessary to complete projects, but tracking and reporting must be separate to meet the reporting requirements of the Recovery Act and related guidance. For projects funded by sources other than the Recovery Act, Contractors must keep separate records for Recovery Act funds and to ensure those records comply with the requirements of the Act.

The Government has not fully developed the implementing instructions of the Recovery Act, particularly concerning specific procedural requirements for the new reporting requirements. The Recipient will be provided these details as they become available. The Recipient must comply with all requirements of the Act. If the Recipient believes there is any inconsistency between ARRA requirements and current award terms and conditions, the issues will be referred to the Contracting Officer for reconciliation.

Definitions  
For purposes of this clause, Covered Funds means funds expended or obligated from appropriations under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-5. Covered Funds will have special accounting codes and will be identified as Recovery Act funds in the grant, cooperative agreement or TIA and/or modification using Recovery Act funds. Covered Funds must be reimbursed by [[Date 4: Date]].

\centered For Official Use Only

\centered For Official Use Only

Non-Federal employer means any employer with respect to covered funds --the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or Recipient, as the case may be, if the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or Recipient is an employer; and any professional membership organization, certification of other professional body, any agent or licensee of the Federal government, or any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer receiving covered funds; or with respect to covered funds received by a State or local government, the State or local government receiving the funds and any contractor or subcontractor receiving the funds and any contractor or subcontractor of the State or local government; and does not mean any department, agency, or other entity of the federal government.

Recipient means any entity that receives Recovery Act funds directly from the Federal government (including Recovery Act funds received through grant, loan, or contract) other than an individual and includes a State that receives Recovery Act Funds.

Special Provisions  
^Flow Down Requirement

Recipients must include these special terms and conditions in any subaward.

^Segregation of Costs

Recipients must segregate the obligations and expenditures related to funding under the Recovery Act. Financial and accounting systems should be revised as necessary to segregate, track and maintain these funds apart and separate from other revenue streams. No part of the funds from the Recovery Act shall be commingled with any other funds or used for a purpose other than that of making payments for costs allowable for Recovery Act projects.

^Prohibition on Use of Funds

None of the funds provided under this agreement derived from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-5, may be used by any State or local government, or any private entity, for any casino or other gambling establishment, aquarium, zoo, golf course, or swimming pool.

^Access to Records

With respect to each financial assistance agreement awarded utilizing at least some of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-5, any representative of an appropriate inspector general appointed under section 3 or 8G of the Inspector General Act of 1988 (5 U.S.C. App.) or of the Comptroller General is authorized --

^to examine any records of the contractor or grantee, any of its subcontractors or subgrantees, or any State or local agency administering such contract that pertain to, and involve transactions that relate to, the subcontract, subcontract, grant, or subgrant; and

^to interview any officer or employee of the contractor, grantee, subgrantee, or agency regarding such transactions.

^Publication

An application may contain technical data and other data, including trade secrets and/or privileged or confidential information, which the applicant does not want disclosed to the public or used by the Government for any purpose other than the application. To protect such data, the applicant should specifically identify each page including each line or paragraph thereof containing the data to be protected and mark the cover sheet of the application with the following Notice as well as referring to the Notice on each page to which the Notice applies:

\centered For Official Use Only

Notice of Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data

The data contained in pages ----of this application have been submitted in confidence and contain trade secrets or proprietary information, and such data shall be used or disclosed only for evaluation purposes, provided that if this applicant receives an award as a result of or in connection with the submission of this application, DOE shall have the right to use or disclose the data here to the extent provided in the award. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use or disclose data obtained without restriction from any source, including the applicant.

Information about this agreement will be published on the Internet and linked to the website www.recovery.gov, maintained by the Accountability and Transparency Board.

^Protecting State and Local Government and Contractor Whistleblowers.

The requirements of Section 1553 of the Act are summarized below. They include, but are not limited to:

Prohibition on Reprisals: An employee of any non-Federal employer receiving covered funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-5, may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing, including a disclosure made in the ordinary course of an employee's duties, to the Accountability and Transparency Board, an inspector general, the Comptroller General, a member of Congress, a State or Federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, a person with supervisory authority over the employee (or other person working for the employer who has the authority to investigate, discover or terminate misconduct), a court or grand jury, the head of a Federal agency, or their representatives information that the employee believes is evidence of:

-gross mismanagement of an agency contract or grant relating to covered funds;

-a gross waste of covered funds; 

-a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety related to the implementation or use of covered funds;

-an abuse of authority related to the implementation or use of covered funds; or

-as violation of law, rule, or regulation related to an agency contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract) or grant, awarded or issued relating to covered funds.

Agency Action: Not later than 30 days after receiving an inspector general report of an alleged reprisal, the head of the agency shall determine whether there is sufficient basis to conclude that the non-Federal employer has subjected the employee to a prohibited reprisal. The agency shall either issue an order denying relief in whole or in part or shall take one or more of the following actions:

-Order the employer to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.

-Order the employer to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with compensation including back pay, compensatory damages, employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.

-Order the employer to pay the employee an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expert witnesses' fees) that were reasonably incurred by the employee for or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Nonenforceablity of Certain Provisions Waiving Rights and remedies or Requiring Arbitration: Except as provided in a collective bargaining agreement, the rights and remedies provided to aggrieved employees by this section may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment, including any predispute arbitration agreement. No predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable if it requires arbitration of a dispute arising out of this section.

Requirement to Post Notice of Rights and Remedies: Any employer receiving covered funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-5, shall post notice of the rights and remedies as required therein. (Refer to section 1535 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-5, www.Recovery.gov, for specific requirements of this section and prescribed language for the notices).

^WAGE RATE REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTION 1606 OF THE RECOVERY ACT (As Applicable)

^^Section 1606 of the Recovery Act requires that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors on projects funded directly by or assisted in whole or in part by and through the Federal Government pursuant to the Recovery Act shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on projects of a character similar in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code.

Pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 14 and the Copeland Act, 40 U.S.C. 3145, the Department of Labor has issued regulations at 29 CFR parts 1,3, and 5 to implement the Davis-Bacon and related Acts. Regulations in 29 CFR 5.5 instruct agencies concerning application of the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses set forth in that section. Federal agencies providing grants, cooperative agreements, and loans under the Recovery Act shall ensure that the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses found in 29 CFR 5.5(a) are incorporated in any resultant covered contracts that are in excess of $[[USD Value 8: Number]] for construction, alteration or repair (including painting and decorating).

^^For additional guidance on the wage rate requirements of section 1606, contact your awarding agency. Recipients of grants, cooperative agreements and loans should direct their initial inquiries concerning the application of Davis-Bacon requirements to a particular federally assisted project to the Federal agency funding the project. The Secretary of Labor retains final coverage authority under Reorganization Plan Number 14.

^RECOVERY ACT TRANSACTIONS LISTED IN SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS AND RECIPIENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR INFORMING SUBRECIPIENTS

^^To maximize the transparency and accountability of funds authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111--5) (Recovery Act) as required by Congress and in accordance with 2 CFR 215.21 "Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements" and OMB Circular A--­102 Common Rules provisions, recipients agree to maintain records that identify adequately the source and application of Recovery Act funds. OMB Circular A--102 is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a102/al02.html.

^^For recipients covered by the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and OMB Circular A--133, "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations," recipients agree to separately identify the expenditures for Federal awards under the Recovery Act on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) and the Data Collection Form (SF--SAC) required by OMB Circular A--133. OMB Circular A--133 is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a133/a133.html.This shall be accomplished by identifying expenditures for Federal awards made under the Recovery Act separately on the SEFA, and as separate rows under Item 9 of Part III on the SF--SAC by CFDA number, and inclusion of the prefix "ARRA-" in identifying the name of the Federal program on the SEFA and as the first characters in Item 9d of Part III on the SF—SA C.

^^**Davis Bacon Act** 
^Minimum wages. 
^^^All laborers and mechanics employed or working upon the site of the work (or under the United States Housing Act of 1937 or under the Housing Act of 1949 in the construction or development of the project), will be paid unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and, without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR part 3)), the full amount of wages and bona fide fringe benefits (or cash equivalents thereof) due at time of payment computed at rates not less than those contained in the wage determination of the Secretary of Labor regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the Contractor and such laborers and mechanics.

Contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(I)(iv) of this section; also, regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period (but not less often than quarterly) under plans, funds, or programs which cover the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such weekly period. Such laborers and mechanics shall be paid the appropriate wage rate and fringe benefits on the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed, without regard to skill, except as provided in § 5.5(a)(4). Laborers or mechanics performing work in more than one c lassification may be compensated at the rate specified for each classification for the time actually worked therein, provided that the employer's payroll records accurately set forth the time spent in each classification in which work is performed. The wage determination (including any additional classification and wage rates conformed under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section) and the Davis-Bacon poster (WH-1321) shall be posted at all times by the Contractor and its subcontractors at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place where it can be easily seen by the workers.

(ii)(A) The Contracting Officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics, including helpers, which is not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the Contract shall be classified in conformance with the wage determination. The Contracting Officer shall approve an additional classification and wage rate and fringe benefits therefore only when the following criteria have been met:

^The work to be performed by the classification requested is not performed by a classification in the wage determination;

^The classification is utilized in the area by the construction industry; and

^The proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe benefits, bears a reasonable relationship to the wage rates contained in the wage determination.

^If the Contractor and the laborers and mechanics to be employed in the classification (if known), or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer agree on the classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits where appropriate), a report of the action taken shall be sent by the contracting officer to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, [[Address 4: Address]]. The Administrator, or an authorized representative, will approve, modify, or disapprove every additional classification action within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary.

^In the event the Contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the classification or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer do not agree on the proposed classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), the Contracting Officer shall refer the questions, including the views of all interested parties and the recommendation of the Contracting Officer, to the Administrator for determination. The Administrator, or an authorized representative, will issue a determination within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30­day period that additional time is necessary.

^The wage rate (including fringe benefits where appropriate) determined pursuant to paragraphs (a)(l)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, shall be paid to all workers performing work in the classification under this Contract from the first day on which work is performed in the classification.

^^^Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the Contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly rate, the Contractor shall either pay the benefit as stated in the wage determination or shall pay another bona fide fringe benefit or an hourly cash equivalent thereof.

^^^If the Contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, the Contractor may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing bona fide fringe benefits under a plan or program, provided that the Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the Contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the Contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.

^Withholding. The Department of Energy or the Recipient or Subrecipient shall upon its own action or upon written request of an authorized representative of the Department of Labor withhold or cause to be withheld from the Contractor under this Contract or any other Federal contract with the same prime contractor, or any other federally-assisted contract subject to Davis­ Bacon prevailing wage requirements, which is held by the same prime contractor, so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics, including apprentices, trainees, and helpers, employed by the Contractor or any subcontractor the full amount of wages required by the Contract. In the event of failure to pay any laborer or mechanic, including any apprentice, trainee, or helper, employed or working on the site of the work (or under the United States Housing Act of 1937 or under the Housing Act of 1949 in the construction or development of the project), all or part of the wages required by the Contract, the Department of Energy, Recipient, or Subrecipient, may, after written notice to the Contractor, sponsor, applicant, or owner, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment, advance, or guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased.

^Payrolls and basic records. 
^^^Payrolls and basic records relating thereto shall be maintained by the Contractor during the course of the work and preserved for a period of three years thereafter for all laborers and mechanics working at the site of the work (or under the United States Housing Act of 1937, or under the Housing Act of 1949, in the construction or development of the project). Such records shall contain the name, address, and social security number of each such worker, his or her correct classification, hourly rates of wages paid (including rates of contributions or costs anticipated for bona fide fringe

benefits or cash equivalents thereof of the types described in section 1(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act), daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made, and actual wages paid. Whenever the Secretary of Labor has found under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv) that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program described in section 1(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act, the Contractor shall maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in providing such benefits. Contractors emplo ying apprentices or trainees under approved programs shall maintain written evidence of the registration of apprenticeship programs and certification of trainee programs, the registration of the apprentices and trainees, and the ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable programs.

^^^(A) The Contractor shall submit weekly for each week in which any Contract work is performed a copy of all payrolls to the Department of Energy if the agency is a party to the Contract, but if the agency is not such a party, the Contractor will submit the payrolls to the Recipient or Subrecipient (as applicable), applicant, sponsor, or owner, as the case may be, for transmission to the Department of Energy. The payrolls submitted shall set out accurately and completely all of the information required to be maintained under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)(i), except that full social security numbers and home addresses shall not be included on weekly transmittals. Instead, the payrolls shall only need to include an individually identifying number for each employee (e.g., the last four digits of the employee's social security number). The required weekly payroll information may be submitted in any form desired. Optional Form WH-347 is available for this purpose from the Wage and Hour Division Web site at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/forms/wh347instr.htm or its successor site. The prime Contractor is responsible for the submission of copies of payrolls by all subcontractors. Contractors and subcontractors shall maintain the full social security number and current address of each covered worker, and shall provide them upon request to the Department of Energy if the agency is a party to the Contract, but if the agency is not such a party, the Contractor will submit them to the Recipient or Subrecipient (as applicable), applicant, sponsor, or owner, as the case may be, for transmission to the Department of Energy, the Contractor, or the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor for purposes of an investigation or audit of compliance with prevailing wage requirements. It is not a violation of this section for a prime contractor to require a subcontractor to provide addresses and social security numbers to the pri me contractor for its own records, without weekly submission to the sponsoring government agency (or the Recipient or Subrecipient (as applicable), applicant, sponsor, or owner).

^Each payroll submitted shall be accompanied by a "Statement of Compliance," signed by the Contractor or subcontractor or his or her agent who pays or supervises the payment of the persons employed under the Contract and shall certify the following:

^That the payroll for the payroll period contains the information required to be provided under § 5.5 (a)(3)(ii) of Regulations, 29 CFR part 5, the appropriate information is being maintained under § 5.5 (a)(3)(i) of Regulations, 29 CFR part 5, and that such information is correct and complete;

^That each laborer or mechanic (including each helper, apprentice, and trainee) employed on the Contract during the payroll period has been paid the full weekly wages earned, without rebate, either directly or indirectly, and that no deductions have been made either directly or indirectly from the full wages

\centered For Official Use Only

\centered For Official Use Only

earned, other than permissible deductions as set forth in Regulations, 29 CFR part 3;

^That each laborer or mechanic has been paid not less than the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits or cash equivalents for the classification of work performed, as specified in the applicable wage determination incorporated into the Contract.

^The weekly submission of a properly executed certification set forth on the reverse side of Optional Form WH-347 shall satisfy the requirement for submission of the "Statement of Compliance" required by paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.

^The falsification of any of the above certifications may subject the Contractor or subcontractor to civil or criminal prosecution under section 1001 of title 18 and section 3729 of title 31 of the United States Code.

^^^The Contractor or subcontractor shall make the records required under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section available for inspection, copying, or transcription by authorized representatives of the Department of Energy or the Department of Labor, and shall permit such representatives to interview employees during working hours on the job. If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to submit the required records or to make them available, the Federal agency may, after written notice to the Contractor, sponsor, applicant, or owner, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment, advance, or guarantee of funds. Furthermore, failure to submit the required records upon request or to make such records available may be grounds for debarment action pursuant to 29 CFR 5.12.

^Apprentices and trainees­ 
^^^Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they performed when they are employed pursuant to and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office, or if a person is employed in his or her first 90 days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an apprenticeship program, who is not individually registered in the program, but who has been certified by the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services or a State Apprenticeship Agency (where appropriate) to be eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen on the job site in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to the entire work force under the registered program. Any worker listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not registered or otherwise employed as stated above, shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed. In addition, any apprentice performing work on the job site in excess of the ratio permitted under the registered program shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the work actually performed. Where a Contractor is performing construction on a project in a locality other than that in which its program is registered, the ratios and wage rates (expressed in percentages of the journeyman's hourly rate) specified in the Contractor's or subcontractor's registered program shall be observed. Every apprentice must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the registered program for the apprentice's level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the journeymen hourly rate specified in the applicable wage determination. Apprentices shall be paid fringe benefits in accordance with the provisions of the apprenticeship program. If the apprenticeship program does not specify fringe benefits, apprentices must be paid the full amount of fringe benefits listed on the wage determination for the applicable classification. If the Administrator determines that a different practice prevails for the applicable apprentice classification, fringes shall be paid in accordance with that determination. In the event the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor

Services, or a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office, withdraws approval of an apprenticeship program, the Contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize apprentices at less than the applicable predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable program is approved.

^^^Trainees. Except as provided in 29 CFR 5.16, trainees will not be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work performed unless they are employed pursuant to and individually registered in a program which has received prior approval, evidenced by formal certification by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration. The ratio of trainees to journeymen on the job site shall not be greater than permitted under the plan approved by the Employment and Training Administration. Every trainee must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the approved program for the trainee's level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the journeyman hourly rate specified in the applicable wage determination. Trainees shall be paid fringe benefits in accordance with the provisions of the trainee progra m. If the trainee program does not mention fringe benefits, trainees shall be paid the full amount of fringe benefits listed on the wage determination unless the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division determines that there is an apprenticeship program associated with the corresponding journeyman wage rate on the wage determination which provides for less than full fringe benefits for apprentices. Any employee listed on the payroll at a trainee rate who is not registered and participating in a training plan approved by the Employment and Training Administration shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed. In addition, any trainee performing work on the job site in excess of the ratio permitted under the registered program shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the work actually performed. In the event the Employment and Training Administration withdraws approval of a training p rogram, the Contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize trainees at less than the applicable predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable program is approved.

^^^Equal employment opportunity. The utilization of apprentices, trainees, and journeymen under this part shall be in conformity with the equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended and 29 CFR part 30.

\centered Section 3 –Tailoring Strategy

This section should document how the PEP requirements will be met through a tailored application of project management and project controls.

Tailoring is a flexible approach that allows appropriate levels of effort or analytical rigor to be used in fulfilling all requirements. Tailoring does not mean waiving requirements, nor does it imply the omission of essential elements in the acquisition process.

\centered Section 4 -Project Baseline

^^Performance Management Baseline (PMB)

The PMB is a time-phased budget plan for accomplishing work, against which performance is measured. It includes the budgets assigned to scheduled control accounts and the applicable indirect budgets. The PMB should represent the monetized value of all work expected to be accomplished under the project. It represents the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) element in the online web-based Project Management Reporting System.

Technical performance parameters and deliverables should define key features of the project and how it/they will perform when completed at Project Close Out including characteristics (quantity, size, etc.), functions, requirements, or the design basis that, if changed, would have a major impact on system or facility performance. It includes all costs for both Federal and recipient.

**4.1.1 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary**

The WBS is the product-oriented grouping of project elements that organize and define the total scope of the project. A WBS Dictionary is a listing of WBS elements with a short description of the work scope content in each element. The Dictionary helps ensure consistent understanding and use of the WBS elements among all of the WBS users.

Provide WBS Level 2 and WBS Dictionary listing of work breakdown structure elements with a short description of the work scope content in each element. For the purposes of the PEP due to DOE, WBS Levell should be the project that the SGIG grant is funding, e.g., Smart Grid West Virginia.

**4.1.2 Integrated Schedule** 
The integrated schedule should display duration and linkages of the various tasks required to accomplish the project and should display the project's critical path. Preferentially the integrated schedule will be provided as a Gantt chart with the task identified and planned start and completion dates listed.

^^List of Major Project Milestones 
Provide a list of the major project milestones. Examples of the types of major milestones could be the completion of design for communications architecture, initiation of Phase I meter installation, and receipt of state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) approval. The list should describe the milestone and the planned milestone date. If using an early start/late start milestone planning approach, identify which date.

^ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT

\centered For Official Use Only

\centered For Official Use Only

The Recipient and the Department of Energy (DOE) understand that the Recipient’s project scope, budget and project execution plan are based on the assumption that the Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) funds provided by DOE will be considered nontaxable income under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 118(a). As of the date of this Agreement, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has not yet issued guidance or otherwise made a determination regarding the applicability of IRC 118(a) under the SGIG program. For this reason and so that the Recipient is not prejudiced by an IRS determination following the execution of this Agreement, the process set out below will be followed in the circumstances described:

^In the event the IRS declines to issue guidance by [[Date 8: Date]] providing that some or all of SGIG grant funds may be treated as nontaxable income under IRC 118(a) under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Recipient may elect to reopen this Agreement for negotiation as provided for below.

^In the event IRS determines that terms and conditions which differ from those contained in this Agreement would permit all or some of the SGIG funds to be treated as nontaxable income and in the event DOE offers to modify the standard terms and conditions for other SGIG recipients in order to cause all or some portion of the SGIG grant funds to be treated by IRS as nontaxable capital contributions, the DOE Contracting Officer shall notify the Recipient of the proposed modification(s).

^Within the earliest of (i) thirty calendar days after delivery of a notification by DOE that the IRS has advised that the IRS has declined to issue guidance providing that some or all of SGIG grant funds may be treated as nontaxable income under IRC 118(a); (ii) fourteen calendar days after the date of notice from the Contracting Officer of a modification of the Agreement provided for in (B) above to support treatment as nontaxable capital contributions; or (iii) by [[Date 9: Date]] if IRS has failed to issue guidance by [[Date 8]], the Recipient shall notify the DOE Contracting Officer and Technical Project Officer as to whether the Recipient elects (1) to proceed with the project as planned, or (2) to reopen this Agreement (including the scope of the project) for negotiation to reflect impacts to the project. If Recipient elects to reo pen this Agreement for negotiations, DOE and Recipient shall dedicate authorized representatives to negotiate in good faith.

^If the parties have not satisfactorily concluded negotiations after a period of sixty calendar days: (i) DOE may elect to terminate such negotiations; (ii) Recipient may elect to terminate such negotiations and may, but shall not be required to, terminate this Agreement in its entirety in accordance with 10 C.F.R. § 600.351(a) (3).

\centered **Instructions for the SF-424A**  Public Reporting Burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 3.0 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Please do not return your completed form to the Office of Management and Budget, send it to the address provided by the sponsoring agency.

**General Instructions** This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget, adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments. In the later case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and Section E should present the nee d for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B. Section A. Budget Summary Lines 1-4 Columns (a) and (b) For applications pertaining to a **single** Federal grant program (Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog number) and **not requiring** a functional or activity breakdown, enter on Line 1 under Column (a) the catalog program title and the catalog number in Column (b).

^Special Instructions:   
Other Reporting: 

**Details regarding the data elements set forth below are provided in the "Guidebook for ARRA Smart Grid Program Metrics and Benefits", or ***Guidebook,*** dated [[Date 10: Date]]***,*** 2009, provided separately.**

^Reporting of Cumulative Jobs Created/Retained

•   For the first six months of this award the Recipient must report the data specified in this section on a monthly basis beginning with the quarter of the effective date of the award. After the six month period the reporting frequency shall be quarterly unless the Office of Management and Budget authorizes continued monthly reporting.

•   Recipient will provide the data required in this section via a mutually agreed upon format and media to DOE.

•   Recipients will report the cumulative number of jobs directly created or retained by project and activity or contract. Recipients will be required to report these direct jobs numbers by labor categories, as provided below:

•   Managers

•   Engineers

•   Computer-related Occupations

•   Environmental and Social Scientists

•   Construction, Electrical and Other Trades

•   Analysts,

•   Business Occupations

•   Recording, Scheduling, Computer Operator Occupations

•   A job created is a new position created and filled or an existing unfilled position that is filled as a result of the Recovery Act; a job retained is an existing position that would not have been continued to be filled were it not for Recovery Act funding. A job cannot be counted as both created and retained. Also, only compensated employment in the United States or outlying areas should be counted. See 74 FR 14824 for definitions.

•   The estimate of the number of jobs required by the Recovery Act should be expressed as "full-time equivalents" (FTE), which is calculated as total hours worked in jobs created or retained divided by the number of hours in a full-time schedule, defined here as 2,080 hours per calendar year. The FTE estimates must be reported cumulatively each calendar quarter.

•   Prime recipients of these grants must include in the aggregate number an estimate of jobs created and retained on projects and activities managed by their funding sub-recipients (including prime and sub-prime contractors).

•   Recipients will have the option to report on the employment impact on materials and equipment suppliers and central service providers (so-called "indirect" jobs). Employees who are not directly charged to Recovery Act supported projects/activities, who, nonetheless, provide critical indirect support are considered indirect jobs created/retained. Recipients will not be required to report on the employment impact on the local community ("induced" jobs).

•   The requirement for reporting jobs is based on a simple calculation used to avoid overstating the number of other than full-time, permanent jobs. This calculation converts part-time or temporary jobs into "full-time equivalent" (FTE) jobs. In order to perform the calculation, a recipient will need the total number of hours worked that are funded by the Recovery Act by category and the total number of hours worked for the entire project by labor category. The number of hours in a full-time schedule for a quarter will equal 520 (one-quarter of 2,080).

The two formulas for reporting Cumulative Jobs Created/Retained are represented as:

"Cumulative Recovery Act Funded Hours Worked (qtr l...n)" divided by

"cumulative hours in a full-time schedule"

"Cumulative Total Project Hours Worked (qtr l...n)" divided by

"cumulative hours in a full-time schedule"

^Reporting Requirements for Metrics and Benefits

The recipient is required to report Build Metrics on a quarterly basis and Impact Metrics and Benefits on a semi-annual basis following the award date. Baseline data will be provided as specified within the Metrics and Benefits Reporting Plan. The recipient will provide this information in a mutually agreed upon format and media to a location identified by DOE.

^Reporting Requirements for Consumer Behavior Studies

**Special Note: This section only applies to recipients who proposed in their application submitted in response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement Number DE-FOA-0000058 to conduct a consumer behavior study with control and randomized treatment groups**

C.1 Evaluation Reports 

Participating recipients shall submit a comprehensive interim Evaluation Report, within 360 days following commencement of the Consumer Behavior Study, and a final Evaluation report at completion of the study, as specified in the Consumer Behavior Study Plan. Participating recipients shall submit a draft of both the interim and final Evaluation Reports to DOE and make a good faith effort to address issues raised by DOE in the final version of the Evaluation Reports. The Evaluation Reports shall include at a minimum:

^Overview of the project, including its goals;

^Description of how the project was designed and implemented to achieve these goals;

^Synopsis of the evaluation framework and methodology; and

^Summary of the results and lessons learned.

The Final Evaluation Report will be made available to the public; confidential information should not be included. C.2 Provision of Project Data

The recipient shall be responsible for submitting comprehensive data that was used, or served as the foundation, for the analysis of the dynamic pricing with randomization project, as defined within the Consumer Behavior Study Plan. Please refer to Appendix D of the Guidebook. The recipient will provide customer-level data in a mutually agreed upon formal and media to DOE, or an entity designated by DOE (e.g. a national laboratory). It is expected that the data provided to DOE shall have gone through the necessary quality assurance processes internal to the recipient in order to ensure the data is accurate and complete. This data shall be consistent with requirements outlined in the final submitted Consumer Behavior Study Plan.

The data will be publicly available for subsequent analysis and evaluation for those interested in assessing and better understanding the impacts that dynamic pricing enabled by the smart grid can have on customer behavior. The identity of specific customers shall not be included with the data. To protect customer confidentiality, masked customer identifiers shall be provided for individual customers.

It is expected that the data will include at a minimum the following data elements for each customer: 1) hourly interval data for electric consumption, tariff pricing (i.e., retail rate level in effect), and weather; 2) customer characteristics (as described in Appendix D of the Guidebook); and 3) hourly electricity usage data for 12-18 months prior to the dynamic pricing project.
