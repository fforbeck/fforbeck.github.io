At all times prior to the closure of the Key Accounts, the Borrowers shall immediately transfer funds in the Key Accounts in excess of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] in the aggregate to an account with Silicon Valley Bank or another financial institution which has a control agreement in favor of Asahi.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at all times prior to the Release Date, Asahi agrees that (i) to the extent any Borrower maintains any Deposit Account, Securities Account or commodity account with a financial institution other than Silicon Valley Bank, such Borrower shall only be required to provide and maintain control agreements for the benefit of Asahi if and to the extent that the Borrower is required to provide and maintain such agreements for the benefit of Silicon Valley Bank, and (ii) any control agreement executed and delivered in favor of Asahi shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Asahi in its reasonable discretion. In addition, from and after the Release Date, no Borrower will, directly or indirectly, establish any new Deposit Account or Securities Account without prior written notice to Asahi except for (i) accounts used exclusively for payroll or other employment or tax related payments, (ii) accounts holding cash collateral for letters of credit contemplated by the definition of Permitted Liens, (iii) controlled disbursement accounts held at Silicon Valley Bank; provided that each such account has a daily balance of zero as of the end of each day, and (iv) other accounts holding no more than $[[USD Value 4: Number]] in the aggregate, of cash, Investment Property, Securities or other assets.

“7.1      **Generally.** As security for the payment and performance of the Obligations, and without limiting any other grant of a Lien and security interest in any Security Document, each Borrower hereby grants and pledges to Asahi, for the benefit of Asahi, a continuing Lien on and security interest in, upon, and to the personal property set forth on Schedule 7.1 attached hereto and made a part hereof.”

^Section 7.2(b) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 

“(b) (i) Prior to the Release Date: No Collateral (other than (A) Field Equipment maintained with any Borrower’s customers and/or end users of such Field Equipment, and (B) other assets with a value of not more than $[[USD Value 2]] at any location) shall at any time be in the possession or control of any warehouse, consignee, bailee or any of any Borrower’s agents or processors without prior written notice to Asahi. If any Borrower intends to deliver any portion of the Collateral (other than (x) Field Equipment maintained with any Borrower’s customers and/or end users of such Field Equipment, and (y) other assets with a value of not more than $[[USD Value 2]] at any location) to a location, and Asahi and such warehouseman, consignee or bailee are not already parties to a warehouse, consignee or bailee agreement governing both the Collateral and the location to which such Borrower intends to deliver the Collateral, then such Borrower will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Asahi a signed warehouse, consignee or bailee agreement, as applicable, in form and substance satisfactory to Asahi in its reasonable discretion, provided that prior to the Release Date, Borrower shall only be required to provide warehouse receipts, consignment agreements or bailee waivers (as applicable) for the benefit of Asahi to the extent that such warehouse receipts, consignment agreements or bailee waivers (as applicable) are required to be provided to Silicon Valley Bank pursuant to the SVB Loan Agreement.

NxStage shall, upon the request of Asahi, notify any such warehouse, consignee, bailee, agent or processor of the security interests and Liens in favor of Asahi created pursuant to this Agreement and the Security Documents, instruct such Person to hold all such Collateral for Asahi’s account subject to Asahi’s instructions (or, in the case of any Permitted Lien on such Collateral, subject to the instructions of the holder of such Permitted Lien in accordance with any intercreditor agreement or subordination agreement executed by Asahi and the holder of such Permitted Lien) and shall obtain an acknowledgement from such Person that such Person holds the Collateral for Asahi’s benefit (and, in the case of any Permitted Lien on such Collateral, for the benefit of the holder of such Permitted Lien in accordance with any intercreditor agreement or subordination agreement executed by Asahi and the holder of such Permitted Lien).”

^Section 7.2(f) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following at the end thereof: 

“Prior to the Release Date, if any Borrower shall acquire a commercial tort claim in excess of $[[USD Value 1]] such Borrower shall promptly notify Asahi in a writing signed by the applicable Borrower of the general details thereof and grant to Asahi in such writing a security interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Asahi. In addition, each Borrower shall at any time and from time to time execute any further instruments and take further action as Asahi may reasonably request to perfect or continue Asahi’s Lien in the Collateral as contemplated by this Agreement.” 

^The following new Section 7.4 is inserted into the Loan Agreement, immediately following Section 7.3 thereof: 

**“7.4**      **Release of SVB Priority Collateral.** On the Release Date, Asahi’s security interest in, and Liens on, any Collateral not constituting Original Collateral shall automatically be released and Asahi’s Liens and security interests shall automatically extend solely to the Original Collateral. Promptly upon receipt from Borrowers of release and discharge documentation evidencing the termination of SVB’s liens on the Collateral, as provided herein, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Asahi, Asahi and, to the extent applicable, the Borrowers shall enter into such documentation, including without limitation, UCC termination statements, intellectual property filings, releases and discharge documents, which are reasonably necessary to effectuate such release, all at the sole cost and expense of the Borrowers. For the avoidance of debt, Asahi and the Borrowers agree that the first priority perfected Liens on, and security interest of Asahi in, the Original Collateral shall at all times remain in full force and effect, notwithstanding any release by Asahi of the any collateral which is not Original Collateral.”
