**WHEREAS**, on [[Date 2: Date]], the Company issued a demand Promissory Note to Schutte in an aggregate principal amount of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] (the “Note”), $[[USD Value 2: Number]] of which was satisfied on [[Date 3: Date]];

**WHEREAS**, Schutte has agreed to forbear the payment of all accrued but unpaid interest on the Notes through the date of this Agreement;

^^Subsequent to the date of this Agreement, if the Company receives an offer to purchase its equity securities from a potential investor (the “Potential Investor”), it shall promptly provide written notice to Schutte including the price and other terms and conditions of such offering (the “Offering Notice”). For fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Offering Notice, Schutte shall have the option to sell the Conversion Shares to the Potential Investor in the proposed offering at the price and on the terms and conditions stated in the Offering Notice. Schutte may exercise such option by delivering to the Potential Investor the stock certificate evidencing ownership of the Conversion Shares along with a stock power executed in blank and such other documentation that the Potential Investor or the Company’s transfer agent may reasonably request, in exchange for a cash payment equal to the number of Conversion Shares multiplied by the price per share set forth in the Offering Notice, provided that, if the Offering Notice is dated earlier than the six (6) month anniversary of this Agreement, then Schutte shall only deliver to the Potential Investor an irrevocable proxy to vote the Conversion Shares and the final sale of the Conversion Shares, including the tender of the stock certificate evidencing ownership of the Conversion Shares, the executed stock power and other documentation by Schutte, shall not occur until one (1) day after the six (6) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement.
