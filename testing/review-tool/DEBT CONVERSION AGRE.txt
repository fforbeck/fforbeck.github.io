^The Company issued to the Debt Holder a Promissory Note dated [[Date 2: Date]] in the original principal amount of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] (the “Note”) pursuant to terms which are described on Schedule 1 hereto (the “Obligation”). 

^The Company is considering conducting a public offering of shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $[[USD Value 3: Number]] per share (the “Common Stock”), to raise additional capital pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement (File No. 333-165445) (the “Registration Statement”) on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and has retained Roth Capital Partners as placement agent for such offering (the “Public Offering”). 

^In order to facilitate the Company’s ability to raise additional equity capital in the Public Offering, subject to the occurrence and effective as of the Closing, the Debt Holder and the Company desire that the Debt Holder exchange the Note (including the entire principal balance of the Obligation and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon) for shares of Common Stock on the terms and conditions set forth herein and, in connection therewith, to release all claims held by the Company or the Debt Holder against the other party with respect to the Obligation and the payment of principal and interest thereon. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the mutual covenants, agreements, representations and warranties hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, do agree as follows:
