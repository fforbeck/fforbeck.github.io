\centered **INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT**

This Indemnification Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made and entered as of June ___, 2010 by and between [[Company]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]], f/k/a K-Kitz, Inc., with its principal place of business at 600 Cruiser Lane, Belgrade, Montana 59714 (the “Company”), and ________________________________ (“Indemnitee”) and the parties agree as follows:

^**Services by Indemnitee**. Indemnitee agrees to serve as a director of the Company so long as he is duly appointed or elected and qualified in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company and until such time as he resigns or fails to stand for election or is removed from his position. Indemnitee may, at any time and for any reason, resign or be removed from such position (subject to any other contractual obligation or other obligation imposed by operation of law), in which event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue Indemnitee in any such position.

^**Indemnification**.  

^^Subject to the limitations set forth herein and in Sections 2(b) and 4 below, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against Expenses and Liabilities in connection with any Proceeding (as hereinafter defined in Section 13) associated with Indemnitee’s being a director of the Company to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation or the bylaws of the Company in effect on the date hereof or as such law, Articles of Incorporation or bylaws may from time to time be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than the law, the Articles of Incorporation or the bylaws permitted the Company to provide before such amendment). The right to indemnification provided in the Company’s bylaws shall be presumed to have been relied upon by Indemnitee in serving or continuing to serve the Company and shall be enforceable as a contract right. Without diminishing the scope of the indemnification provided by this Section 2, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee whenever he is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding, including without limitation any such Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company, because he is or was a director of the Company or because of anything done or not done by him in such capacity, against Expenses and Liabilities actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding, including the costs of any investigation, defense, settlement or appeal. In addition to, and not as a limitation of, the foregoing, the rights of indemnification of Indemnitee provided under this Agreement shall include those rights set forth in Sections 3, 7, 8, and 12 below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall only be required to indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless in connection with a Proceeding commenced by Indemnitee (other than a Proceeding commenced by Indemnitee to enforce Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement) if the commencement of such Proceeding was authorized by the board of directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”).

^^Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to continue to indemnify Indemnitee with respect to:

^^^any claim, issue or matter after Indemnitee is finally adjudged to be liable to the Company by a court of competent jurisdiction due to gross negligence, fraud, knowing violation of the law or willful misconduct unless and to the extent that a court in which the action was heard determines that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for such amounts as the court deems proper; provided, that until such time as a final adjudication is made as to Indemnitee’s gross negligence, fraud, knowing violation of law or willful misconduct, the Company shall advance Indemnitee his Expenses in accordance with Section 3 herein, subject to repayment as described in Section 3 in the event of a final adjudication of gross negligence, fraud, knowing violation of law or willful misconduct;

^^^the reporting or accounting of profits made (1) for an improper personal profit without full and fair disclosure to the Company of all material conflicts of interest and not approved thereof by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors, or (2) from the purchase or sale by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, or similar provisions of any state statutory or common law;

^^^any attempt to acquire, or obtain voting rights with respect to, at least fifty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the then outstanding voting stock of the Company, whether by tender offer, proxy solicitation or otherwise, if (a) Indemnitee attempted to acquire or obtain voting rights with respect to such stock or was or became a member of a group consisting of two or more persons that had agreed (whether formally or informally and whether or not in writing) to act together for the purpose of acquiring, obtaining voting rights with respect to, holding, voting or disposing of, such stock, and (b) such attempt to acquire or obtain voting rights with respect to such stock was not approved by a majority of the directors of the Company, for purposes of determining whether any tender offer, proxy solicitation or other transaction constituted an attempt by Indemnitee, or a group (as described above) of which Indemnitee was or became a member, to acquire or obtain voting rights with respect to at least fifty percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the then outstanding voting stock of the Company, there shall be counted toward the request number of shares of voting stock any shares which, immediately prior to the commencement of such tender offer, proxy solicitation or other transaction, (x) were owned by Indemnitee or any member of any such group, (y) Indemnitee or any member of any such group had the right to vote, or (z) Indemnitee or any member of any such group had the right to acquire;

^^^any solicitation of proxies by Indemnitee, or by a group of which he was or became a member consisting of two or more persons that had agreed (whether formally or informally and whether or not in writing) to act together for the purpose of soliciting proxies, in opposition to any solicitation of proxies approved by the Company’s Board of Directors;

^^^any act or omission by Indemnitee that constitutes a breach of or default under any agreement between Indemnitee and the Company; or

^^^to the extent it would be otherwise prohibited by law, if so established by a court having jurisdiction in the matter in a judgment or other final adjudication (and, in this respect, both the Company and Indemnitee have been advised that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission believes that indemnification for liabilities arising under the federal securities laws is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable).

^^Indemnitee shall be paid promptly by the Company all amounts necessary to effectuate the indemnity described in Section 2(a).

^**Advancement of Expenses**. All reasonable Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee shall be advanced from time to time by the Company to him within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Company of a written request for an advance of Expenses, whether prior to or after final disposition of a proceeding (except to the extent that there has been a Final Adverse Determination that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such Expenses), including without limitation any proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company; provided, however, that Indemnitee shall not be entitled to the advancement of expenses in connection with any proceeding relating to his termination by or resignation from the Company or arising out of the circumstances described in Sections 2(b)(ii), 2(b)(iii) or 2(b)(iv). The written request for and advancement of any and all Expenses under this paragraph shall contain reasonable detail of the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and, if required by law at the time of such advance, shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay any Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. If required by law at the time of such advance, Indemnitee hereby agrees to repay any and all Expenses advanced if it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.

^**Additional Limitations**. The foregoing indemnity and advancement of Expenses shall apply only to the extent that Indemnitee has not been indemnified and reimbursed pursuant to such insurance as the Company may maintain for Indemnitee’s benefit, or otherwise; provided, however, that notwithstanding the availability of such other indemnification and reimbursement, Indemnitee may claim indemnification and advancement of Expenses pursuant to this Agreement by assigning to the Company, at its request, Indemnitee’s claims under such insurance to the extent Indemnitee has been paid by the Company.

^**Insurance and Funding**. Within a commercially reasonable time from the date hereof, the Company shall purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and/or Indemnitee against any Expenses and Liabilities in connection with any proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws. The Company may create a trust fund, grant and interest in assets or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification or advancement of Expenses as provided in this Agreement.

^**Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification**.

^^Whenever Indemnitee believes that he is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit a written request for indemnification to the Company. Any request for indemnification shall include sufficient documentation or information reasonably available to Indemnitee to support his claim for indemnification. Indemnitee shall submit his claim for indemnification within a reasonable time not to exceed five years after any judgment, order, settlement, dismissal, arbitration award, conviction, acceptance of a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, final termination or other disposition or partial disposition of any proceeding, whichever is the later date for which Indemnitee requests indemnification. The president or the secretary or other appropriate officer of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of Indemnitee’s request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors of the Company in writing that Indemnitee has made such request. Determination of Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than sixty (60) days after the Company’s receipt of the written request for such indemnification.

^^The majority of disinterested directors, or if such majority does not exist, the full Board of Directors, shall be entitled to select the forum in which Indemnitee’s request for indemnification will be heard, which selection shall be transmitted to the Indemnitee in writing. The forum shall be any one of the following:

^^^The stockholders of the Company;

^^^A quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of disinterested directors;

^^^Independent legal counsel, who shall make the determination in a written opinion; or

^^^A panel of three arbitrators, one selected by the Company, another by Indemnitee and the third by the first two arbitrators selected. If for any reason three arbitrators are not selected within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the first arbitrator, then selection of additional arbitrators shall be made by the American Arbitration Association. If any arbitrator resigns or is unable to serve in such capacity for any reason, the American Arbitration Association shall select such arbitrator’s replacement. The arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association now in effect.

^^Upon making a request for indemnification, Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching any contrary determination. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, arbitration award or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not affect this presumption or, except as provided in Section 2 or 4 hereof, establish a presumption with regard to any factual matter relevant to determining Indemnitee’s rights to indemnification hereunder.

^**Fees and Expenses of Independent Legal Counsel**. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of independent legal counsel or a panel of three arbitrators should such counsel or such panel of arbitrators be retained to make a determination of Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement, and to fully indemnify such counsel arising out of or relating to this Agreement or their engagement pursuant hereto, except with respect to expenses and losses resulting from the negligence or willful misconduct of such persons.

^**Remedies of Indemnitee**.

^^In the event that (i) a determination pursuant to Section 6 hereof is made that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, (ii) advances of Expenses are not made pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 6(b) of this Agreement within 60 days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, or (iv) payment has not been timely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to a final adjudication in any court of competent jurisdiction of his rights. Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 8(a). The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee’s right to seek any such adjudication.

^^In the event that a determination that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, in whole or in part, has been made pursuant to Section 6 hereof, the decision in the judicial proceeding provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 8 shall be made de novo and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of a determination that he is not entitled to indemnification.

^^If a determination that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification has been made pursuant to Section 6 hereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall be bound by such determination in the absence of (i) any misrepresentation of a material fact by Indemnitee or (ii) a specific finding (which has become final) by a court of competent jurisdiction that all or any part of such indemnification is expressly prohibited by Delaware law.

^^In any court proceeding pursuant to this Section 8, the Company shall be precluded from asserting that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable. The Company shall stipulate in any such court that the Company is bound by all provisions of this Agreement.

^**Modification, Waiver, Termination, and Cancellation**. No supplement, modification, termination, cancellation or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

^**Notice by Indemnitee and Defense of Claim**. Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Company in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any matter, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, but the omission to notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee if such omission does not prejudice the Company’s rights. If such omission does prejudice the Company’s rights, the Company will be relieved from liability only to the extent of such prejudice, nor will such omission relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement. With respect to any proceeding as to which Indemnitee notifies the Company of the commencement thereof;

^^The Company will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense; and

^^The Company jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified will be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee; provided, however, that the Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any proceeding if there has been a Change of Control or if Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee with respect to such proceeding. After notice from the Company to Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense thereof, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any Expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ its own counsel in such proceeding but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless;

^^^The employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company;

^^^Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded on the advice of counsel that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee with respect to such proceeding; or

^^^The Company shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense in such proceeding or shall not in fact have assumed such defense and be acting in connection therewith with reasonable diligence; in each of which cases the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Company.

^^The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent. The Company shall not settle any proceeding in any manner which would subject Indemnitee to a penalty or cost without Indemnitee’s written consent. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold its or his consent to any proposed settlement.

^**Notices**. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally or by overnight courier such as Federal Express, or sent by certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed

^**Certain Definitions**.   
^^**“Change in Control”** shall be deemed to have occurred if:

^^^Any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or a corporation owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, hereafter becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than fifty percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the total voting power represented by the Company’s then outstanding voting securities; or

^^^The stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) at least eighty percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or

^^^The stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, provided, however, that any other provision of this Section 13(a) notwithstanding, the term "Change in Control" shall not include a transaction, if undertaken at the election of the Company, the result of which is to sell all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to another corporation (the "surviving corporation"); provided that the surviving corporation is owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the corporation immediately following such transaction in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the Company's common stock immediately preceding such transaction; and provided, further, that the surviving corporation expressly assumes this Agreement.

^^**“Disinterested Director”** shall mean a director of the Company who is not or was not a party to the proceeding in respect of which indemnification is being sought by Indemnitee.

^^“**Final Adverse Determination”** shall mean that a determination that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 6 hereof and either (i) a final adjudication in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof shall have denied Indemnitee’s right to indemnification hereunder, or (ii) Indemnitee shall have failed to file a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section 8(a) for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the determination made pursuant to Section 6 hereof.

^^“**Indemnification Period”** shall mean the period of time during which Indemnitee shall continue to serve as a director of the Company, and thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible proceeding arising out of acts or omissions of Indemnitee as a director of the Company.

This Agreement shall continue in effect during the Indemnification Period, regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as a director.

^**Severability**. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement (or any portion thereof) shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:

^^the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and

^**Attorneys Fees**.
