4.***Administration of the Plan.***  
^^Procedure.  
^^^Multiple Administrative Bodies. The Plan shall be administered by the Board or one or more Committees, including such delegates as may be appointed under paragraph (a)(iv) of this Section 4.

^^^Section 162. To the extent that the Administrator determines it to be desirable to qualify Awards granted hereunder as “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, Awards to “covered employees” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code or Employees that the Committee determines may be “covered employees” in the future shall be made by a Committee of two or more “outside directors” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.

^^^Rule 16b-3. To the extent desirable to qualify transactions hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act (“Rule 16b-3”), Awards to Officers and Directors shall be made in such a manner to satisfy the requirement for exemption under Rule 16b-3.

^^^Other Administration. The Board or a Committee may delegate to an authorized Officer or Officers of the Company the power to approve Awards to persons eligible to receive Awards under the Plan who are not (A) subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act; or (B) at the time of such approval, “covered employees” under Section 162(m) of the Code.

^^Delegation of Authority for the Day-to-Day Administration of the Plan. Except to the extent prohibited by Applicable Law, the Administrator may delegate to one or more individuals the day-to-day administration of the Plan and any of the functions assigned to it in this Plan. Such delegation may be revoked at any time.

^^Powers of the Administrator. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and, in the case of a Committee or delegates acting as the Administrator, subject to the specific duties delegated to such Committee or delegates, the Administrator shall have the authority, in its discretion:

^^^to select the Service Providers of the Company or its Affiliates to whom Awards are to be granted hereunder;

^^^to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each Award granted hereunder;

^^^to determine the type of Award to be granted to the selected Service Provider;

^^^to approve the forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan;

^^^to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Award granted hereunder. Such terms and conditions include the exercise or purchase price, the time or times when an Award may be exercised (which may or may not be based on performance criteria), the vesting schedule, any vesting or exercisability acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, the acceptable forms of consideration, the term, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine and may be established at the time an Award is granted or thereafter;

^^^to correct administrative errors;  
^^^to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan (including sub-plans and Plan addenda) and Awards granted pursuant to the Plan;

^^^to adopt rules and procedures relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrator is specifically authorized (A) to adopt the rules and procedures regarding the conversion of local currency, withholding procedures, and handling of stock certificates that vary with local requirements; and (B) to adopt sub-plans and Plan addenda as the Administrator deems desirable, to accommodate foreign laws, regulations and practice;

^^^to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans and Plan addenda;

^^^to modify or amend each Award, including the acceleration of vesting, exercisability, or both; provided, however, that any modification or amendment of an Award is subject to Section 16 of the Plan and may not materially impair any outstanding Award unless agreed to by the Participant;

^^^to allow Participants to satisfy withholding tax amounts by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued pursuant to an Award that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined in such manner and on such date that the Administrator shall determine or, in the absence of provision otherwise, on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by a Participant to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may provide;

^^^to authorize conversion or substitution under the Plan of any or all stock options, stock appreciation rights, or other stock awards held by service providers of an entity acquired by the Company (the “Conversion Awards”). Any conversion or substitution shall be effective as of the close of the merger or acquisition. The Conversion Awards may be Nonstatutory Stock Options or Incentive Stock Options, as determined by the Administrator, with respect to options granted by the acquired entity. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator at the time of conversion or substitution, all Conversion Awards shall have the same terms and conditions as Awards generally granted by the Company under the Plan;

^^^to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;

^^^to determine whether to provide for the right to receive dividends or dividend equivalents;

^^^to establish a program whereby Service Providers designated by the Administrator can reduce compensation otherwise payable in cash in exchange for Awards under the Plan;

^^^to impose such restrictions, conditions, or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by a Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any Shares issued as a result of or under an Award, including (A) restrictions under an insider trading policy, and (B) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers;

^^^to provide, either at the time an Award is granted or by subsequent action, that an Award shall contain as a term thereof, a right, either in tandem with the other rights under the Award or as an alternative thereto, of the Participant to receive, without payment to the Company, a number of Shares, cash, or both, the amount of which is determined by reference to the value of the Award; and

^^^to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Plan and any Award granted hereunder.

^^Effect of Administrator’s Decision. All decisions, determinations and interpretations by the Administrator regarding the Plan, any rules and regulations under the Plan and the terms and conditions of any Award granted hereunder, shall be final and binding on all Participants. The Administrator shall consider such factors as it deems relevant, in its sole and absolute discretion, to making such decisions, determinations and interpretations, including the recommendations or advice of any officer or other employee of the Company and such attorneys, consultants and accountants as it may select.

^***Eligibility.*** Awards may be granted to Service Providers of the Company or any of its Affiliates.

^***Effective Date and Term of the Plan.*** The Plan shall become effective upon its approval by the stockholders of the Company. It shall continue in effect for a term of ten years from the date of the Plan is approved by the stockholders unless terminated earlier under Section 16 herein.

^***Term of Award.*** The term of each Award shall be determined by the Administrator and stated in the Award Agreement. In the case of an Option, the term shall be ten years from the Grant Date or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.

^***Options.*** The Administrator may grant an Option or provide for the grant of an Option, either from time to time in the discretion of the Administrator or automatically upon the occurrence of specified events, including the achievement of performance goals, and for the satisfaction of an event or condition within the control of the Awardee or within the control of others.

^^Option Agreement. Each Option Agreement shall contain provisions regarding (i) the number of Shares that may be issued upon exercise of the Option; (ii) the type of Option; (iii) the exercise price of the Shares and the means of payment for the Shares; (iv) the term of the Option; (v) such terms and conditions on the vesting or exercisability of an Option, or both, as may be determined from time to time by the Administrator; (vi) restrictions on the transfer of the Option and forfeiture provisions; and (vii) such further terms and conditions, in each case not inconsistent with this Plan, as may be determined from time to time by the Administrator.

^^Exercise Price. The per share exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Administrator, subject to the following:

^^^In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Employee to whom an Incentive Stock Option is granted is a Ten-Percent Stockholder, then the exercise price shall not be less than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date.

^^^In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than [[Percentage 2]]% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date. The per Share exercise price may also vary according to a predetermined formula; provided, that the exercise price never falls below [[Percentage 2]]% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date.

^^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Administrator’s discretion, Conversion Awards may be granted in substitution or conversion of options of an acquired entity, with a per Share exercise price of less than [[Percentage 2]]% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of such substitution or conversion.

^^Vesting Period and Exercise Dates. Options granted under this Plan shall vest, be exercisable, or both, at such times and in such installments during the Option’s term as determined by the Administrator. The Administrator shall have the right to make the timing of the ability to exercise any Option granted under this Plan subject to continued service, the passage of time, or such performance requirements as deemed appropriate by the Administrator. At any time after the grant of an Option, the Administrator may reduce or eliminate any restrictions surrounding any Participant’s right to exercise all or part of the Option.

^^Form of Consideration. The Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment, either through the terms of the Option Agreement or at the time of exercise of an Option. Acceptable forms of consideration may include:

^^^cash;  
^^^check or wire transfer;  
^^^subject to any conditions or limitations established by the Administrator, other Shares that have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender or attestation that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which such Option shall be exercised;

^^^consideration received by the Company under a broker-assisted sale and remittance program acceptable to the Administrator to the extent that this procedure would not violate Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended;

^^^cashless exercise, subject to any conditions or limitations established by the Administrator;

^^^such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws; or

^^^any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.

9.***Incentive Stock Option Limitations*****.**  
^^Eligibility. Only employees (as determined in accordance with Section 3401(c) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) of the Company or any of its Related Corporations may be granted Incentive Stock Options.

^^$[[USD Value 1: Number]] Limitation. Notwithstanding the designation “Incentive Stock Option” in an Option Agreement, if the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Awardee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any of its Related Corporations) exceeds $[[USD Value 2: Number]] then the portion of such Options that exceeds $[[USD Value 1]] shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. An Incentive Stock Option is considered to be first exercisable during a calendar year if the Incentive Stock Option will become exercisable at any time during the year, assuming that any condition on the Awardee’s ability to exercise the Incentive Stock Option related to the performance of services is satisfied. If the Awardee’s ability to exercise the Incentive Stock Option in the year is subject to an acceleration provision, then the Incentive Stock Option is considered first exercisable in the calendar year in which the acceleration provision is triggered. For purposes of this Section 9(b), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. However, because an acceleration provision is not taken into account before its triggering, an Incentive Stock Option that becomes exercisable for the first time during a calendar year by operation of such provision does not affect the application of the $[[USD Value 1]] limitation with respect to any Incentive Stock Option (or portion thereof) exercised before such acceleration. The Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the Grant Date.

^^Leave of Absence. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no leave of absence may exceed three months, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is provided by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company or a Related Corporation is not so provided by statute or contract, an Awardee’s employment with the Company shall be deemed terminated on the first day immediately following such three month period of leave for Incentive Stock Option purposes and any Incentive Stock Option granted to the Awardee shall cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and shall terminate upon the expiration of the three month period following the date the employment relation ship is deemed terminated.

^^Transferability. The Option Agreement must provide that an Incentive Stock Option cannot be transferable by the Awardee otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and, during the lifetime of such Awardee, must not be exercisable by any other person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may allow the Awardee to transfer his or her Incentive Stock Option to a trust where under Section 671 of the Code and other Applicable Law, the Awardee is considered the sole beneficial owner of the Option while it is held in the trust. If the terms of an Incentive Stock Option are amended to permit transferability, the Option will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stoc k Option.

^^Exercise Price. The per Share exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option shall be determined by the Administrator in accordance with Section 8(b)(i) of the Plan.

^^Ten-Percent Stockholder. If any Employee to whom an Incentive Stock Option is granted is a Ten-Percent Stockholder, then the Option term shall not exceed five years measured from the date of grant of such Option.

^^Other Terms. Option Agreements evidencing Incentive Stock Options shall contain such other terms and conditions as may be necessary to qualify, to the extent determined desirable by the Administrator, under the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code.

10.***Exercise of Option.***  
^^Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder.

^^^Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the respective Award Agreement.

^^^An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives (A) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option; (B) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the related Option is exercised; and (C) with respect to Nonstatutory Stock Options, payment of all applicable withholding taxes.

^^^Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Unless provided otherwise by the Administrator or pursuant to this Plan, until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the Shares subject to an Option, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.

^^^The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares as soon as administratively practicable after the Option is exercised. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.

^^Effect of Termination of Service on Options.

^^^Generally. Unless otherwise provided for by the Administrator, if a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant’s death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the vested portion of the Option will remain exercisable for three months following the Participant’s termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant i s not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan. If the Participant is a non-employee Director and ceases to serve on the Board of Directors, any Options held by the Director will not terminate, but shall continue for the remaining term of the Option. If after the Termination of Service the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.

^^^Disability of Awardee. Unless otherwise provided for by the Administrator, if a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant’s Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve months following the Participant’s termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of Disability the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.

^^^Death of Awardee. Unless otherwise provided for by the Administrator, if a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant’s death within such period as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the Option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant’s designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated before the Participant’s death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal represen tative of the Participant’s estate or by the person or persons to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant’s will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve months following Participant’s death. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of death Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.

11.***Stock Awards.***  
^^Stock Award Agreement. Each Stock Award Agreement shall contain provisions regarding (i) the number of Shares subject to such Stock Award or a formula for determining such number; (ii) the purchase price of the Shares, if any, and the means of payment for the Shares; (iii) the performance criteria, if any, and level of achievement versus these criteria that shall determine the number of Shares granted, issued, retained, or vested, as applicable; (iv) such terms and conditions on the grant, issuance, vesting, or forfeiture of the Shares, as applicable, as may be determined from time to time by the Administrator; (v) restrictions on the transferability of the Stock Award; and (vi) such further term s and conditions in each case not inconsistent with this Plan as may be determined from time to time by the Administrator.

^^Restrictions and Performance Criteria. The grant, issuance, retention, and vesting of each Stock Award may be subject to such performance criteria and level of achievement versus these criteria as the Administrator shall determine, which criteria may be based on financial performance, personal performance evaluations, or completion of service by the Awardee.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the performance criteria for any Stock Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements for “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code shall be established by the Administrator based on one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria selected by the Administrator and specified in writing.

^^Forfeiture. Unless otherwise provided for by the Administrator, upon the Awardee’s Termination of Service, the unvested Stock Award and the Shares subject thereto shall be forfeited, provided that to the extent that the Participant purchased any Shares pursuant to such Stock Award, the Company shall have a right to repurchase the unvested portion of such Shares at the original price paid by the Participant.

^^Rights as a Stockholder. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, the Participant shall have the rights equivalent to those of a stockholder and shall be a stockholder only after Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) to the Participant. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, a Participant holding Stock Units shall be entitled to receive dividend payments as if he or she were an actual stockholder.

^^Settlement of Stock Awards. Stock Awards shall be settled in a manner consistent with the requirement of Code Section 409A and subject to Section 14(e).

12.***Stock Appreciation Rights.***  
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, a SAR may be granted to a Service Provider at any time and from time to time as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

^^Number of SARs. The Administrator shall have complete discretion to determine the number of SARs granted to any Service Provider.

^^Exercise Price and Other Terms. The per SAR exercise price shall be no less than [[Percentage 2]]% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date.

^^Payment of SAR Amount. Upon exercise of a SAR, the Participant shall be entitled to receive a payment from the Company in an amount equal to the difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the SAR. This amount shall be paid in cash, Shares of equivalent value, or a combination of both, as the Administrator shall determine.

^Cash Awards.   
Each Cash Award will confer upon the Participant the opportunity to earn a future payment tied to the level of achievement with respect to one or more performance criteria established for a performance period.

The maximum amount payable as a Cash Award that is settled for cash may be a multiple of the target amount payable, but the maximum amount payable pursuant to that portion of a Cash Award granted under this Plan for any fiscal year to any Awardee that is intended to satisfy the requirements for “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code shall not exceed $[[USD Value 3: Number]]

^^Performance Criteria. The Administrator shall establish the performance criteria and level of achievement versus these criteria that shall determine the target and the minimum and maximum amount payable under a Cash Award, which criteria may be based on financial performance or personal performance evaluations or both. The Administrator may specify the percentage of the target Cash Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements for “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the performance criteria for any portion of a Cash Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements for “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code shall be a measure established by the Administrator based on one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria selected by the Administrator and specified in writing.

^^Timing and Form of Payment. Subject to Section 14(e), the Administrator shall determine the timing of payment of any Cash Award in a manner consistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A. The Administrator may specify the form of payment of Cash Awards, which may be cash or other property, or may provide for an Awardee to have the option for his or her Cash Award, or such portion thereof as the Administrator may specify, to be paid in whole or in part in cash or other property.

^^Termination of Service. The Administrator shall have the discretion to determine the effect of a Termination of Service on any Cash Award due to (i) disability, (ii) retirement, (iii) death, (iv) participation in a voluntary severance program, or (v) participation in a work force restructuring.

14.***Other Provisions Applicable to Awards.***

^^Non-Transferability of Awards. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by beneficiary designation, will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. The Administrator may make an Award transferable to an Awardee’s family member or any other person or entity. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, either at the time of grant or thereafter, such Award shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate, and any transferee shall be deemed to be bound by such terms upon acc eptance of such transfer.

^^Qualifying Performance Criteria. For purposes of this Plan, the term “Qualifying Performance Criteria” shall mean any one or more of the following performance criteria, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, applied to either the Company as a whole or to a business unit, Affiliate or business segment, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, and measured either annually or cumulatively over a period of years, on an absolute basis or relative to a pre-established target, to previous years’ results or to a designated comparison group, in each case as specified by the Committee in the Award: (i) cash flow, (ii) earnings (including gross margin, earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before taxes, and net earnings), (iii) earnings per share, (iv) growth in earnings or earnings per share, (v) stock price, (vi) return on equity or average stockholders’ equity, (vii) total stockholder return, (viii) return on capital, (ix) return on assets or net assets, (x) return on investment, (xi) revenue, (xii) income or net income, (xiii) operating income or net operating income, (xiv) operating profit or net operating profit, (xv) operating margin, (xvi) return on operating revenue, (xvii) market share, (xviii) contract awards or backlog, (xix) overhead or other expense reduction, (xx) growth in stockholder value relative to the moving average of the S&P 500 Index or a peer group index, (xxi) credit rating, (xxii) strategic plan development and implementation, (xxiii) improvement in workforce diversity, (xxiv) EBITDA, and (xxv) any other similar criteri a.

^^Certification. Prior to the payment of any compensation under an Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall certify the extent to which any Qualifying Performance Criteria and any other material terms under such Award have been satisfied (other than in cases where such relate solely to the increase in the value of the Common Stock).

^^Discretionary Adjustments Pursuant to Section 162(m). Notwithstanding satisfaction or completion of any Qualifying Performance Criteria, to the extent specified at the time of grant of an Award to “covered employees” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the number of Shares, Options or other benefits granted, issued, retained, or vested under an Award on account of satisfaction of such Qualifying Performance Criteria may be reduced by the Committee on the basis of such further considerations as the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine.

^^Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, it is the intent of the Company that all Awards granted under this Plan, including without limitation the administration and settlement of all such Awards, shall comply with the requirement of Code Section 409A and be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intention, in order to avoid the imposition of taxes under Code Section 409A. If, upon a Participant’s separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A, the Participant is then a “specified employee” (as defined in Code Section 409A), the Company shall defer payment of “nonqualified deferred compensation” subject to Code Section 409A payable as a result of and within six (6) months following such separation from service under this Plan and/or applicable Award Agreement until the earlier of (i) ten (10) days after the Company receives notification of the Participant’s death, or (ii) the first business day of the seventh month following the Participant’s separation from service. Any such delayed payments shall be made without interest.

^Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution, Merger or Asset Sale.

^^Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, (i) the number and kind of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the number and kind of shares of Common Stock that have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or that have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Award; (ii) the price per Share subject to each such outstanding Award; and (iii) the Share limitations set forth in Section 3 of the Plan, may be proportionately adjusted if any change is made in the Common Stock subject to the Plan, or subject to any Award, without the receipt of consideration by the Company through a s tock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reincorporation, spin-off, dividend in property other than cash, liquidating dividend, extraordinary dividends or distributions, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been “effected without receipt of consideration.” Such adjustment shall be made by the Administrator in its sole discretion, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Award.

^^Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each Participant as soon as practicable before the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for an Option to be fully vested and exercisable until ten days before such transaction. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any restrictions on any Award shall lapse before the transaction, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately before the consummation of such proposed transaction.  
^^Change in Control. If there is a Change in Control of the Company, as determined by the Board or a Committee, the Board or Committee, or board of directors of any surviving entity or acquiring entity may, in its discretion, (i) provide for the assumption, continuation, or substitution (including an award to acquire substantially the same type of consideration paid to the stockholders in the transaction in which the Change in Control occurs) of, or adjustment to, all or any part of the Awards; (ii) accelerate the vesting of all or any part of the Options and SARs and terminate any restrictions on all or any part of the Stock Awards or Cash Awards; (iii) provide for the cancellation of all or any part of the Awar ds for a cash payment to the Participants; and (iv) provide for the cancellation of all or any part of the Awards as of the closing of the Change in Control; provided, that the Participants are notified that they must exercise or redeem their Awards (including, at the discretion of the Board or Committee, any unvested portion of such Award) at or before the closing of the Change in Control.

^Amendment and Termination of the Plan.

^^Amendment and Termination. The Administrator may amend, alter, or discontinue the Plan or any Award Agreement, but any such amendment shall be subject to approval of the stockholders of the Company in the manner and to the extent required by Applicable Law.

^^Effect of Amendment or Termination. No amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall materially impair the rights of any Award, unless agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator. Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator’s ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan before the date of such termination.

^^Effect of the Plan on Other Arrangements. Neither the adoption of the Plan by the Board or a Committee nor the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or any Committee to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it or they may deem desirable, including the granting of restricted stock or stock options otherwise than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.

^Designation of Beneficiary.  
^^An Awardee may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive the Awardee’s rights pursuant to Awardee’s Award or the Awardee may include his or her Awards in an omnibus beneficiary designation for all benefits under the Plan. To the extent that Awardee has completed a designation of beneficiary such beneficiary designation shall remain in effect with respect to any Award hereunder until changed by the Awardee to the extent enforceable under Applicable Law.

^^Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the Awardee at any time by written notice. If an Awardee dies and no beneficiary is validly designated under the Plan who is living at the time of such Awardee’s death, the Company shall allow the executor or administrator of the estate of the Awardee to exercise the Award, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may allow the spouse or one or more dependents or relatives of the Awardee to exercise the Award to the extent permissible under Applicable Law.

^No Right to Awards or to Service.   
No person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award and the grant of any Award shall not be construed as giving an Awardee the right to continue in the service of the Company or its Affiliates. Further, the Company and its Affiliates expressly reserve the right, at any time, to dismiss any Service Provider or Awardee at any time without liability or any claim under the Plan, except as provided herein or in any Award Agreement entered into hereunder.

^Legal Compliance.   
Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, it is the intent of the Company that the Plan shall be administered so that the additional taxes provided for in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code are not imposed.

^***Inability to Obtain Authority.***   
To the extent the Company is unable to or the Administrator deems that it is not feasible to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company’s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, the Company shall be relieved of any liability with respect to the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

^***Reservation of Shares.***   
The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

^***Notice.***   
Any written notice to the Company required by any provisions of this Plan shall be addressed to the Secretary of the Company and shall be effective when received.

^Governing Law; Interpretation of Plan and Awards.

^^This Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant hereto shall be governed by the substantive laws, but not the choice of law rules, of the state of California.

^^If any provision of the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan is declared to be illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be reformed, if possible, to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid, and enforceable, or otherwise deleted, and the remainder of the terms of the Plan and Award shall not be affected except to the extent necessary to reform or delete such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision.

^^The headings preceding the text of the sections hereof are inserted solely for convenience of reference, and shall not constitute a part of the Plan, nor shall they affect its meaning, construction or effect.

^^The terms of the Plan and any Award shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective permitted heirs, beneficiaries, successors, and assigns.

^^All questions arising under the Plan or under any Award shall be decided by the Administrator in its total and absolute discretion. If the Participant believes that a decision by the Administrator with respect to such person was arbitrary or capricious, the Participant may request arbitration with respect to such decision. The review by the arbitrator shall be limited to determining whether the Administrator’s decision was arbitrary or capricious. This arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive review permitted of the Administrator’s decision, and the Awardee shall as a condition to the receipt of an Award be deemed to explicitly waive any right to judicial review.

^***Limitation on Liability.***   
The Company and any Affiliate or Related Corporation that is in existence or hereafter comes into existence shall not be liable to a Participant, an Employee, an Awardee, or any other persons as to:

^^The Non-Issuance of Shares. The non-issuance or sale of Shares as to which the Company has been unable to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Company’s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder; and

^^Tax Consequences. Any tax consequence expected, but not realized, by any Participant, Employee, Awardee or other person due to the receipt, exercise or settlement of any Option or other Award granted hereunder.

25.***Unfunded Plan.***  
Insofar as it provides for Awards, the Plan shall be unfunded. Although bookkeeping accounts may be established with respect to Awardees who are granted Stock Awards under this Plan, any such accounts will be used merely as a bookkeeping convenience. The Company shall not be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by Awards, nor shall this Plan be construed as providing for such segregation, nor shall the Company or the Administrator be deemed to be a trustee of stock or cash to be awarded under the Plan. Any liability of the Company to any Participant with respect to an Award shall be based solely upon any contractual obligations that may be created by the Plan; no such obligation of the Company shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge or other encumbrance on any property of t he Company. Neither the Company nor the Administrator shall be required to give any security or bond for the performance of any obligation that may be created by this Plan.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company, by its duly authorized officer, has executed this Plan, effective as of [[Date 1]].
