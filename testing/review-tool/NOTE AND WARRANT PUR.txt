Neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement, nor the carrying on of the Company’s business by the employees of the Company, nor the conduct of the Company’s business as presently conducted, will, to the Company’s knowledge, conflict with or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any contract, covenant or instrument under which any such employee is now obligated. The Company does not believe it is or will be necessary to use any inventions of any of its employees made prior to their employment by the Company of which it is aware.

^^^**Confession of Judgment**. The Buyer agrees it will not file a Confession of Judgment unless and until an Event of Default or a Liquidity Default (as defined in the Notes) under a Note has occurred; provided, however, that upon such an Event of Default, the Buyer shall be entitled to immediately file such Confession in an ex parte fashion.

^^**Covenants, Acknowledgements and Agreements of the Company.** As a condition to the Buyer’s obligation to purchase the Securities contemplated by this Agreement, and as a material inducement for the Buyer to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, until all of the Company’s obligations hereunder and all of the Notes are paid and performed in full, or within the timeframes otherwise specifically set forth below, the Company shall comply with the following covenants:

^^^**Filings**. From the date hereof until all the Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares either have been sold by the Buyer, or may permanently be sold by the Buyer without any restrictions pursuant to Rule 144, (the “Registration Period”), the Company shall timely make all filings required to be made by it under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, Rule 144 or any United States state securities laws and regulations thereof applicable to the Company or by the rules and regulations of the Principal Trading Market, and such reports shall conform to the requirement of the applicable laws, regulations and government agencies, and, unless such filing is publicly available on the SEC’s EDGAR system (via the SEC’s web site at no additional charge), the Company shall provide, upon written request, a copy thereof to the Buyer promptly after such filing. The Company shall furnish to the Buyer, upon written request, so long as the Buyer owns any Purchased Securities or Common Stock, promptly upon request, (1) a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, (2) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company, and (3) such other information as may be reasonably requested to permit the Buyer to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without registration.

^^^**Reporting Status**. So long as the Buyer beneficially owns any of the Purchased Securities and for at least twenty (20) Trading Days thereafter, the Company shall file all reports required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act, shall take all reasonable action under its control to ensure that adequate current public information with respect to the Company, as required in accordance with Rule 144(c)(2) of the 1933 Act, is publicly available, and shall not terminate its status as an issuer required to file reports under the 1934 Act even if the 1934 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would permit such termination.

^^^**Listing**. The Company’s Common Stock shall be listed or quoted for trading on any of (a) the American Stock Exchange, (b) New York Stock Exchange, (c) the Nasdaq Global Market, (d) the Nasdaq Capital Market, or (e) the Nasdaq OTC Bulletin Board. The Company shall promptly secure the listing of all of the Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares upon each national securities exchange and automated quotation system, if any, upon which the Common Stock is then listed (subject to official notice of issuance) and shall maintain such listing of all securities from time to time issuable under the terms of the Transaction Documents. The Company will comply in all material respects with the Company’s reporting, filing and other obligations under the by-laws or rules of the Principal Trading Market and/or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) or any successor thereto, as the case may be, applicable to it at least through the date which is sixty (60) days after the later of the date on which (1) all of the Notes have been converted, (2) all of the Notes have been paid in full, or (3) all of the Warrants have been fully exercised.

^^^**Use of Proceeds**. The Company will use the net proceeds received hereunder (a) to prepay in the amount of $[[USD Value 9: Number]] that certain Convertible Promissory Note dated [[Date 3: Date]] executed by the Company in favor of the Buyer (the “Prepayment Amount”), and (b) the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company agrees that the Prepayment Amount shall be withheld by the Buyer at the Initial Closing and that the Initial Net Purchase Price payable at the Initial Closing shall be reduced accordingly.

^^^**Publicity, Filings, Releases, Etc**. Each of the parties agrees that it will not disseminate any information relating to the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, including issuing any press releases, holding any press conferences or other forums, or filing any reports (collectively, “Publicity”), without giving the other party reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to comment on the contents thereof. Neither party will include in any such Publicity any statement or statements or other material to which the other party reasonably objects, unless in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the party proposing such statement, such statement is legally required to be included. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company will provide to the Buyer’s Counsel drafts of the applicable text of the first filing of a current report on Form 8-K or a Quarterly or Annual Report on Form 10-Q or 10-K (or equivalent SB forms), as the case may be, intended to be made with the SEC which refers to the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby as soon as practicable (but at least two (2) Trading Days before such filing will be made) and will not include in such filing (or any other filing filed before then) any statement or statements or other material to which the other party reasonably objects, unless in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the party proposing such statement, such statement is legally required to be included. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereby consents to the inclusion of the text of the Transaction Documents in filings made with the SEC (but any descriptive text accompanying or part of such filing shall be subject to the other provisions of this subsection). Notwithstanding, but subject to, the foregoing provisions of this provision, the Company will, within four business days after the Initial Closing Date, promptly issue a press release and file a current report on Form 8-K or, if appropriate, a quarterly or annual report on the appropriate form, describing the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents in the form required by the 1934 Act and approved by Buyer and attaching the material Transaction Documents as exhibits to such filing.

^^^**FINRA Rule 5110**. In the event the Corporate Financing Rule 5110 (“FINRA Rule 5110”) of FINRA is or becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or to the sale by a Holder of any of the Securities, then the Company shall, to the extent required by such rule, timely make any filings and cooperate with any broker or selling stockholder in respect of any consents, authorizations or approvals that may be necessary for FINRA to timely and expeditiously permit the Holder to sell the Securities.

^^^**Keeping of Records and Books of Account**. The Company shall keep and cause each Subsidiary, if any, to keep adequate records and books of account, in which complete entries will be made in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, reflecting all financial transactions of the Company and such Subsidiaries, and in which, for each fiscal year, all proper reserves for depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, amortization, taxes, bad debts and other purposes in connection with its business shall be made.

^^^**Corporate Existence**. The Company shall (a) do all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence, including, without limitation, all licenses or similar qualifications required by it to engage in its business in all jurisdictions in which it is as of the date hereof so engaged, (b) continue to engage in business of the same general type as conducted as of the date hereof, and (c) continue to conduct its business substantially as now conducted or as otherwise permitted hereunder.

^^^**Taxes**. The Company shall pay and discharge promptly when due all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its income or profits or in respect of its property before the same shall become delinquent or in default, which, if unpaid, might reasonably be expected to give rise to liens or charges upon such properties or any part thereof, unless, in each case, the validity or amount thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and the Company has maintained adequate reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP.

^^^**Compliance**. The Company shall comply in all material respects with all federal, state and local laws and regulations, orders, judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules, regulations, permits, licenses, authorizations and requirements applicable to it (collectively, “Requirements”) of all governmental bodies, departments, commissions, boards, companies or associations insuring the premises, courts, authorities, officials or officers which are applicable to the Company, its business, operations, or any of its properties, except where the failure to so comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or any of its properties; provided, however, that nothing provided herein shall prevent the Company from contesting in good faith the validity or the application of any Requirements.

^^^**Litigation**. From and after the date hereof and until all of the Company’s obligations hereunder and all of the Notes are paid and performed in full, the Company shall notify the Buyer in writing, promptly upon learning thereof, of any litigation or administrative proceeding commenced or threatened against the Company involving a claim in excess of $[[USD Value 10: Number]]

^^^**Performance of Obligations**. The Company shall promptly and in a timely fashion perform and honor all demands, notices, requests and obligations that exist or may arise under the Transaction Documents.

^^^**Authorized Shares**. The Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to at all times have authorized, and reserved for the purpose of issuance, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall be necessary to effect the full conversion of all of the Notes and exercise of all of the Warrants (the “***Share Reserve***”). If at any time the Share Reserve is insufficient to effect the full conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants, the Company shall immediately increase the Share Reserve accordingly. If the Company does not have sufficient authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock available to increase the Share Reserve, the Company shall call and hold a special meeting of the shareholders within thirty days of such occurrence, for the sole purpose of increasing the number of shares authorized. The Company’s management shall recommend to the Company’s shareholders to vote in favor of increasing the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. Management shall also vote all of its shares in favor of increasing the number of authorized shares of Common Stock.

^^^**Investor Information**. Upon written request, the Company shall promptly furnish the Buyer with the names and other identifying information of each party with which the Company has completed a financing transaction including, without limitation, any person or entity to whom the Company has issued or sold any debt, equity, option, warrant or other security of any kind during the five year period immediately preceding the request.

^^^**Certain Negative Covenants of the Company**. From and after the date hereof and until all of the Company’s obligations hereunder and all of the Notes are paid and performed in full, the Company shall not:

^Incur any new indebtedness for borrowed money without the prior written consent of the Buyer; provided, however, the Company may incur obligations under trade payables in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice without the consent of the Buyer; or

^Grant or permit any security interest (or other lien or other encumbrance) in or on any of its assets except as incurred in the ordinary course of business; or

^Enter into any transaction, including, without limitation, any purchase, sale, lease or exchange of property or the rendering of any service, with any Affiliate of the Company, or amend or modify any agreement related to any of the foregoing, except on terms that are no less favorable, in any material respect, than those obtainable from any person or entity who is not an Affiliate of the Company; or

^Enter into any financing transaction without giving the Buyer at least ten (10) days notice of such prospective financing transaction (the “Transaction Notice”) and the pre-emptive right to provide such financing on substantially the same terms upon notice thereof to the Company within five (5) days of receiving the Transaction Notice.

^TRANSFER AGENT INSTRUCTIONS.  

^^The Company warrants that, with respect to the Securities, other than the stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 6(a)(i) hereof, it will give the Transfer Agent no instructions inconsistent with instructions to issue Common Stock from time to time upon conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants, as may be applicable from time to time, in such amounts as specified from time to time by the Company to the Transfer Agent, bearing the restrictive legend specified in Section 6(a)(ii) of this Agreement prior to registration of the Shares under the 1933 Act, registered in the name of the Buyer or its nominee and in such denominations to be specified by the Holder in connection therewith. Except as so provided, the Shares shall otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of the Company as and to the extent provided in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Nothing in this Section shall affect in any way the Buyer’s obligations and agreement to comply with all applicable securities laws upon resale of the Securities. If the Buyer provides the Company with an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company that registration of a resale by the Buyer of any of the Securities in accordance with clause (1)(B) of Section 6(a)(i) of this Agreement is not required under the 1933 Act or upon request from a Holder while an applicable Registration Statement is effective, the Company shall (except as provided in clause (2) of Section 6(a)(i) of this Agreement) permit the transfer of the Securities and, in the case of the Conversion Shares, as may be applicable, use its best efforts to cause the Transfer Agent to promptly electronically transmit to the Holder via the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) Fast Automated Securities Transfer program such Conversion Shares. The Company specifically represents that, as of the date hereof and as of the Initial Closing Date and the date of each Subsequent Closing, (i) the Company’s Transfer Agent is (a) participating in the DTC program, (b) is DWAC eligible, and (ii) the Company is not aware of any plans of the Transfer Agent to terminate such DTC participation or DWAC eligibility. While any Holder holds Securities, the Company shall at all times maintain a transfer agent which participates in the DTC program and is DWAC eligible, and the Company will not appoint any transfer agent which does not both participate in the DTC program and maintain DWAC eligibility. Nevertheless, in the event the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC/DWAC program or the Conversion Shares are not otherwise transferable via the DTC/DWAC program, then the Company shall instruct the Transfer Agent to issue one or more certificates for Common Stock without legend in such name and in such denominations as specified by the Buyer. In the event the Company’s transfer agent is not DWAC eligible on any Conversion Date, and consequently the Company issues Conversion Shares pursuant to the Notice of Conversion in certificated rather than electronic form, then in such event if the closing bid price of the Common Stock on the Principal Trading Market is lower on the date of delivery of the certificates to the Buyer than on the Conversion Date, such difference in the closing bid prices, multiplied by the number of Conversion Shares, shall be added to the principal balance of the applicable Note.

^^^^^The Company understands that a delay in the delivery of Shares, whether on conversion of a Note and/or in payment of accrued interest, or exercise of a Warrant, beyond the relevant Delivery Date (as defined in the applicable Note or Warrant, as applicable) could result in economic loss to the Holder. As compensation to the Holder for such loss, in addition to any other available remedies at law or equity, the Company agrees to pay late payments to the Holder for late delivery of the Shares in accordance with the following schedule (where “No. Business Days Late” is defined as the number of Trading Days beyond two (2) Trading Days after the Delivery Date):

Late Payment for Each $[[USD Value 11: Number]] of Principal or Interest Being Converted or **No. Business Days Late**      **Amount of Warrant Exercise (Cash or Cashless)** 

$[[USD Value 16: Number]]         $[[USD Value 17: Number]]         $[[USD Value 18: Number]]         $[[USD Value 19: Number]]         $[[USD Value 20: Number]]         $[[USD Value 21: Number]]         $[[USD Value 22: Number]]         $[[USD Value 23: Number]]         $[[USD Value 24: Number]]         $[[USD Value 12: Number]] >10         $[[USD Value 12]] + $[[USD Value 17]] for each Business Day Late beyond 10 days  

The amount of any payments incurred under this Section 7(b) shall be automatically added to the principal balance of the applicable Note and the Company shall pay any such payments in immediately available funds upon demand. Nothing herein shall limit the Holder’s right to pursue actual damages for the Company’s failure to issue and deliver the Shares to the Holder within a reasonable time. Furthermore, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to a Holder, in the event that the Company fails for any reason to effect delivery of such Shares within two (2) Trading Days after the Delivery Date, the Holder will be entitled to revoke the relevant Notice of Conversion or Notice of Exercise (under the applicable Warrant) by delivering a notice to such effect to the Company prior to the Holder’s receipt of the relevant Shares, whereupon the Company and the Holder shall each be restored to their respective positions immediately prior to delivery of such Notice of Conversion or Notice of Exercise, as the case may be; **provided**, **however**, that any payments contemplated by this Section 7(b) which have accrued through the date of such revocation notice shall remain due and owing to the Holder notwithstanding such revocation.

^^^If, by the tenth Trading Day after the relevant Delivery Date, the Company fails for any reason to deliver the Shares, but at any time after the Delivery Date, the Holder purchases, in an arm’s-length open market transaction or otherwise, shares of Common Stock (the “Covering Shares”) in order to make delivery in satisfaction of a sale of Common Stock by the Holder (the “Sold Shares”), which delivery such Holder anticipated to make using the shares to be issued upon such conversion or exercise (a “Buy-In”), the Holder shall have the right to require the Company to pay to the Holder, in addition to and not in lieu of the amounts contemplated in other provisions of the Transaction Documents, including, but not limited to, the provisions of the immediately preceding Section 7(b)(i)), the Buy-In Adjustment Amount (as defined hereafter). The “Buy-In Adjustment Amount” is the amount equal to the number of Sold Shares multiplied by the excess, if any, of (1) the Holder’s total purchase price per share (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the Covering Shares over (2) the net proceeds per share (after brokerage commissions, if any) received by the Holder from the sale of the Sold Shares. The Company shall pay the Buy-In Adjustment Amount to the Holder in immediately available funds immediately upon demand by the Holder. By way of illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing, if the Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price (including brokerage commissions) of $[[USD Value 13: Number]] to cover a Buy-In with respect to shares of Common Stock it sold for net proceeds of $[[USD Value 14: Number]] the Buy-In Adjustment Amount which Company will be required to pay to the Holder will be $[[USD Value 15: Number]]

^^The Company shall assume any fees or charges of the Transfer Agent or Company Counsel regarding (i) the removal of a legend or stop transfer instructions with respect to the Securities, and (ii) the issuance of certificates or DTC registration to or in the name of the Holder or the Holder’s designee or to a transferee as contemplated by an effective Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall be the Holder’s responsibility to obtain all needed formal requirements (specifically: medallion guarantee and prospectus delivery compliance) in connection with any electronic issuance of shares of Common Stock.

^^The Holder of a Note shall be entitled to exercise its conversion privilege with respect to such Note, as the case may be, notwithstanding the commencement of any case under 11 U.S.C. §101 **et** **seq.** (the “Bankruptcy Code”). In the event the Company is a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code, the Company hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted, any rights to relief it may have under 11 U.S.C. §362 in respect of such Holder’s exercise privilege. The Company hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted, any rights to relief it may have under 11 U.S.C. §362 in respect of the conversion of such Note. The Company agrees, without cost or expense to such Holder, to take or to consent to any and all action necessary to effectuate relief under 11 U.S.C. §362.

^CLOSING DATES.  

^^The Initial Closing Date shall occur on the date which is the first Trading Day after each of the conditions contemplated by Sections 9 and 10 hereof shall have either been satisfied or been waived by the party in whose favor such conditions run, but in any event shall not be later than [[Date 1]]. Closing of the purchase and sale of the First Note and First Warrant, which the parties anticipate shall occur concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, shall occur at the offices of the Buyer and shall take place no later than 3:00 P.M., Eastern Time, or on such day or such other time as is mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Buyer.

^**CONDITIONS TO THE COMPANY’S OBLIGATION TO SELL AT THE INITIAL CLOSING.** The Buyer understands that the Company’s obligation to sell the First Note and First Warrant to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement on the Initial Closing Date is conditioned upon and subject to the fulfillment of all of the following conditions, any of which may be waived in whole or in part by the Company:

^^The Company agrees to defend, indemnify and forever hold harmless the Buyer and its officers, directors, employees, and agents, and each Buyer Control Person (the “Buyer Parties”) from and against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses incurred (collectively, “Damages”), joint or several, and any action in respect thereof to which the Buyer, its partners, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and duly authorized agents, and any such Buyer Control Person becomes subject, resulting from, arising out of or relating to any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Company contained in this Agreement, as such Damages are incurred. The Buyer Parties with the right to be indemnified under this Section (the “Indemnified Parties”) shall have the right to defend any such action or proceeding with attorneys of their own selection, and the Company shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses related thereto. If the Indemnified Parties opt not to retain their own counsel, the Company shall defend any such action or proceeding with attorneys of its choosing at its sole cost and expense, provided that such attorneys have been pre-approved by the Indemnified Parties, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and provided further that the Company may not settle any such action or proceeding without first obtaining the written consent of the Indemnified Parties.

^^The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (i) any cause of action or similar rights of the Buyer Parties against the Company or others, and (ii) any liabilities the Company may be subject to.

^**SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.** The Company and the Buyer acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties (including any Holder) shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without (except as specified below) the necessity to post a bond, to prevent or cure breaches of the provisions of this Agreement or such other Transaction Document and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof or thereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which any of them may be entitled by law or equity; provided, however that the Company, upon receipt of a Notice of Conversion or a Notice of Exercise, may not fail or refuse to deliver the stock certificates and the related legal opinions, if any, or if there is a claim for a breach by the Company of any other provision of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, the Company shall not raise as a legal defense any claim that the Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with the Holder has violated any provision hereof or any other Transaction Document or has engaged in any violation of law or any other claim or defense, unless the Company has first posted a bond for one hundred fifty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the principal amount and, if relevant, then obtained a court order specifically directing it not to deliver said stock certificates to the Holder. The proceeds of such bond shall be payable to the Holder to the extent that the Holder obtains judgment or its defense is recognized. Such bond shall remain in effect until the completion of the relevant proceeding and, if the Holder appeals therefrom, until all such appeals are exhausted. This provision is deemed incorporated by reference into each of the Transaction Documents as if set forth therein in full.

^**OWNERSHIP LIMITATION.** If at any time after the Initial Closing the Buyer shall or would receive shares of the Common Stock in payment of interest or principal under a Note or upon conversion of such Note or exercise of a Warrant so that the Buyer would hold by virtue of such action or receipt of shares of Common Stock a number of shares exceeding [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock outstanding on such date (the “[[Percentage 2]]% Cap”), the Company shall not be obligated and shall not issue to the Buyer shares of its Common Stock which would exceed the [[Percentage 2]]% Cap, but only until such time as the [[Percentage 2]]% Cap would no longer be exceeded by any such receipt of shares of Common Stock by the Buyer.

^**GOVERNING LAW; MISCELLANEOUS.** The Company and the Buyer hereby agree that the provisions of this Section 17 shall apply to all of the Transaction Documents.

^^**Governing Law and Venue**. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois for contracts to be wholly performed in such state and without giving effect to the principles thereof regarding the conflict of laws. Each of the parties consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts whose districts encompass any part of the County of Cook or the state courts of the State of Illinois sitting in the County of Cook in connection with any dispute arising under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents and hereby waives, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any objection, including any objection based on forum non conveniens, to the bringing of any such proceeding in such jurisdictions or any claim that such venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper. Nothing in this subsection shall affect or limit any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

^^**No Waiver**. Failure of any party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement or otherwise, or delay by a party in exercising such right or remedy, shall not operate as a waiver thereof.
