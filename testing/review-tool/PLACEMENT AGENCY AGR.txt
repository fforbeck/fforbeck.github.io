The shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are hereinafter referred to as the "Warrant Shares" and the Shares, the Warrants and the Warrant Shares are hereinafter referred to as the "Securities." The Securities are more fully described in the Prospectus (as defined below). The Company desires to engage Roth Capital Partners in connection with such issuance and sale of the Securities.

The Company hereby confirms its agreement with you as follows:

^**Agreement to Act as Placement Agent**.

^^On the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained, and subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement between the Company and you, Roth Capital Partners shall be the Company’s exclusive placement agent (in such capacity, the “Placement Agent”), on a reasonable efforts basis, in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of the Securities to the Investors in a proposed takedown under the Registration Statement (as defined below), with the terms of each offering to be subject to market conditions and negotiations between the Company, the Placement Agent and the prospective Investors (such takedown shall be referred to herein as the “Offering”). As compensation for services rendered, and provided that any of the Securities are sold to Investors in the Offering, on the Closing Date (as defined below) of the Offering, the Company shall pay to the Placement Agent an amount equal to [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Securities (the “Placement Fee”). The sale of the Securities shall be made pursuant to securities purchase agreements in the form included as **Exhibit A** hereto (the “Subscription Agreements”) on the terms described on **Exhibit B** hereto. The Company shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase the Securities and may reject any such offer in whole or in part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Placement Agent or any of their respective affiliates may, solely at their discretion and without any obligation to do so, purchase Securities as principal; provided, however, that any such purchases by the Placement Agent (or their respective affiliates) shall be fully disclosed to the Company and approved by the Company in accordance with the previous sentence.

^^This Agreement shall not give rise to any commitment by the Placement Agent to purchase any of the Securities, and the Placement Agent shall have no authority to bind the Company. The Placement Agent shall act on a reasonable efforts basis and does not guarantee that it will be able to raise new capital in the Offering. The Placement Agent may retain other brokers or dealers to act as sub-agents on its behalf in connection with the Offering, the fees of which shall be paid out of the Placement Fee. Prior to the earlier of (i) the date on which this Agreement is terminated and (ii) the Closing Date (as defined below), the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Placement Agent, solicit or accept offers to purchase Securities of the Company (other than pursuant to the grant of options or restricted stock awards under the Company's equity compensation plans or the exercise of options or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock that are outstanding at the date hereof) otherwise than through the Placement Agent in accordance herewith.

^^The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Placement Agent shall act as an independent contractor, and not as a fiduciary, and any duties of the Placement Agent with respect to investment banking services to the Company, including the offering of the Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the Offering), shall be contractual in nature, as expressly set forth herein, and shall be owed solely to the Company. Each party disclaims any intention to impose any fiduciary or similar duty on the other. Additionally, the Placement Agent has not advised, nor is advising, the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Placement Agent shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Placement Agent of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions has been and will be performed solely for the benefit of the Placement Agent and has not been and shall not be on behalf of the Company or any other person. It is understood that the Placement Agent has not and will not be rendering an opinion to the Company as to the fairness of the terms of the Offering. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company acknowledges that the Placement Agent may have financial interests in the success of the Offering contemplated hereby that are not limited to the Placement Fee. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Placement Agent with respect to any breach or alleged breach of fiduciary duty.

^^Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Securities shall be made at a closing (the “Closing”) at the offices of Lowenstein Sandler P.C., counsel for the Placement Agent, located at [[Address 2: Address]] at 10:00 a.m., local time, as soon as practicable after the determination of the public offering price of the Securities, but not later than on [[Date 2: Date]] (such date of payment and delivery being herein called the “Closing Date”). All such actions taken at the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred simultaneously. No Securities which the Company has agreed to sell pursuant to this Agreement and the Subscription Agreements shall be deemed to have been purchased and paid for, or sold by the Company, until such Securities shall have been delivered to the Investor thereof against payment therefore by such Investor. If the Company shall default in its obligations to deliver Securities to an Investor whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Placement Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage incurred by the Placement Agent arising from or as a result of such default by the Company.

^^On the Closing Date, (i) the Investors will wire the purchase price for their respective Securities to the Company pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreements and the Company will wire the amounts owed to the Placement Agent as provided in this Agreement and (ii) the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered the Securities to the Investors, with the delivery of the Shares to be made, if possible, through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company's DWAC system, and the delivery of the Warrants to be made by mail to the Investors to the addresses set forth on the applicable Subscription Agreement.

^^The Securities shall be registered in such names and in such denominations as the Placement Agent shall request by written notice to the Company.

^**Indemnification and Contribution**.

^^Indemnification of the Placement Agent. The Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Placement Agent, its respective directors and officers, and each person, if any, who controls such Placement Agent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, claim or liability, which, jointly or severally, such Placement Agent or any such person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, the common law or otherwise, (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company), insofar as such loss, damage, claim or liability (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and, in the case of (i) and (ii) above, to reimburse such Placement Agent and each such controlling person for any and all reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) as such expenses are incurred by such Placement Agent or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, it arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in or omitted from, and in conformity with information concerning such Placement Agent furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Placement Agent to the Company expressly for use therein, which information the parties hereto agree is limited to the Placement Agent Information (as defined in Section 7), (iii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement made by the Company in Section 3 hereof or the failure by the Company to perform when and as required any agreement or covenant contained herein or (iv) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any audio or visual materials provided to Investors by or with the approval of the Company or based upon written information furnished by or on behalf of the Company with its approval including, without limitation, slides, videos, films or tape recordings used in any road show or investor presentations made to investors by the Company (whether in person or electronically) or in connection with the marketing of the Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be liable to the Placement Agent pursuant to this **Section 6(a)** to the extent that any such loss, damage, claim or liability is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the Placement Agent’ willful misconduct or gross negligence.

^^Indemnification of the Company. The Placement Agent will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers, and any person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred to which, jointly or severally, the Company or any such person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, the common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of such Placement Agent), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, to the extent but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with information concerning such Placement Agent furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Placement Agent to the Company expressly for use therein and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, that the parties hereto hereby agree that such written information provided by the Placement Agent consists solely of the Placement Agent Information. Notwithstanding the provisions of this **Section 6(b)**, in no event shall any indemnity by any Placement Agent under this **Section 6(b)** exceed its pro rata share of the Placement Fee.

^^Notice and Procedures. If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a “Proceeding”) is brought against a person (an “indemnified party”) in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company or any Placement Agent (as applicable, the “indemnifying party”) pursuant to **subsection (a)** or (b), respectively, of this Section 6, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; provided, however, that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party or otherwise, except to the extent the indemnifying party does not otherwise learn of the Proceeding and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights or defenses. The indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or (iii) such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party, in any of which events such reasonable fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding (including by consent to the entry of any judgment) effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel (which fees and expenses shall be reasonably documented) as contemplated by the second sentence of this **Section 6(c)**, then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 90 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days’ prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.

^^Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to an indemnified party under **subsections (a)** or (b) of this Section 6 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in s**ubsection (a)** or (b) above, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agent on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agent on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Placement Fee received by the Placement Agent, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agent on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Placement Agent, on the other hand, and the parties’ relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Placement Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this **subsection (d)** were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this **Section 6(d)**. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this **Section 6(d)** shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this **Section 6(d)**. Notwithstanding the provisions of this **Section 6(d)**, no Placement Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the Placement Fee. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

^^Representations and Agreements to Survive Delivery. The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. The indemnity and contribution agreements of the parties contained in this Section 6 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Placement Agent, any person who controls any Placement Agent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or any affiliate of any Placement Agent, or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and (iii) the issuance and delivery of the Securities. The Company and each of the Placement Agent agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company’s officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities, or in connection with the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus.

^**Information Furnished by Placement Agent**.

The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the third paragraph under the heading “Plan of Distribution” in the Prospectus (the “Placement Agent Information”) constitute the only information relating to the Placement Agent furnished in writing to the Company by the Placement Agent as such information is referred to in **Sections 2** and 6 hereof.

^**Termination**.  

^^The Placement Agent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving notice as hereinafter specified at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, without liability on the part of the Placement Agent to the Company, if (i) prior to delivery and payment for the Securities (A) trading in securities generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Stock Market, the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the NASDAQ Global Market, the NASDAQ Capital Market or the NYSE Amex (each, a “Trading Market”), (B) trading in the shares of Common Stock of the Company shall have been suspended or materially limited on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market, (C) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York state authorities, (D) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or there shall have been a declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, (E) there shall have occurred any other calamity or crisis or any material change in general economic, political or financial conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (D) or (E), in the judgment of the Placement Agent, makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the completion of the sale of and payment for the Securities on the Closing Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, or (ii) since the time of execution of this Agreement or the earlier respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package, there has been (A) any Material Adverse Effect or (B) the Company shall have sustained a loss by strike, fire, flood, earthquake, accident or other calamity of such character that in the judgment of the Placement Agent would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect and which would, in the judgment of the Placement Agent, make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 4, Section 6, **Section 8(b)** and Section 11 hereof shall at all times be effective notwithstanding such termination.

^^If (1) this Agreement shall be terminated by the Placement Agent pursuant to Section 5, **Section 8(a)(i)(B)** or **Section 8(a)(ii)(A)** or (2) the sale of the Securities to Investors is not consummated because of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or perform any agreement or obligation of this Agreement or any Subscription Agreement, other than by reason of a default by the Placement Agent, the Company will, in addition to paying the amounts described in Section 4 hereof, reimburse the Placement Agent for all of their reasonable and actual out-of-pocket disbursements (including, but not limited to, the reasonable fees and disbursements of its counsel).

The Company further acknowledges that the Placement Agent is acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arm’s length basis and in no event do the parties intend that the Placement Agent act or be responsible as a fiduciary to the Company, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that the Placement Agent may undertake or have undertaken in furtherance of the offering of the Company’s securities, either before or after the date hereof. The Placement Agent hereby expressly disclaims any fiduciary or similar obligations to the Company, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions, and the Company hereby confirms its understanding and agreement to that effect. The Company and the Placement Agent agree that they are each responsible for making their own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions, and that any opinions or views expressed by the Placement Agent to the Company regarding such transactions, including but not limited to any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Company’s securities, do not constitute advice or recommendations to the Company.

The Company hereby consents to personal jurisdiction, service and venue in any court in which any Proceeding arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement is brought by any third party against the Placement Agent.
