^SUBORDINATION. 

^^Subordination. The Bank Mortgage and any and all extensions, renewals, modifications or replacements thereof shall be and at all times remain a lien or charge on the Property prior and superior to the Subordinated Mortgage. Mortgagee intentionally and unconditionally waives, relinquishes and subordinates the priority and superiority of the lien or charge of the Subordinated Mortgage to the lien or charge on the Property of the Bank Mortgage (including liens and charges thereunder securing all future advances of the Bank Loan and other advances contemplated thereunder). 

^^Reliance. Mortgagee acknowledges that Bank, in continuing to extend credit secured by the Property, including the Bank Loan, is doing so in material reliance on this Agreement. 

^^Acknowledgments of Mortgagee. Mortgagee acknowledges that it has such information with respect to the Bank Loan, and any promissory note and other loan documents executed in connection therewith, as Mortgagee deems necessary in order to grant this subordination. 

^^Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the whole and only agreement between the parties hereto with regard to the subordination of the Subordinated Mortgage to the lien or charge of the Bank Mortgage; there are no agreements (written or oral) outside or separate from this Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof; and all prior negotiations with respect thereto, if any, are merged into this Agreement. This Agreement shall supersede and cancel, but only insofar as would affect the priority between the Subordinated Mortgage and the Bank Mortgage, any prior agreements as to such subordination, including without limitation those provisions, if any, contained in the Subordinated Mortgage which provide for the subordination thereof to the lien of a deed of trust or mortgage affecting all or any portion of the Property. 

^MISCELLANEOUS. 

^^Notices. All notices, requests and demands which any party is required or may desire to give to any other party under any provision of this Agreement must be in writing delivered to each party at the address set forth below its signature, or to such other address as any party may designate by written notice to all other parties. Each such notice, request and demand shall be deemed given or made as follows: (i) if sent by hand delivery, upon delivery; (ii) if sent by mail, upon the earlier of the date of receipt or three (3) days after deposit in the U.S. mail, first class and postage prepaid; and (iii) if sent by telecopy, upon receipt. 

^^Costs, Expenses and Attorneys’ Fees. If any party hereto institutes any arbitration or judicial or administrative action or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Agreement, or alleging any breach of any provision hereof or seeking damages or any remedy, the losing party or parties shall pay to the prevailing party or parties all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees (to include outside counsel fees and all allocated costs of such prevailing party’s in-house counsel), expended or incurred by the prevailing party or parties in connection therewith, whether incurred at the trial or appellate level, in an arbitration proceeding or otherwise, and including any of the foregoing incurred in connection with any bankruptcy proceeding (including without limitation, any adversary proceeding, contested matter or motion brought by Bank or any other person) relating to Owner, Mortgagee or any other person or entity. 

^^Further Assurances. At the request of any party hereto, each other party shall execute, acknowledge and deliver such other documents and/or instruments as may be reasonably required by the requesting party in order to carry out the purpose of this Agreement, provided that no such document or instrument shall modify the rights and obligations of the parties set forth herein. 

^^Successors; Assigns; Amendment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties. This Agreement may be amended or modified only in writing signed by all parties hereto. 

^^Severability of Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such waiver or other provision or any remaining provisions of this Agreement. 

^^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute and be construed as one and the same instrument. 

^^Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota.
