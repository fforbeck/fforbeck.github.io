The reference proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 638 through 645.1, inclusive. The private judge shall have the power, among others, to grant provisional relief, including without limitation, entering temporary restraining orders, issuing preliminary and permanent injunctions and appointing receivers. All such proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed. If during the course of any dispute, a party desires to seek provisional relief, but a judge has not been appointed at that point pursuant to the judicial reference procedures, then such party may apply to the Santa Clara County, California Superior Court for such relief. The proceeding before the private judge shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The parties shall be entitled to discovery which shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of discovery applicable to judicial proceedings. The private judge shall oversee discovery and may enforce all discovery rules and order applicable to judicial proceedings in the same manner as a trial court judge. The parties agree that the selected or appointed private judge shall have the power to decide all issues in the action or proceeding, whether of fact or of law, and shall report a statement of decision thereon pursuant to the California Code of Civil Procedure § 644(a). Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of any party at any time to exercise self-help remedies, foreclose against collateral, or obtain provisional remedies. The private judge shall also determine all issues relating to the applicability, interpretation, and enforceability of this paragraph.**","**[**","**[[Bank]]**","**[[Borrower]]**","**]**","**but**","**however**","**if**","**minus**","**plus**","**provided**","**“Cash Equivalents”**","**“Cash Management Services”**","**“Final Payment”**","**“Foreign Currency”**","**“Material Adverse Change”**","**“Maximum Dollar Amount”**","**“Operating Documents”**","**“Revolving Line Maturity Date”**","**“Term Loan Advance”**","**“Term Loan Amount”**","**“Term Loan Draw Period”**","**“Term Loan Termination Fee”**","**“Term Loan”**","“**$**”","“**Account Debtor**”","“**Account**”","“**Advance**”","“**Advances**”","“**Affiliate**”","“**Agreement**”","“**Availability Amount**”","“**Bank Expenses**”","“**Bank**”","“**Borrower**”","“**Borrower’s Books**”","“**Borrowing Base**”","“**Borrowing Resolutions**”","“**Business Day**”","“**Cash Management Services**”","“**Code**”","“**Collateral Account**”","“**Collateral**”","“**Commodity Account**”","“**Communication**”","“**Compliance Certificate**”","“**Contingent Obligation**”","“**Control Agreement**”","“**Credit Extension**”","“**Default Rate**”","“**Default**”","“**Deferred Revenue**”","“**Deposit Account**”","“**Designated Deposit Account**”","“**Dollars**","“**ERISA**”","“**Effective Date**”","“**Eligible Accounts**”","“**Eligible Foreign Accounts**”","“**Equipment**”","“**Event of Default**”","“**FX Business Day**”","“**FX Forward Contract**”","“**FX Reserve**”","“**Funding Date**”","“**GAAP**”","“**General Intangibles**”","“**Governmental Approval**”","“**Governmental Authority**”","“**Guarantor**”","“**IP Agreement**”","“**Indebtedness**”","“**Insolvency Proceeding**”","“**Inventory**”","“**Investment**”","“**Letter of Credit Application**”","“**Letter of Credit Reserve**”","“**Letter of Credit”**","“**Lien**”","“**Loan Documents**”","“**Minimum Cash Requirement**”","“**Obligations**”","“**Overadvance**”","“**Perfection Certificate**”","“**Permitted Indebtedness**”","“**Permitted Investments**”","“**Permitted Liens**”","“**Person**”","“**Prime Rate**”","“**Registered Organization**”","“**Requirement of Law**”","“**Reserves**”","“**Responsible Officer**”","“**Revolving Line**”","“**Securities Account**”","“**Settlement Date**”","“**Streamline Period**”","“**Subordinated Debt**”","“**Subsidiary**”","“**Tangible Net Worth**”","“**Term Loan Maturity Date**”","“**Term Loan Payment**”","“**Total Liabilities**”","“**Transaction Report**”","“**Transfer**”","“**Warrant**”","“**dollars**”","“Agreement”","“Borrower”","“Financed Site”","“Minimum Tangible Net Worth”","“Overall Sublimit”","“Term Loan Payment”"]}}
