The initial Calculation Agent shall be Wells Fargo Securities. Pursuant to the Calculation Agency Agreement, the Company may appoint a different Calculation Agent from time to time after the initial issuance of the Securities of this series without the consent of the Holders of the Securities of this series and without notifying the Holders of the Securities of this series. 

The “Closing Level” on any Trading Day (as defined herein) means (A) with respect to the S&P 500 Index, the closing level of the S&P 500 Index as reported by S&P (as defined herein) (or of any successor index (as defined herein), as reported by the index sponsor of the successor index) on such Trading Day and (B) with respect to an iShares Fund (or of any successor fund (as defined herein)), the product of (i) the Closing Price (as defined herein) of one share of such iShares Fund on such Trading Day and (ii) the Adjustment Factor applicable to such iShares Fund (or to any successor fund) on such Trading Day, as determined by the Calculation Agent as described in “Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating To An iShares Fund; Discontinuance Of An iShares Fund; Alternate Calculation.”

      if the share (or any such other security) is listed or admitted to trading on a national securities exchange (other than The Nasdaq Stock Market), the last reported sale price, regular way, of the principal trading session on such day on the principal United States securities exchange registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, on which the share (or any such other security) is listed or admitted to trading;

      if the share (or any such other security) is a security of The Nasdaq Stock Market, the Nasdaq official closing price published by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. on such day; or

      if the share (or any such other security) is neither listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange but is included in the OTC Bulletin Board Service operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the last reported sale price of the principal trading session on the OTC Bulletin Board on such day.

If the shares of an iShares Fund (or any such other security) are listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange or are securities of The Nasdaq Stock Market but the last reported sale price or Nasdaq official closing price, as applicable, is not available pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the Closing Price for one share (or one unit of any such other security) on any Trading Day will mean the last reported sale price of the principal trading session on the over-the-counter market as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market or the OTC Bulletin Board on such day. If, because of a Market Disruption Event or otherwise, the last reported sale price or Closing Price, as applicable, for the share (or any such other security) is not available pursuant to either of the two preceding sentences, then the Closing Price for any Trading Day will be the mean, as determined by the Calculation Agent, of the bid prices for the share (or any such other security) obtained from as many recognized dealers in such security, but not exceeding three, as will make such bid prices available to the Calculation Agent. Bids of our affiliates may be included in the calculation of such mean, but only to the extent that any such bid is the highest of the bids obtained. The term “security of The Nasdaq Stock Market” will include a security included in any successor to such system, and the term OTC Bulletin Board Service will include any successor service thereto. See “Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating To An iShares Fund; Discontinuance Of An iShares Fund; Alternate Calculation.” 

The “Component Return” of a Basket Component will be equal to: 

\centered Final Component Level  Initial Component Level 

\centered Initial Component Level 

where, 

      the “Initial Component Level” is the Closing Level of such Basket Component on the Pricing Date; and

      the “Final Component Level” will be the Closing Level of such Basket Component on the Valuation Date.

The Initial Component Levels of the Basket Components are as follows: S&P 500 Index (1186.69); iShares MSCI EAFE Index Fund (54.43); iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (71.58); and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (42.05). 

“Face Amount” shall mean, when used with respect to any Security or Securities of this series, the amount set forth on the face of such Security or Securities as its or their “Face Amount.” 

The “Pricing Date” shall mean the date the notes were priced for initial sale to the public. 

^“Trading Day” means a day on which the New York Stock Exchange, The Nasdaq Stock Market, the American Stock Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, or any successor thereto, and the over-the-counter market for securities in the United States are open for trading during regular trading sessions. 

An “Underlying Index” means the MSCI EAFE Index; the Russell 2000 Index and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, as applicable. 

The “Valuation Date” will be the last Trading Day of [[Date 3: Date]], subject to postponement due to the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event. If a Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing with respect to a Basket Component on the scheduled Valuation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Closing Level of such Basket Component by reference to the Closing Level of such Basket Component on the next Trading Day on which there is not a Market Disruption Event for such Basket Component; provided, however, if a Market Disruption Event occurs with respect to a Basket Component on each of the five Trading Days following the originally scheduled Valuation Date, then (i) that fifth Trading Day will be deemed the Valuation Date for such Basket Component and (ii) the Calculation Agent will determine the Closing Level of such Basket Component subject to a Market Disruption Event based on its good faith estimate of the Closing Level on that fifth Trading Day. Notwithstanding a postponement of the Valuation Date with respect to a Basket Component that is subject to a Market Disruption Event, the originally scheduled Valuation Date will remain the Valuation Date for any Basket Component not subject to a Market Disruption Event. See “Market Disruption Events.” 

Discontinuance Of The S&P 500 Index; Alteration Of Method Of Calculation 

If Standard & Poor’s, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (“S&P”), discontinues publication of the S&P 500 Index and S&P or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the discontinued S&P 500 Index, then any subsequent Closing Level of the S&P 500 Index 

will be determined by reference to the level of such successor index or substitute index (in any such case, referred to herein as a “successor index”) at 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that any such subsequent Closing Level is to be determined. 

Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a successor index, we will promptly give notice to the Holders of the Securities of this series. 

If S&P discontinues publication of the S&P 500 Index prior to, and such discontinuance is continuing on, the date that any Closing Level of the S&P 500 Index is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no successor index is available at such time, then, on such date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Closing Level of the S&P 500 Index to be used in computing the amount payable at stated maturity. Such Closing Level will be computed by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the formula for and method of calculating the S&P 500 Index last in effect prior to such discontinuance, using the closing price (or, if trading in the relevant securities has been materially suspended or materially limited, its good faith estimate of the closing price that would have prevailed but for such suspension or limitation) at the close of the principal trading session on such date of each security most recently comprising the S&P 500 Index on the primary organized exchange or trading system. As it relates to the S&P 500 Index, “closing price” means, with respect to any security on any date, the last reported sales price regular way on such date or, in case no such reported sale takes place on such date, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices regular way on such date, in either case on the primary organized exchange or trading system on which such security is then listed or admitted to trading. 

If a successor index is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates a Closing Level as a substitute for the S&P 500 Index, such successor index or Closing Level will be used as a substitute for the S&P 500 Index for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists. 

If at any time the method of calculating the S&P 500 Index or a successor index, or the Closing Level thereof, is changed in a material respect, or if the S&P 500 Index or a successor index is in any other way modified so that such index does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the value of the S&P 500 Index or such successor index had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that any Closing Level of the S&P 500 Index is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a value of a stock index comparable to the S&P 500 Index or such successor index, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Closing Level and the amount payable at stated maturity with reference to the S&P 500 Index or such successor index, as adjusted. Accordingly, if the method of calculating the S&P 500 Index or a successor index is modified so that the level of such index is a fraction of what it would have been if it had not been modified (for example, due to a split in the index), then the Calculation Agent will adjust such index in order to arrive at a level of the S&P 500 Index or such successor index as if it had not been modified (for example, as if such split had not occurred). 

Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating To An iShares Fund; Discontinuance Of An iShares Fund; Alternate Calculation 

If the shares of an iShares Fund are subject to a stock split or reverse stock split, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor with respect to such shares will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor for such shares and the number of shares issued in such stock split or reverse stock split with respect to one such share. 

If an iShares Fund is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a “liquidation event”), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to such iShares Fund, then any subsequent Closing Level will be determined by reference to the Closing Price of the shares of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a “successor fund”). 

Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a successor fund, the Calculation Agent will give notice to the Holders of the Securities of this series. 

If an iShares Fund undergoes a liquidation event prior to, and such liquidation event is continuing on, the date that the Closing Level of such iShares Fund is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no successor fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Closing Price for such iShares Fund on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate such iShares Fund. 

If a successor fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Closing Price as a substitute for an iShares Fund, such successor fund or Closing Price will be used as a substitute for such iShares Fund for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists. 

If at any time the method of calculating an iShares Fund or a successor fund, or the Underlying Index, is changed in a material respect, or if an iShares Fund or a successor fund is in any other way modified so that such exchange traded fund does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the shares of an iShares Fund or such successor fund had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that any Closing Level of such iShares Fund is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a price of an exchange traded fund comparable to such iShares Fund or such successor fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Closing Level of such iShares Fund or such successor fund, as adjusted. 

Market Disruption Events 

**S&P 500 Index** 

^“Market Disruption Event” with respect to the S&P 500 Index will occur on any day if the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, any of the following: 

 A material suspension or material limitation of trading in [[Percentage 4]]% or more of the underlying stocks which then comprise the S&P 500 Index or any successor index has occurred on that day, in each case, during the one-hour period preceding the Close of Trading on the primary organized U.S. exchange or trading system on which those stocks are traded or, if in the case of a common stock not listed or quoted in the United States, on the primary non-U.S. exchange, trading system or market for that security. Limitations on trading during significant market fluctuations imposed pursuant to New York Stock Exchange Rule 80B or any applicable rule or regulation enacted or promulgated by The New York Stock Exchange, any other exchange, trading system or market, any other self regulatory organization or the Securities and Exchange Commission of similar scope or as a replacement for Rule 80B, may be considered material. For purposes of this certificate, “trading system” includes bulletin board services. 

 A material suspension or material limitation has occurred on that day, in each case during the one-hour period preceding the Close of Trading in options or futures contracts related to the S&P 500 Index or any successor index, whether by reason of movements in price exceeding levels permitted by the exchange, trading system or market on which those options or futures contracts are traded or otherwise. 

 Any event, other than an early closure, that materially disrupts or impairs the ability of market participants in general to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for, the securities that then comprise [[Percentage 4]]% or more of the S&P 500 Index or any successor index, at any time during the one-hour period preceding the Close of Trading on that day. 

 Any event, other than an early closure, that materially disrupts or impairs the ability of market participants in general to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for, the futures or options contracts relating to the S&P 500 Index or any successor index on the primary exchange or quotation system on which those futures or options contracts are traded, at any time during the one-hour period preceding the Close of Trading on that day. 

 The closure of an exchange, trading system or market on which the securities that then comprise [[Percentage 4]]% or more of the S&P 500 Index or any successor index are traded or which futures or options contracts relating to the S&P 500 Index or any successor index are traded prior to its scheduled closing time unless the earlier closing time is announced by such exchange, trading system or market at least one hour prior to the earlier of (i) the actual closing time for the regular trading session of the exchange, trading system or market and (ii) the submission deadline for orders to be entered in the exchange, trading system or market for execution on such trading day. 

For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred: 

 the relevant percentage contribution of a security to the level of the S&P 500 Index or any successor index will be based on a comparison of (x) the portion of the level of the S&P 500 Index attributable to that security and (y) the overall level of the S&P 500 Index, in each case immediately before the occurrence of the Market Disruption Event; and 

 “Close of Trading” means 4 p.m., New York City time. 

**iShares Funds** 

^“Market Disruption Event” with respect to an iShares Fund will occur on any day if the Calculation Agent determines any of the following: 

 A material suspension or material limitation of trading of the shares of such iShares Fund or any successor fund or of [[Percentage 4]]% or more of the underlying stocks which then comprise the related Underlying Index has occurred on that day, in each case, during the one-hour period preceding the Close of Trading on the Relevant Exchange(s). 

 A material suspension or material limitation of trading has occurred on that day, in each case during the one-hour period preceding the Close of Trading in options or futures contracts related to the shares of such iShares Fund or any successor fund or the related Underlying Index on the primary exchange or quotation system on which those futures or options contracts are traded, whether by reason of movements in price exceeding levels permitted by an exchange, trading system or market on which those options or futures contracts are traded or otherwise. 

 Any event, other than an early closure, that materially disrupts or impairs the ability of market participants in general to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for, the shares of such iShares Fund or any successor fund or the securities that then comprise [[Percentage 4]]% or more of the related Underlying Index, at any time during the one-hour period preceding the Close of Trading on that day. 

 Any event, other than an early closure, that materially disrupts or impairs the ability of market participants in general to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for, the futures or options contracts relating to such iShares Fund or any successor fund or the related Underlying Index on the primary exchange or quotation system on which those futures or options contracts are traded, at any time during the one-hour period preceding the Close of Trading on that day. 

 The closure of the Relevant Exchange on which the shares of such iShares Fund or any successor fund or the securities that then comprise [[Percentage 4]]% or more of the related Underlying Index are traded or on which futures or options contracts relating to such iShares Fund or any successor fund or the related Underlying Index are traded prior to its scheduled closing time unless the earlier closing time is announced by the Relevant Exchange at least one hour prior to the earlier of (i) the actual closing time for the regular trading session of the Relevant Exchange and (ii) the submission deadline for orders to be entered in the Relevant Exchange for execution at the Close of Trading on that day. 

For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred: 

 “Relevant Exchange” means the primary exchange or market of trading (which includes bulletin board services) for the shares of the iShares Fund or any successor fund or for any security then included in the related Underlying Index; 

 the relevant percentage contribution of a security to the level of the related Underlying Index will be based on a comparison of (x) the portion of the level of such Underlying Index attributable to that security and (y) the overall level of such Underlying Index, in each case immediately before the occurrence of the Market Disruption Event; 

 a decision to permanently discontinue trading in the relevant futures or options contracts or exchange traded funds will not constitute a Market Disruption Event; 

 limitations on trading during significant market fluctuations imposed pursuant to New York Stock Exchange Rule 80B or any applicable rule or regulation enacted or promulgated by The New York Stock Exchange, any other exchange, trading system or market, any other self regulatory organization or the Securities and Exchange Commission of similar scope or as a replacement for Rule 80B, may be considered material; and 

 “Close of Trading” means, in respect of any Relevant Exchange, the scheduled weekday closing time on a day on which the Relevant Exchange is scheduled to be open for trading for its respective regular trading session, without regard to after hours or any other trading outside the regular trading session hours.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the “Securities”), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of [[Date 4: Date]], as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the “Indenture”), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the “Trustee,” which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate Face Amount to $ ; *provided, however*, that the Company may, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, without the consent of the Holders of the Securities of this series, issue additional Securities with the same terms as the Securities of this series, and such additional Securities shall be considered part of the same series under the Indenture as the Securities of this series. 

The Securities of this series are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to [[Date 1]]. The Securities will not be entitled to any sinking fund. 

The Company agrees, to the extent permitted by law, not to voluntarily claim the benefits of any laws concerning usurious rates of interest against a Holder of Securities of this series. 

If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the Maturity Payment Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Maturity Payment Amount hereof calculated as though the date of acceleration was the Valuation Date; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the next Trading Day on which there is not a Market Disruption Event will be deemed to be the Valuation Date. Upon payment of the amount so declared due and payable, all of the Company’s obligations in respect of payment of the Maturity Payment Amount shall terminate. The Securities of this series will not bear a default rate of interest after the occurrence of an Event of Default or an acceleration under the Indenture. 

The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each beneficial owner of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, 

regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract with respect to the Basket Components. 

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected, acting together. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected by certain provisions of the Indenture, acting together, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with those provisions of the Indenture. Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Solely for the purpose of determining whether any consent, waiver, notice or other action or Act to be taken or given by the Holders of Securities pursuant to the Indenture has been given or taken by the Holders of Outstanding Securities in the requisite aggregate principal amount, the principal amount of this Security will be deemed to be equal to the amount set forth on the face hereof as the “Face Amount” hereof. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
