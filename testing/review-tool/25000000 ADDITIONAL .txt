^We refer to Clause 2.2 (Additional Facilities) of the Credit Agreement.

^This Agreement will take effect on the date on which the Facility Agent notifies UPC Broadband and the Additional Facility W Lenders that it has received the documents and evidence set out in Schedule 2 to this Agreement, in each case in form and substance satisfactory to it or, as the case may be, the requirement to provide any of such documents or evidence has been waived by the Facility Agent on behalf of the Additional Facility W Lenders (the **Effective Date**).

^We, the Additional Facility W Lenders, agree:

^^to become party to and to be bound by the terms of the Credit Agreement as Lenders in accordance with Clause 2.2 (Additional Facilities) of the Credit Agreement; and

^^to become party to the Security Deed as Lenders and to observe, perform and be bound by the terms and provisions of the Security Deed in the capacity of Lenders in accordance with Clause 9.3 (Transfers by Lenders) of the Security Deed.

Such commitment fee shall be calculated and shall accrue on a daily basis and shall be payable on the Effective Date and thereafter quarterly in arrears.

^(a) It is the intention of parties that the Existing Facility W be upsized by the amount of this Facility W in accordance with paragraph 17 of each Additional Facility Accession Agreement under which the Existing Facility W is made available and that from the first utilisation date of this Facility W, the Facility W Advance under this

Agreement will be consolidated with the Advances under the Existing Facility W and this Facility W and the Existing Facility W shall constitute one single Additional Facility for all purposes under the Credit Agreement.

^^Provided that any upsizing of Facility W permitted under this paragraph will not breach any term of the Credit Agreement, Facility W may be upsized by any amount, by the signing of one or more further Additional Facility W Accession Agreements, that specify (along with the other terms specified therein) UPC Financing as the sole Borrower and which specify Additional Facility W Commitments denominated in euros, to be drawn in euros, with the same Final Maturity Date and Margin as specified in this Additional Facility W Accession Agreement.

^^For the purposes of this paragraph 17 (unless otherwise specified), references to Additional Facility W Lenders and Facility W Advances shall include Lenders and Advances made under any such further and previous Additional Facility W Accession Agreement.

^^Where any Facility W Advance has not already been consolidated with any other Facility W Advance, on the last day of any Interest Period for such Facility W Advance, that Facility W Advance will be consolidated with any other Facility W Advance which has an Interest Period ending on the same day as that Facility W Advance, and all such Facility W Advances will then be treated as one Advance.

^Each of UPC Broadband and UPC Financing confirms, on behalf of themselves and each other Obligor that the representations and warranties set out in Clause 15 (Representations and Warranties) of the Credit Agreement (with the exception of Clauses 15.6(a) (Consents), 15.10 (Financial condition), 15.12 (Security Interests), 15.13(b) (Litigation and insolvency proceedings), 15.14 (Business Plan), 15.15 (Tax liabilities), 15.16 (Ownership of assets), 15.18 (Works Council), 15.19 (Borrower Group Structure), 15.20 (ERISA), 15.24 (UPC Financing) and 15.25 (Dutch Banking Act)) are true and correct as if made at the Effective Date with reference to the facts and circumstances then existing, and as if each reference to the Finance Documents includes a reference to this Agreement.

^Each Additional Facility W Lender confirms to each Finance Party that:
