Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein have the meaning set forth in the Plan.

^ \centered Section 1. AWARD SUBJECT TO PLAN

^ \centered Section 3. VESTING AND EXPIRATION 

[*Vesting schedule will be determined by the Committee. Certain agreements provide for cliff vesting, time vesting and/or vesting based upon the achievement of certain performance targets or maintenance of a certain stock price for a certain period of time*. *In case of vesting that is based on the satisfaction of performance targets or maintenance of a stock price,* t*he performance period typically will be one year and in all cases satisfaction of the performance criteria is required to be eligible to exercise the Option.*]  Subject to the provisions below, the right to exercise the Option shall expire on [*expiration date*].

If your employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries terminates for any reason other than death, Retirement, Disability or a Qualifying Termination within two (2) years following a Change of Control of the Company as determined by the Committee in accordance with the Plan then as of the date of such termination this Option shall expire as to any portion which has not then become vested and exercisable. If prior to the Option becoming vested and exercisable in full pursuant to the preceding paragraph, your employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries terminates by reason of your death, Disability or a Qualifying Termination within two (2) years following a Change of Control of the Company as determined by the Committee in accordance with the Plan, then any portion of this Option which has yet to become vested and exercisable shall become immediately vested and exercisable. However, if prior to the Option becoming vested and exercisable in full pursuant to the preceding paragraph, you Retire from the Company and you deliver a signed non-competition agreement to the Company in a form acceptable to the Company, then any portion of this Option which has yet to become vested and exercisable shall continue to vest and become exercisable as set forth in the preceding paragraph. Under all circumstances, any Option held less than one year from date of grant will be forfeited. Nothing in the Plan or this Option confers any right of continuing employment with the Company or its subsidiaries.

To the extent that this Option is exercisable after your termination of employment, after taking into account the vesting provisions set forth in this Section 3, then following such termination of employment this Option will expire on the **earlier** of (a) three (3) months following your termination of employment, if such termination occurred other than on account of death, Retirement or Disability, or a Qualifying Termination within two (2) years following a Change of Control of the Company; or (b) the third (3rd) anniversary of your final vest date, if such termination occurred on account of your death, Retirement, Disability, or a Qualifying Termination within two (2) years following a Change of Control of the Company.

For purposes of this Agreement, “**Retirement**” and “**Disability**” mean, respectively, your retirement or disability, all as determined in accordance with applicable Company personnel policies and the Plan policies. The term “**Qualifying Termination**” means your involuntary termination of employment by the Company without Cause or your resignation for Good Reason. For this purpose, “**Cause**” means your dishonesty, fraud, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty, conflict of interest, commission of a felony, material failure or refusal to perform your job duties in accordance with Company policies, a material violation of Company policy that causes harm to the Company or its subsidiaries or other wrongful conduct of a similar nature and degree and “**Good Reason**” means a material diminution of your compensation (including, without limitation, base compensation, annual bonus opportunities, and/or equity incentive compensation opportunities), a material diminution of your authority, duties or responsibilities, a material diminution in the authority, duties or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom you are required to report or a material diminution of the budget over which you retain authority.
