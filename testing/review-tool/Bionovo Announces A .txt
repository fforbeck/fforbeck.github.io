Emeryville, CA, [[Date 1: Date]] — Bionovo, Inc.

·   Under the Purchase Agreement, the sale price cannot be less than $[[USD Value 2: Number]] per share, which is above the most recent closing stock price.

·   There are no limitations on use of proceeds, financial or business covenants, restrictions on future fundings, rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the Purchase Agreement.

^more complete and detailed description of the agreement is set forth in the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

“We are extremely pleased with the commitment by Aspire Capital to participate in the corporate development of Bionovo. This agreement provides Bionovo access to capital as needed, demonstrates financial capability to our drug development investigators and to potential partnering candidates. We are dedicated to the development and commercialization of our promising pipeline of drug candidates, and to bring to the market safe and efficacious products that meet significant unmet medical needs in women’s health and cancer,” said Isaac Cohen, O.M.D., Bionovo’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

“Bionovo has historically pursued a financial strategy of raising capital only when that funding is needed. The intent of this agreement is to continue that strategy, to provide a flexible and fair source of committed capital, with a known cost - at market prices - and without warrant overhang. This agreement with Aspire meets that intent and provides the Company flexibility from a timing perspective and favorable terms,” said Tom Chesterman, Bionovo’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Given the strength of our current cash position, we expect to utilize this capital source very opportunistically. We are pleased to be working with a financial partner the caliber of Aspire Capital as we move forward to the next level of the development of Bionovo.”
