^^At any time upon the mutual consent of the parties;

^^By either party, without cause, upon 270 days’ prior written notice. Higher One will use its best efforts to effect a more expedient termination if the termination is prompted by any regulatory action or pending action against Bancorp;

^^Notwithstanding Section 1.5(a) above, if prior to the Release Date Frost has delivered a written notice to Bancorp Bank and Escrow Agent (i) specifying in reasonable detail the nature of any claim it may have under the Settlement Agreement and (ii) certifying that Frost has reasonably determined in good faith that it is unable to specify the amount of such Claim and that the amount of such Claim could equal or exceed the amount of the Escrow Deposit, then the entire Escrow Deposit shall be included in the Release Claim Amount; 

^^At least two (2) business days prior to any release to be made under this Section 1.5, the Escrow Agent shall send written notice to Bancorp Bank and Frost specifying the amount of such release. 

^^In the event of a dispute arising with respect to the rights of Frost or Bancorp Bank to receive the Escrow Deposit, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to place the Escrow Deposit, as the case may be, into court and commence an action in interpleader in order to obtain a judicial determination as to the party legally entitled to receive such amount. 

^^The Escrow Agent shall be entitled, upon execution of this Escrow Agreement and from time to time thereafter, (a) to receive reasonable compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder, which unless otherwise agreed in writing shall be as described in Schedule 1 attached hereto, and (b) to be reimbursed, upon request, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances, including without limitation reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses incurred or made by it in connection with the performance, modification and termination of this Escrow Agreement. Any such compensation or reimbursements shall be paid by Bancorp Bank. 

^^Upon receipt of a court order, the Escrow Agent shall act as instructed by such court order. 

^^The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error in judgment or for any act done or omitted by it in good faith, or for any mistake of fact or law and is released and exculpated from all liability hereunder, except for willful misconduct. 

^^The Escrow Agent shall not be required to take notice of any default by Frost or Bancorp Bank or to take any action, other than as provided in this Escrow Agreement. 

^^The Escrow Agent shall incur no liability in acting upon any signature, notice, request, waiver, consent, receipt, or other paper or document believed by the Escrow Agent to be genuine, and the Escrow Agent may assume that any person purporting to give the Escrow Agent any notice or advice in accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so, and Frost and Bancorp Bank each hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from and against any and all losses, costs, expenses, claims, damages and liabilities, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, which the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur as the Escrow Agent hereunder unless caused by the Escrow Agent’s willful refusal or willful failure to act pursuant to the terms hereof. 

^^The Escrow Agent shall not be under any obligation to take any legal action in connection with this Escrow Agreement or towards its enforcement or to appear in, prosecute or defend any action or legal proceeding that, in the opinion of the Escrow Agent, would or might involve the Escrow Agent in any cost, expense, loss or liability unless, and as often as required by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be furnished with security and indemnity satisfactory to the Escrow Agent against all such costs, expenses, losses or liability. 

^^Any notice given to any party hereto shall be in writing and simultaneously shall be sent to the other parties hereto. All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or sent (a) when received, if dispatched by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), (b) when received, if delivered in hand or by facsimile transmission with a copy thereof sent by reputable overnight courier which requires a signature of the receiving party, or (c) on the following business day, if dispatched by a reputable overnight courier which requires a signature of the receiving party, in each case to the party intended at its address as follows (or at such other address as may hereafter be specified by such party from time to time by like notices):
