^Admission of the Limited Partner. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1(f) of the Limited Partnership Agreement, the General Partner hereby designates a new series of Class D Common Units, which shall be “Class D-1 Common Units.” The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC has approved the award of Class D-1 Common Units under the Plan.

Upon such admission, the Limited Partner’s initial Capital Account balance shall be as set forth on Schedule A hereto. The Limited Partner is hereby designated as an “Original Partner” (for purposes of the Limited Partnership Agreement) by the General Partner and the rights, duties and obligations of the Limited Partner under the Limited Partnership Agreement following his admission to the Partnership shall, except to the extent modified by the terms of this Agreement, be the same as those of the previously admitted Original Partners thereunder. Following the Admission Date, the Limited Partner shall be eligible to participate in any benefit plans or programs sponsored or maintained by the Partnership and its Affiliates (including, without limitation, any life insurance, disability insurance and liability insurance), on the same general terms provided to other Individual Limited Partners. 

^Withdrawal, Vesting and Non-Compete Provisions. 

^^Withdrawal and Vesting Provisions. The following changes shall apply to the provisions of Sections 2.13(g), 8.3(a)(ii) and 8.4(b) of the Limited Partnership Agreement with respect to the Limited Partner and his Related Trusts, if any, and his or their Common Units: (i) references therein to the Closing Date shall be deemed to refer to the Admission Date, (ii) their Common Units shall be treated as Class A Common Units thereunder, and (iii) if any 

Class D-1 Common Units are reallocated thereunder, each Class D-1 Common Unit shall automatically convert into a Class A Common Unit upon such reallocation but will remain subject to the same vesting requirements as the Class D-1 Common Units of the Limited Partner had been before his Withdrawal. 

^^Non-Competition Covenant. Notwithstanding any provisions hereof or of the Limited Partnership Agreement to the contrary, the Restricted Period with respect to the Limited Partner shall, solely for purposes of Section 2.13(b)(i) of the Limited Partnership Agreement, conclude on the last day of the 12-month period immediately following the date of the Limited Partner’s Special Withdrawal or Withdrawal. 

^^Cross-References. References in the Limited Partnership Agreement to Sections thereof (including Sections 2.13(b), 2.13(g), 8.3(a)(ii) and 8.4(b)) that are modified by this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to such Sections as modified hereby.

^Miscellaneous.

^^This Agreement and any amendment hereto made in accordance with Section 4(b) hereof shall be binding as to executors, administrators, estates, heirs and legal successors, or nominees or representatives, of the Limited Partner, and may be executed in several counterparts with the same effect as if the parties executing the several counterparts had all executed one counterpart. 

^^If any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed invalid or unenforceable as written, it shall be construed, to the greatest extent possible, in a manner which shall render it valid and enforceable, and any limitations on the scope or duration of any such provision necessary to make it valid and enforceable shall be deemed to be part thereof, and no invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall affect any other portion of this Agreement unless the provision deemed to be so invalid or unenforceable is a material element of this Agreement, taken as a whole. 

^^The failure by any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement, or to require at any time performance by any party hereto of any provision hereof, shall in no way be construed as a waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof, or the right of any party hereto thereafter to enforce each and every such provision in accordance with its terms. 

^^The Limited Partner acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any conflict between the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement and the terms of this Agreement with respect to the rights and obligations of the Limited Partner, the terms of this Agreement shall control. Except as specifically provided herein, this Agreement shall not otherwise affect any of the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement.
