^^**Death or Disability.** Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2(a) hereof, in the event the Participant’s service on the Board is terminated due to the Participant’s death or Disability, any unvested portion of the SAR as of the date of such Participant’s termination of service shall immediately become fully vested and exercisable and, along with any unexercised vested portion of the SAR, shall remain exercisable until the earlier of:

^^^the Expiration Date; or

In the event of the Participant’s death, the Participant’s beneficiary or estate may exercise the vested SAR. 

^^**Retirement.** In the event the Participant’s service on the Board is terminated due to Retirement, any unexercised vested portion of the SAR as of the date of the Participant’s termination of service on the Board shall remain exercisable until the earlier of:

^^^the Expiration Date; or

^^^one (1) year after the date of the Participant’s termination of service on the Board due to Retirement.

For purposes of this SAR Agreement, “Retirement” means the Participant’s voluntary termination of service on the Board after attaining either:

^^^the Expiration Date; or

^^^ninety (90) days after the date of the Participant’s termination of service on the Board.

^^**Change in Control Vesting.** Subject to the provisions of Section 15 of the Plan, if a Change in Control occurs, [[Percentage 2]]% of the remaining unvested portion of the SAR shall be immediately vested and exercisable upon such Change in Control and, along with the unexercised vested portion of the SAR, shall remain exercisable through the Expiration Date.

^**Exercise of SAR.**

^^**Notice of Exercise.** Prior to the Expiration Date, the vested portion of the SAR may be exercised, in whole or in part, by delivering written notice to the Company in accordance with Section 7(k) hereof and in such form as the Committee may require from time to time. Such notice of exercise shall specify the number of SAR Shares to be exercised.

^^**Payment.** As of the date of exercise of the SAR, the Company shall settle the exercised portion of the SAR as provided in Section 7.5 of the Plan. The amount of the payment for each SAR Share exercised shall equal (i) the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise, less (ii) the SAR Price for each such exercised SAR Share. The exercised SAR shall be settled in whole shares of Stock, and cash for the value of a fractional share of Stock.

^^**Payment of Taxes.** If the Company is obligated to withhold an amount on account of any tax imposed as a result of the exercise of the SAR, the Participant shall be required to remit such amount to the Company, as provided in Section 17.1 of the Plan.

Alternatively, subject to Committee approval, the Participant may elect to withhold a portion of the SAR exercise payment equal to the minimum statutory tax that would be imposed on the exercise, as provided under Section 17.2 of the Plan. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Participant is responsible for the tax consequences associated with the grant of the SAR and its exercise. 

^^**Death Prior to Exercise.** In the event of the Participant’s death prior to the exercise of any vested portion of the SAR, the Participant’s beneficiary or estate may exercise the vested SAR.

^**Compliance with Federal and State Law.** The Company reserves the right to delay the Participant’s exercise of any portion of the SAR if (a) the Company’s issuance of Stock upon such exercise would violate any applicable federal or state securities laws or any other applicable laws or regulations, or (b) the Company reasonably determines that payment of such SAR portion would not be deductible under Code Section 162(m). The Participant may not sell or otherwise dispose of any portion of the SAR in violation of any applicable law. The Company may postpone issuing and delivering any Stock in payment for the exercise of such portion of the SAR for so long as the Company reasonably determines to be necessary to satisfy the following:

^^^its completing or amending any securities registration or qualification of the Stock or it or the Participant satisfying any exemption from registration under any federal or state law, rule, or regulation;

^^^its receiving proof it considers satisfactory that a person seeking to exercise the SAR after the Participant’s death is entitled to do so;

^^^Participant complying with any requests for representations under the Plan; and

^^^Participant complying with any federal, state, or local tax withholding obligations.

^**Changes in Company’s Capital Structure.** As may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee, in its complete and sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights, the Committee shall make or authorize to be made an adjustment in the number and class of SAR Shares and/or the SAR Price to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights, as a result of the following:

^^^any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other changes in the Company’s capital structure or its business; or

^^^any merger or consolidation of the Company; or

^^^any issuance of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Company’s Stock or the rights thereof; or

^^^the dissolution or liquidation of the Company; or

^^^any sale or transfer of all or any part of the Company’s assets or business; or

^^^any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.

^**Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete.** The Participant agrees to, understands and acknowledges the following:

^^**Confidential Information.** The Participant will be furnished, use or otherwise have access to certain Confidential Information of the Company and/or a Subsidiary. For purposes of this SAR Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any and all financial, technical, commercial or other information concerning the business and affairs of the Company and/or a Subsidiary that is confidential and proprietary to the Company and/or a Subsidiary, including without limitation:

^^^information relating to the Company’s or Subsidiary’s past and existing customers and vendors and development of prospective customers and vendors, including specific customer product requirements, pricing arrangements, payment terms, customer lists and other similar information;

^^^inventions, designs, methods, discoveries, works of authorship, creations, improvements or ideas developed or otherwise produced, acquired or used by the Company and/or a Subsidiary;

^^^the Company’s or Subsidiary’s proprietary programs, processes or software, consisting of, but not limited to, computer programs in source or object code and all related documentation and training materials, including all upgrades, updates, improvements, derivatives and modifications thereof and including programs and documentation in incomplete stages of design or research and development;

^^^the subject matter of the Company’s or Subsidiary’s patents, design patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade dress, manuals, operating instructions, training materials, and other industrial property, including such information in incomplete stages of design or research and development; and

^^other confidential and proprietary information or documents relating to the Company’s or Subsidiary’s products, business and marketing plans and techniques, sales and distribution networks and any other information or documents that the Company and/or a Subsidiary reasonably regards as being confidential.

The Company and its Subsidiaries devote significant financial, human and other resources to the development of their products, customer base and the general goodwill associated with their business, and the Company and its Subsidiaries diligently maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of their Confidential Information. Each and every component of the Confidential Information is sufficiently secret to derive economic value from its not being generally known to other persons. While serving on the Board and thereafter, the Participant will hold in the strictest confidence and not use in any manner which is detrimental to the Company or its Subsidiaries or disclose to any individual or entity any Confidential Information, except as may be required by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Participant’s service on the Board. 

All Company Materials are and will be the sole property of the Company and/or Subsidiary. The Participant agrees that during and after his or her service on the Board, the Participant will not remove any Company Materials from the business premises of the Company or a Subsidiary or deliver any Company Materials to any person or entity outside the Company or a Subsidiary, except as the Participant is required to do so in connection with performing the duties as a member of the Board. The Participant further agrees that, immediately upon the termination of his or her service on the Board for any reason, or during the Participant’s tenure as a member of the Board if so requested by the Company, the Participant will return all Company Materials and other physical property, and any reproduction thereof, excepting only the Participant’s copy of this Agreement. For purposes of this SAR Agreement, “Company Materials” means documents or other media or tangible items that contain or embody Confidential Information or any other information concerning the business, operations or future/strategic plans of the Company and/or any Subsidiary, whether such documents have been prepared by the Participant or by others. 

^^**Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete.** For the period beginning on the date hereof and ending twelve (12) months following the Participant’s termination of service on the Board, the Participant will not directly or indirectly:

^^^employ, recruit or solicit for employment any person who is (or was within the six (6) months prior to the date the Participant’s service on the Board terminated) an employee of the Company and/or any Subsidiary;

^^^accept employment, serve on the board of directors of, or engage in a competing business that may require contact, solicitation, interference or diverting of any of the Company’s or any Subsidiary’s customers, or that may result in the disclosure, divulging, or other use of Confidential Information or Company Materials acquired during the Participant’s service on the Board; or

^^^solicit or encourage any customer, vendor or potential customer or vendor of the Company or any Subsidiary with whom the Participant had contact while serving on the Board to terminate or otherwise alter his, her or its relationship with the Company. The Participant understands that any person or entity with whom the Participant contacted during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of the Participant’s termination of service on the Board for the purpose of soliciting sales from such person or entity shall be regarded as a “potential customer” of the Company to whom the Company or a Subsidiary has a protectable proprietary interest.

^^**Remedies for Violation.**

^^^**Injunctive Action.** The Participant acknowledges that if he or she violates the terms of this Section 6, the injury that would be suffered by the Company and/or a Subsidiary as a result of a breach of the provisions of this SAR Agreement (including any provision of Section 6(a) or (b) hereof) would be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to the Company and/or a Subsidiary for such a breach would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, the Company and/or its Subsidiary will have the right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce any provision of this SAR Agreement, and the Company and/or a Subsidiary will not be obligated to post bond or other security in seeking such relief. Without limiting the Company’s or Subsidiary’s rights under this Section 6(c) (or Sections 6(a) or (b) hereof) or any other remedies of the Company or a Subsidiary, if the Participant breaches any of the provisions of Section 6(a) or (b) hereof, the Company will have the right to cease making any payments otherwise due to the Participant under this SAR Agreement.

^^^**Forfeiture of the SAR and Repayment.** In addition to the rights available to the Company and its Subsidiaries under Section 6(c)(i) hereof, if the Participant violates the terms of this Section 6 at any time, the Participant, without any further action by the Company or the Participant, shall forfeit, as of the first day of any such violation, all right, title and interest to this SAR, any Stock or cash received from the exercise of the SAR, and any net proceeds received by the Participant pursuant to any sales of any such Stock prior to, on or after such date, and the Company shall have the right to issue a stop transfer order and other appropriate instructions to its transfer agent with respect to this SAR, and the Company further shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Participant of any fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in enforcing the Company’s or a Subsidiary’s rights under this Section 6. By accepting this SAR grant, the Participant hereby consents to a deduction from any amounts the Company or any Subsidiary owes to the Participant from time to time (including amounts owed to the Participant as wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation pay, as well as any other amounts owed to the Participant by the Company or any Subsidiary), unless such amount is subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent of any amounts that the Participant owes the Company under this Section 6. In addition to any injunctive relief sought under Section 6(c)(i) hereof and whether or not the Company or any Subsidiary elects to make any set-off in whole or in part, if the Company or any Subsidiary does not recover by means of set-off the full amount the Participant owes to the Company or any Subsidiary, calculated as set forth in this Section 6(c)(ii), the Participant agrees to immediately pay the unpaid balance to the Company or any Subsidiary.

^^**Enforceability of Restrictive Covenants.** The scope and duration of the restrictive covenants contained in this SAR Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect a legitimate, protectable interest of the Company and its Subsidiaries. However, if one or more provisions of this SAR Agreement are held to be unenforceable under applicable law to any extent, such provision(s) shall, to that extent, be excluded from this SAR Agreement and the balance of the SAR Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision(s) were so excluded to that extent and shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

^^**Written Acknowledgement by the Participant.** The Committee, in its sole discretion, may require the Participant, as a condition to the exercise of this SAR, to acknowledge in writing that he or she has not engaged, and is not in the process of engaging, in any of the activities described in this Section 6.
