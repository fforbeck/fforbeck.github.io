\centered LEASE

THIS LEASE is entered into to be effective on the 1st day of **[[Date 1: Date]],** by and between **B.S. ENTERPRISES**, a California general partnership (hereinafter referred to as “Lessor”) and [[Lessee]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (hereinafter referred to as “Lessee”).

^**Premises**: The Lessor hereby leases to the Lessee and the Lessee hereby hires from Lessor for the term, at the rental and upon the covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth, the premises, sometimes hereinafter referred to as the “Leased Premises”, more particularly described in Exhibit A, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, and commonly known as **335-A and 335-B Turtle Creek Court,** in the City of San Jose, County of Santa Clara, State of California, which premises consist of real property improved with a building and site improvements. **Upon the availability of 335-C and 335-D Turtle Creek Court**, Lessor shall lease said portion of the Leased Premises to Lessee upon the terms and conditions contained herein.

^**Rental**: Lessee shall pay to Lessor without deduction, set off, prior notice or demand, as rental in advance on the first day of each month during the term hereof the sum of **$[[USD Value 1: Number]] per month.** Lessee shall pay to Lessor monthly the sum of **$[[USD Value 2: Number]] for 335-D** and **$[[USD Value 3: Number]] for 335-C** upon the possession by Lessee of said portions of the Leased Premises.

^**Term**: The term of this Lease shall be for a period of five (5) full years commencing on the **1st day of July**, 1987, and ending on the **[[Date 2: Date]]**.

^**Option to Renew**: Lessee shall have the option to extend the term of this Lease for a total of four (4) additional five (5) year terms following expiration of the initial term as provided in Paragraph 3 hereinabove. Lessee shall exercise its option by giving notice of exercise of the option (the “option notice”) to Lessor at least six (6) months before the expiration of the initial term. With respect to any further renewal, Lessee shall give the option notice to Lessor at least six (6) months before the expiration of the additional renewal term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Lessee is in default of this Lease on the date of giving the option notice, the option notice shall be totally ineffective, or if Lessee is in default on the date the extended term is to commence, the extended term shall not commence and this Lease shall expire at the end of the initial term or the previously extended term, as the case may be. The monthly rent for the extended term shall be as determined by the mutual agreement of the parties; provided, however, if the parties cannot so agree, then such monthly rent shall be equal to the sum of: (i) the monthly rent in effect for the previous term and (ii) the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the first month of the previous term to the first month of the newly renewed term multiplied by the monthly rent in effect for the previous term.

^**Use**: Lessee shall use the premises for any lawful purpose.

^**Utilities**: Lessee shall pay for all water, sewage removal, fuel, gas, oil, heat, electricity, power, telephone, janitorial, landscaping and all other materials and services which may be furnished to or used in or about said premises during the term of this Lease.

^**Taxes**:  
^**Real Property**. Commencing on the lease commencement date and continuing for the entire term of this Lease as part of the consideration of this Lease and as additional rent hereunder, Lessee covenants and agrees to pay and discharge or cause to be paid and discharged promptly as the same become due and before delinquency, all taxes, assessments, rents and charges, license fees, municipal liens, levies, excise or imposts, whether general or special, ordinary or extraordinary, imposed by any governmental or quasi-governmental authority pursuant to law directly as a result of ownership of the Leased Premises located thereon which may be levied, assessed, charged or imposed, or may be or become a lien or charge upon the Leased Premises, or any part thereof or upon the leasehold or the estate hereby created, or upon the Lessor solely by reason of its ownership of the Leased Premises including without limitation any license or privilege fee or tax based and/or measured solely by the rentals due Lessor hereunder; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as imposing upon Lessee any obligation to pay any estate, inheritance, succession, capital levy or transfer tax of the Lessor growing out of or levied in connection with this Lease or the right in the Leased Premises or any tax measured by or based upon the net income of Lessor.

^Any sums above required to be paid by Lessee, which shall relate to a fiscal year during which the term of this Lease shall commence or terminate shall be prorated between Lessor and Lessee as of the date of such commencement or termination. If the law expressly permits the payment of such assessments in installments, Lessee may utilize the permitted installment method, but shall pay each installment coming due during the term hereof with any interest thereon before delinquency.

^Lessor shall make all payments of all sums required hereunder directly to the charging authority before delinquency and before any fine, interest or penalty shall become due or be imposed by operation of law for their nonpayment. If the law expressly permits the payment of any such sums in installments, Lessor may, at Lessor’s option, utilize the permitted installment payment method, but shall pay each installment with any interest before delinquency. Lessee shall reimburse Lessor within ten (10) days after payment by Lessor all amounts expended under this paragraph which relate to the Leased Premises.

^**Personal Property**. Lessee shall pay when due all taxes levied against personal property and trade fixtures on or about the premises prior to delinquency.

^**Fire and Property Damage Insurance**: Lessor shall maintain, as the minimum coverage required of it by this Lease, a policy or policies of fire and property damage insurance in so-called “fire and extended coverage” form insuring Lessor (and such others as Lessor may designate) against loss of rents for a period of not less than twelve (12) months and from physical damage to the building and other site improvements with coverage of not less than one hundred percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the full replacement value thereof. The foregoing notwithstanding, such fire and property damage insurance, at Lessor’s election, (i) may be written in so-called “all risk” form to include such perils as are commonly covered by such form of coverage, (ii) may be endorsed to cover loss caused by such additional perils against which Lessor may elect to insure, including earthquake and/or flood, and (iii) may contain “deductibles” not exceeding One Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 4: Number]]) per occurrence. Lessor shall not be required to cause such insurance to cover any trade fixtures, leasehold improvements, or any inventory or other personal property of Lessee. The cost of the insurance carried by Lessor pursuant to this section and any “deductible” amount not exceeding One Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 4]]) per occurrence paid by Lessor and excluded from the coverage of such insurance shall be reimbursed in full by Lessee.

^**Condition of Premises**: Lessee shall, at Lessee’s sole cost and expense, maintain, repair and keep the interior and exterior of the Leased Premises and each and every part thereof and all appurtenances (including without limitation, sidewalks fronting thereon, wiring, plumbing, sewage system, heating and air cooling installations, all glazing in or bordering the Leased Premises), in good condition and repair during the term of this Lease, damage thereto by fire, earthquake, act of God or the elements alone excepted. In the event Lessee should fail to make the repairs required of Lessee forthwith upon notice by Lessor, Lessor, in addition to all other remedies available hereunder by law, and without waiving any alternative remedies, may make the same and Lessee agrees to repay Lessor the cost as part of the rental payable as such on the next day upon which rent becomes due. Lessee waives all rights to make repairs at the expense of Lessor as provided for in any statute or law which may be now or hereafter enacted during the term of this Lease and agrees upon the expiration of the term of this Lease or sooner termination to surrender the Leased Premises in the same condition as received, ordinary wear and tear and damage by fire, earthquake or act of God.

^**Compliance With Laws**: Lessee shall not commit or permit to be committed any waste upon the Leased Premises, and shall not commit or permit to be committed any public or private nuisance, or any other act or thing prohibited by law. Lessee, at Lessee’s sole cost and expense, shall comply with all laws, ordinances, orders and regulations of all governmental authorities with respect to the use and occupancy of the premises. The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or the admission of Lessee in any action or proceeding against Lessee, whether Lessor be a party thereto, or not, that Lessee has violated any such law, ordinance, requirement or order in the use of the Leased Premises, shall be conclusive of that fact as between Lessor and Lessee.

^**Alterations**: Lessee shall not make any alteration, addition or improvement to the Leased Premises without first obtaining the written consent of Lessor. All such approvals, additions and improvements, including fixtures, made to or on the Leased Premises, except unattached movable business fixtures, shall be made at the sole cost and expense of Lessee and, upon completion, shall be the property of Lessor and shall become part of the Leased Premises and be surrendered to Lessor. Lessee shall provide Lessor with ten (10) days written notice before Lessee begins any such work, in order to allow Lessor adequate time to post notices of non-responsibility. Lessor shall notify Lessee within thirty (30) days before the end of this term whether Lessor desires to have Lessee remove all or any part of the alterations or improvements and to restore the Leased Premises to the condition existing prior to the alterations and improvements and Lessee shall remove all required items at Lessee’s sole cost and expense prior to expiration of the term of this Lease.

^**Liens**: Lessee shall keep the Leased Premises and building of which the Leased Premises are a part, free and clear of any liens and shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Lessor from any liens and encumbrances arising out of any work performed or materials or labor furnished by or at the direction of Lessee. In the event any lien is filed, Lessee shall do all acts necessary to discharge any lien within ten (10) days of filing, or if Lessee desires to contest any lien, then Lessee shall deposit with Lessor such security as Lessor shall demand to insure the payment of the lien claim. In the event Lessee shall fail to pay any lien claim when due or shall fail to deposit the security required hereunder with Lessor, then Lessor shall have the right to expend all sums necessary to discharge the lien claim, and Lessee shall pay as additional rental, when the next rental payment is due, all sums expended by Lessor in discharging any lien, including attorneys’ fees and costs.

^**Entry**: Lessor and Lessor’s agents may enter upon the Leased Premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same, to show the Leased Premises to a prospective purchaser or Lessee, or to make any changes or alterations or repairs, including the erection and maintenance of scaffolding, canopies and other structures as may be needed, which Lessor shall deem necessary for the protection, improvement or preservation of the Leased Premises, or to post any notice provided for by law, or otherwise to protect any and all rights of Lessor without any liability to Lessee for damages or any abatement of rental. Nothing contained in this paragraph 13 shall be construed to obligate Lessor to make any such changes, alterations or repairs. Lessee further agrees that at any time after one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the termination of this Lease, Lessor may place thereon any usual or ordinary “To Let” or “To Lease” signs.

^**Assignment and Subletting**: Lessee shall not sublet or assign any portion or interest in this Lease without first obtaining the written consent of Lessor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event of an attempted subletting or assignment without obtaining such consent, said subletting or assignment shall, at the option of the Lessor be void. Such assignment or subletting shall further, at the option of Lessor, be deemed a breach of this Lease.

^**Indemnification**: Lessee shall hold harmless, indemnify and defend Lessor from all liability, penalties, losses, damages, costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs of suit, expenses, causes of action, claims and/or judgments arising by reason of any injury or death to any person or persons, or damage to the property of any person or persons, (including without limitation, Lessee and Lessee’s servants, agents and employees), from any cause or causes whatsoever, while said person’s property are in, upon or in any way connected with the Leased Premises, during the term of this Lease or any occupancy hereunder.

Lessee, as a material part of the consideration to be rendered to Lessor, hereby waives all claims against Lessor for damages to goods, wares and merchandise in, upon or about said Leased Premises and for injuries to Lessee, his agents, or third persons in or about said Leased Premises from any cause arising at any time.

^**Insurance**: Lessee shall secure and maintain at its own expense during the term of this lease comprehensive public liability insurance with combined single limit coverage of One Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 5: Number]]). The coverage of Lessee’s liability insurance shall be primary and in addition to any carried by Lessor. Said insurance shall be in a company or companies qualified to do business in the State of California and satisfactory to Lessor and shall designate Lessor as an additional named insured thereunder and shall provide for ten (10) days notice to Lessor prior to cancellation or termination thereof. Lessee shall furnish evidence satisfactory to Lessor that such insurance has been obtained and that the premiums have been paid as required.

^**Waiver of Subrogation**: The parties hereto release each other, and their respective agents, employees, and contractors, from any claims for injury to any persons or damage to property that are caused by or result from risks insured against under any insurance policies carried by the parties and in force at the time of such damage, but only to the extent such claims are covered by such insurance. This release shall be in effect only so long as the applicable insurance policies contain a clause to the effect that this release shall not affect the right of the insured to recover under such policies. Each party shall cause each insurance policy obtained by it to provide that the insurance company waives all rights of recovery by way of subrogation against either party in connection with any damage covered by such policy so long as such waiver is available without unreasonable additional cost.

^**Default**: In the event of any default by Lessee, Lessor shall have the following remedies, in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by any law or otherwise provided in this Lease, to which Lessor may resort cumulatively, or in the alternative:

^Lessor may, at Lessor’s election, keep this Lease in effect and enforce by an action at law or in equity all of its rights and remedies under the Lease, including (i) the right to recover the rent and other sums as they become due by appropriate legal action, (ii) the right to make payments required of Lessee or perform Lessee’s obligations and be reimbursed by Lessee for the cost thereof with interest at twelve percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) per annum from the date the sum is paid by Lessor until Lessor is reimbursed by Lessee, and (iii) the remedies of injunctive relief and specific performance to compel Lessee to perform its obligations under this Lease.

^Lessor may, at Lessor’s election, terminate this Lease by giving Lessee written notice of termination, in which event this Lease shall terminate on the date set forth for termination in such notice. Any termination under this subparagraph shall not relieve Lessee from its obligation to pay any sums then due Lessor or from any claim against Lessor for damages or Monthly Rent. In no event shall any one or more of the following actions by Lessor, in the absence of a written election by Lessor to terminate this Lease, constitute a termination of this Lease:

^Appointment of a receiver or keeper in order to protect Lessor’s interest hereunder;

^Consent to any subletting of the Leased Premises or assignment of this Lease by Lessee, whether pursuant to the provisions hereof or otherwise; or

^Any other action by Lessor or Lessor’s agents intended to mitigate the adverse effects of any breach of this Lease by Lessee, including without limitation any action taken to maintain and preserve the Leased Premises or any action taken to relet the Leased Premises or any portions thereof, for the account of Lessee and in the name of Lessee.

^In the event Lessee breaches this Lease and abandons the Leased Premises, the Lease shall not terminate unless Lessor gives Lessee written notice of its election to so terminate this Lease. No act by or on behalf of Lessor intended to mitigate the adverse effect of such breach, including those described by subparagraphs B(l), (2) and (3) immediately preceding, shall constitute a termination of Lessee’s right to possession unless Lessor gives Lessee written notice of termination. Should Lessor not terminate this Lease by giving Lessee written notice, Lessor may enforce all its rights and remedies under this Lease, including the right to recover the rent as it becomes due under the Lease as provided in California Civil Code Section 1951.4, as in effect on the effective date of this Lease.

^In the event Lessor terminates this Lease, Lessor shall be entitled, at Lessor’s election, to damages in an amount as set forth in California Civil Code Section 1951.2 as in effect on the effective date of this Lease. For purposes of computing damages pursuant to said Section 1951.2, (i) twelve percent ([[Percentage 2]]%) interest per annum shall be used where permitted, and (ii) rent due under this Lease shall be prorated on a monthly basis where necessary to compute such damages. Such damages shall include without limitation:

^The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Lessee proves could be reasonably avoided, computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%); and

^Any other amount necessary to compensate Lessor for all detriment proximately caused by Lessee’s failure to perform Lessee’s obligations under this Lease, or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including, without limitation, the following:

^^^expenses for cleaning, repairing or restoring the Leased Premises; (ii) expenses for altering, remodeling or otherwise improving the Leased Premises for the purpose of reletting, including installation of leasehold improvements (whether such installation be funded by a reduction of rent, direct payment or allowance to a new tenant, or otherwise); (iii) broker’s fees, advertising costs and other expenses of reletting the Leased Premises; (iv) costs of carrying the Leased Premises, such as taxes, insurance premiums, utilities, and security precautions; (v) expenses in retaking possession of the Leased Premises; and (vi) attorneys’ fees and court costs incurred by Lessor in retaking possession of the Leased Premises and in re-leasing the Leased Premises or otherwise incurred as a result of Lessee’s default.

^Nothing in this paragraph shall limit Lessor’s right to indemnification from Lessee as provided in paragraph 15.

In the event Lessor fails to perform any of its obligations under this Lease and fails to cure such default within thirty (30) days after written notice from Lessee specifying the nature of such default where such default could reasonably be cured within said thirty (30) day period, or fails to commence such cure within said thirty (30) day period and thereafter continuously with due diligence prosecute such cure to completion where such default could not reasonably be cured within said thirty (3.0) day period, then Lessee shall have the following remedies only:

^Lessee may proceed in equity or at law to compel Lessor to perform its obligations and/or to recover damages proximately caused by such failure to perform (except to the extent Lessee has waived its right to damages result­ing from injury to person or damage to property as provided herein).

^Lessee, at its option, may cure any default of Lessor at Lessor’s cost. If Lessee at any time by reason of Lessor’s default reasonably pays any sum or does any act that requires the payment of any sum, the sum paid by Lessee shall be immediately due from Lessor to Lessee at the time the sum is paid, and shall bear interest at twelve percent ([[Percentage 2]]%) per annum from the date the sum is paid by Lessee until Lessee is reimbursed by Lessor.

^Lessee waives the provisions of Sections 1932(1), 1941 and 1942 of the California Civil Code and/or any similar or successor law regarding Lessee’s right to terminate this Lease or to make repairs and deduct the expenses of such repairs from the rent due under the Lease. Lessee hereby waives any right of redemption or relief from forfeiture under the laws of the State of California, or under any other present or future law, in the event Lessee is evicted or Lessor takes possession of the Leased Premises by reason of any default by Lessee.

^**Attorneys’ Fees Provision**: Should either party commence any legal action or proceeding against the other based on this lease, the prevailing party shall be entitled to a reasonable amount for attorneys’ fees.

^**Destruction**: In the event of a total or partial destruction of the Leased Premises during the term of this Lease from any cause actually covered by insurance then in full force and effect, Lessee immediately shall give written notice thereof to Lessor and Lessor shall to the extent of said insurance proceeds forthwith repair the same, provided such repairs can be made within one hundred twenty (120) days after such destruction, but such partial destruction shall in no way annul or void this Lease. If such repairs are not so insured or cannot be made within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of such destruction, this Lease may be terminated at the option of either party upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the other party. Lessee and Lessor waive the provisions of Sections 1932(2) and 1933(4) of the California Civil Code.

^**Condemnation**:  
^If any part of the Leased Premises be condemned for a public or quasi-public use by right of eminent domain, with out without litigation, or transferred by agreement in connection with such public or quasi-public uses, this Lease, as to the part so taken, shall terminate as of the date title shall vest in the condemnor, and the rent payable hereunder shall be adjusted so that Lessee shall be required to pay for the remainder of the term only such portion of such rent as the value of the Leased Premises remaining after condemnation bears to the value of the entire premises at the date of condemnation; but in either such event Lessor shall have the option to terminate this Lease as of the date when title to the part so condemned vests in the condemnor.

^In the event so much of the Leased Premises is taken that the remainder is not suitable for the purpose for which said premises were leased, this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such taking.

^All compensation awarded upon such condemnation or taking shall belong and be paid to Lessor and Lessee shall have no claim thereto, and Lessee hereby irrevocably assigns and transfers to Lessor any right to compensation or damages to which Lessee may become entitled during the term hereof by reason of the condemnation of all or a part of the Leased Premises; provided, Lessee shall receive any portion of such award specifically allocated to Lessee’s trade fixtures or moving expenses.

^**Holding Over**: Any holding over after the expira­tion of the term of this Lease by Lessee with the consent of Lessor shall be deemed to be a tenancy from month to month and except for the term thereof shall be on the same terms and conditions specified herein, so far as are applicable.

^**Sale of Premises**: In the event of a sale or conveyance by Lessor of Lessor’s interest in the Leased Premises, Lessor shall be released from any future liability under this Lease, with the successor in interest to Lessor to be solely liable to Lessee.

^**Subordination and Estoppel Certificate**: This Lease is and shall be subordinate to any mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument of security which have been or shall be placed on the land and building or land or building of which the Leased Premises form a part, and such subordination is hereby made effective without any further act by Lessee. Lessee agrees that at any time or from time to time upon request by Lessor to execute and deliver any instruments, releases or other documents that may be required in connec­tion with subjecting and subordinating this Lease to the lien of said mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument of security. Lessee hereby appoints Lessor as Lessee’s attorney in fact, irrevocably, to execute and deliver any such instruments. Lessee shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to Lessor, at any time within ten (10) days after request by Lessor, a statement in writing certifying, if such be the case, that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been modifications, that this Lease is in full force and effect as modified), the date of com­mencement of the Lease, the date on which the rent has been paid, and such other information as Lessor shall reasonably request. Such statement by Lessee shall be used by Lessor for delivery to and reliance upon by prospective purchasers and lenders whose security consists of liens upon the building and the real property of which the Leased Premises are a part.

^**Notice**: All notices or demands of any kind re­quired or desired to be given by Lessor or Lessee hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed delivered forty-eight (48) hours after depositing the notice or demand in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to Lessee at the address of the Leased Premises, whether or not Lessee has departed therefrom, abandoned or vacated the Leased Premises, and as to Lessor at 335-B Turtle Creek Court, San Jose, California 94125, or as Lessor shall designate in writing.

^**Waiver**: No covenant, term or condition or breach thereof shall be deemed waived, except by written consent of Lessor, and any waiver or the breach of any covenant, term or condition shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other covenant, term or condition. Acceptance of all or any portion of rent at any time shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any covenant, term or condition except as to the rent payment accepted.

^**CPI**: The term “CPI” shall mean the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Subgroup “All Items”, San Francisco-Oakland Metropolitan Area (1967 = 100), now being published bi-monthly by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the CPI is changed so that the base year is altered from that used as of the effective date of this Lease, then the CPI shall be converted in accordance with the conversion factor published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, to obtain the same result that would have been obtained had the base year not been changed. If no conversion factor is available, or if the CPI is otherwise changed, revised or discontinued for any reason, there shall be substituted in lieu thereof and the term “CPI” shall thereafter refer to the most nearly comparable official price index of the United States Govern­ment in order to obtain substantially the same result for any adjustment required by this Lease as would have been obtained had the original CPI not been discontinued, revised or changed.

^**Miscellaneous**:  
^All the agreements herein contained upon the part of Lessee, whether technically covenants or conditions, shall be deemed conditions for the purpose hereof, conferring upon Lessor, in the event of breach of any of said agreements, the right to terminate this Lease.

^The captions of the paragraphs contained in this Lease are for convenience only and shall not be deemed in resolving any question of interpretation or construction of any paragraph of this Lease to be relevant.

^All of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs, executors and administrators, successors and assigns, except that nothing in this provision shall be deemed to permit any assignment, subletting or use of the Leased Premises other than as provided for herein.

^This Lease shall be governed and interpreted solely by the laws of the State of California then in force.

^Each number, singular or plural, as used in this Lease shall include all numbers, and each gender shall be deemed to include all genders.

^Time is of the essence of this Lease and each and every provision hereof, except as to the conditions relating to the delivery of possession of the premises to Lessee.

^All the terms, covenants and conditions contained in this Lease to be performed by Lessee, if Lessee shall consist of more than one person or organization, shall be deemed to be joint and several, and all rights and remedies granted to Lessor or given to Lessor by law shall be cumulative and non-exclusive of any other remedy.
