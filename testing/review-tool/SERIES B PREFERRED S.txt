No representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement nor any schedules or exhibits attached hereto or any certificate furnished or to be furnished to Investor at the Closing, nor the last version of any financial projections provided by Company to the Investors (to the extent so provided) contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made, except that with respect to any financial projections presented by the Company to Investor, the Company represents only that the projections were prepared by the management of the Company in a good faith effort to describe the Company’s presently proposed business and products and the markets therefor; provided, however, that the Company does not warrant that it will achieve any of such projections.

^^**Permits****.** The Company has all franchises, permits, licenses and any similar authority necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted, the lack of which would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company believes it can obtain, without undue burden or expense, any similar authority for the conduct of its business as planned to be conducted. The Company is not in default in any material respect under any of such franchises, permits, licenses or other similar authority.

^^**Business Practices****.** Neither the Company nor, to the Company’s knowledge, any person acting on behalf of the Company has paid or delivered, or promised to pay or deliver, directly or indirectly through any other person, any monies or anything else of value to any government official or employee of any political party, for the purpose of illegally or improperly inducing or rewarding any action by the official favorable to the Company.

^^**Real Property Holding Corporation**.** The Company is not now and never has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as defined in §897(c)(2) of the Code and Treasury Regulation §1.897-2(b), and has filed with the Internal Revenue Service all statements, if any, with its United States income tax returns, which are required under Treasury Regulation §1.897-2(h). The Company shall provide prompt notice to the Investors following any “determination date” (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(c)(1)) on which the Company becomes a United States real property holding corporation. In addition, upon a written request by an Investor, the Company shall provide such Investor with a written statement informing such Investor whether such Investor’s interest in the Company constitutes a United States real property interest. The Company’s determination shall comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(1) or any successor regulation, and the Company shall provide timely notice to the Internal Revenue Service, in accordance with and to the extent required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2) or any successor regulation, that such statement has been made. The Investors will reasonably cooperate with the Company’s efforts to make the determination as to whether the Company qualifies as a real property holding corporation by furnishing the Company with any information reasonably necessary for the Company to make the determination described in this Section 2.23. The Company’s written statement to an Investor shall be delivered to such Investor within 10 days of the Investor’s written request therefor, **provided**, however**, that such 10-day notice period shall be tolled pending receipt from the Investor of the information reasonably required by the Company to make the requested determination. The Company’s obligation to furnish such written statement shall continue notwithstanding the fact that a class of the Company’s stock may be regularly traded on an established securities market or the fact that there is no preferred stock then outstanding.

^^**Insurance****.** The Company has in full force and effect insurance policies sufficient in amount (subject to reasonable deductibles) to allow it to replace any properties or assets that might be damaged or destroyed. All of the Company’s insurance policies are set forth in Section 2.24 of the Schedule of Exceptions. The Company is not in default with respect to any material provision contained in any such policy, and the Company has not received notice of cancellation or non-renewal thereof.

^^**Related Transactions****.** (a) There is no indebtedness, either directly or indirectly, between the Company and any Founder, present or former officer, director, employee or shareholder, or to any of their respective parents, spouses or children, in any amount whatsoever, other than travel, relocation and other expenses which are advanced and reimbursed in the ordinary course of business; (b) no Founder, present or former officer, director, employee or shareholder (nor any person in the immediate family of any such officer, director, employee or shareholder), has any material direct or indirect ownership interest in any firm or corporation with which the Company is affiliated or with which the Company has a business relationship that is material to the Company or which competes with the Company; (c) no Founder, officer, director, employee, consultant or shareholder of any of its shares or any member of their immediate families is, directly or indirectly, interested in any contract with the Company; and (d) the Company is not a guarantor or indemnitor of any indebtedness of any person, firm or corporation.

^^**Environmental and Safety Laws**.** The Company is not in violation of any applicable statute, law or regulation relating to the environment or occupational health and safety, and to its knowledge, no material expenditures are or will be required in order to comply with any such existing statute, law or regulation. No action, proceeding, permit revocation, writ, injunction or claim is pending or, to the Company’s knowledge, threatened concerning the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ facilities and the Company is not aware of any fact or circumstance which could involve the Company or any of its subsidiaries in any environmental litigation or impose any material environmental liability upon the Company. As of the Closing, to the Company’s knowledge, no Hazardous Material (as defined below) is present on any Company or subsidiary facility and, to the Company’s knowledge, no reasonable likelihood exists that any Hazardous Material present on other property will come to be present on a Company or subsidiary facility. The Company has obtained all indemnification agreements from all prior owners, lessors and/or operators of any property on which a Company or a subsidiary facility is located required to be obtained under any written agreements between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) and any current owner of such property, indemnifying the Company with respect to any liability relating to or arising from the presence of or migration of any Hazardous Material at such facilities with respect to periods prior to the Company or subsidiaries’ use of such facilities. There are no underground storage tanks, asbestos or PCBs present on any Company facility. For the purposes of this Section 2.26, the term “*Hazardous Material***” shall mean any material or substance that is prohibited or regulated by any environmental law or that has been designated by any governmental authority to be radioactive, toxic, hazardous or otherwise a danger to health, reproduction or the environment.

^^**Investment Company Act****.** The Company is not an “investment company,” or a company “controlled” by an “investment company,” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

^^**Use of Proceeds; Budgeting; Reporting**.** The Company shall use the proceeds from the sale of the Series B Stock for working capital and general corporate purposes as set forth in the Company’s 2009 business plan and annual budget, substantially in the form of **Exhibit L** attached hereto, which will be approved by the Investors prior to the First Closing (the “*Annual Budget***”).

^**REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OF THE INVESTORS****.** Each Investor hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company, with respect to the purchase of the Series B Stock and the Conversion Shares as follows, which representations and warranties and agreements in no way limit or affect the Company’s representations and warranties hereunder:

^^**Authorization****.** This Agreement constitutes the Investor’s valid and legally binding obligation, enforceable in accordance with its terms except as may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, (b) applicable federal or state securities law limits on indemnification and (c) the effect of rules of law governing the availability of equitable remedies. The Investor represents that it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the Related Agreements.

^^**Purchase for Own Account****.** The Purchased Shares to be acquired by the Investor hereunder will be acquired for investment for such Investor’s own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the public resale or distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act, and such Investor has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same, all other than by such Investor to affiliated funds under common control. If not an individual, the Investor also represents that it has not been formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the Purchased Shares.

^^**Disclosure of Information****.** At no time was the Investor presented with or solicited by any publicly issued or circulated newspaper, mail, radio, television or other form of general advertising or solicitation in connection with the offer, sale and purchase of the Purchased Shares. The Investor acknowledges that the Company is in the very early stages of development and therefore its future plans are highly speculative. The Investor has received or has had full access to all the information it considers necessary or appropriate to make an informed investment decision with respect to the Purchased Shares to be purchased by such Investor under this Agreement and acknowledges that the business plans of the Company provided to the Investor (including any financial information and/or projections) were necessarily incomplete and were intended only to give the Investor a general idea of the Company’s future intentions. The Investor further has had an opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the Company regarding the terms and conditions of the offering of the Purchased Shares and to obtain additional information (to the extent the Company possessed such information or could acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense) necessary to verify any information furnished to such Investor or to which such Investor had access. The foregoing, however, does not in any way limit or modify the representations and warranties made by the Company in Section 2.

^^**Investment Experience**.** The Investor understands that the purchase of the Purchased Shares involves substantial risk. The Investor: (a) has experience as an investor in securities of companies in the development stage and acknowledges that the Investor is able to fend for itself, can bear the economic risk of such Investor’s investment in the Purchased Shares and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that such Investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of this investment in the Purchased Shares and protecting its own interests in connection with this investment and/or (b) has a preexisting personal or business relationship with the Company and certain of its officers, directors or controlling persons of a nature and duration that enables such Investor to be aware of the character, business acumen and financial circumstances of such persons. The Investor represents that (i) if the Investor is an individual, he or she resides in the state identified on **Exhibit A**, and (ii) if the Investor is an entity, then the office in which its investment decision was made is located at the address on Exhibit A**.

^^**Accredited Investor Status****.** The Investor is an “accredited investor” within the meaning of Regulation D, Rule 501(a), promulgated under the Securities Act.

^^**Restricted Securities****.** The Investor understands that the Purchased Shares and the Conversion Shares are characterized as “restricted securities” under the Securities Act inasmuch as they are being acquired from the Company in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under the Securities Act and applicable regulations thereunder such securities may be resold without registration under the Securities Act only in certain limited circumstances. In this connection, Investor represents that Investor is familiar with Rule 144 of the Securities Act, as presently in effect, and understands the resale limitations imposed thereby and otherwise by the Securities Act. Investor understands that the Company is under no obligation to register any of the securities sold hereunder except as provided in the Investors’ Rights Agreement. Investor understands that no public market now exists for any of the Purchased Shares and that it is uncertain whether a public market will ever exist for the Purchased Shares or the Conversion Shares.

^^**Further Limitations on Disposition****.** Without in any way limiting the representations set forth above, such Investor further agrees not to make any disposition of all or any portion of the Purchased Shares or the Conversion Shares unless and until:

^^there is then in effect a registration statement under the Securities Act covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made in accordance with such registration statement; or

^^the Investor shall have notified the Company of the proposed disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and, at the expense of Investor or its transferee, with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such disposition will not require registration of such securities under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) above, no such registration statement or opinion of counsel shall be required: (i) for any transfer of any Purchased Shares or Conversion Shares in compliance with Rule 144 or Rule 144A, or (ii) for any transfer of Purchased Shares or Conversion Shares by an Investor that is a partnership, limited liability company, or a corporation to (A) a partner of such partnership, a member or manager of such limited liability company, or shareholder of such corporation, (B) a retired partner of such partnership, a retired member of such limited liability company who retires after the date hereof, (C) the estate of any such partner, member or shareholder, (D) an “affiliate” (as defined in Section 7.2 below) or (iii) for the transfer by gift, will or intestate succession by any Investor to his or her spouse or lineal descendants, siblings or ancestors or any trust for any of the foregoing; **provided** that in each of the foregoing cases the transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms of this Section 3 (other than Section 3.5) to the same extent as if the transferee were an original Investor hereunder.

^^**Legends****.** It is understood that the certificates evidencing the Purchased Shares and the Conversion Shares will bear the legends set forth below:

^^THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”), OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF CERTAIN STATES. THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE ACT AND THE APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION THEREFROM. INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO BEAR THE FINANCIAL RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER TO THE EFFECT THAT ANY PROPOSED TRANSFER OR RESALE IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

^^Any legend required by the Related Agreements.

^^Any legend required by the laws of the State of California, including any legend required by the California Department of Corporations and Sections 417 and 418 of the California Corporations Code or any other state securities laws, including a legend substantially in the form of the following:

THE SHARES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE (I) ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO AUTOMATIC CONVERSION THEREOF AND (II) AUTOMATICALLY CONVERT INTO COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY IN THE EVENT OF A PUBLIC OFFERING MEETING CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS OR UPON CERTAIN CONSENTS OF THE HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY’S PREFERRED STOCK, ALL PURSUANT TO AND UPON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SPECIFIED IN THE COMPANY’S AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. A COPY OF SUCH AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION MAY BE OBTAINED, WITHOUT CHARGE, AT THE COMPANY’S PRINCIPAL OFFICE.

The legend set forth in (a) above shall be removed by the Company from any certificate evidencing Purchased Shares or Conversion Shares if a registration statement under the Securities Act is at that time in effect with respect to the legended security or upon delivery to the Company of an opinion by counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such security can be freely transferred in a public sale without such a registration statement being in effect and that such transfer will not jeopardize the exemption or exemptions from registration pursuant to which the Company issued the Purchased Shares or Conversion Shares.

Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any party of any breach or default under this Agreement, or any waiver on the part of any party of any provisions or conditions of this Agreement, must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by law or otherwise afforded to any party to this Agreement, shall be cumulative and not alternative.

^^**Arbitration****.** Any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement involving the interpretation or enforcement of any provision of this Agreement or breach hereof or otherwise arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be submitted to binding arbitration in Orange County, California, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (expedited procedures) then in effect. There shall be three (3) arbitrators, all of whom shall be neutral, and at least one (1) of whom shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California for at lease ten (10) years. The arbitrators shall have the authority to exclude evidence found to be irrelevant, redundant, or prejudicial beyond its probative value, and are instructed to exercise that authority consistently with reasonably expediting the proceeding. The arbitrators may order specific performance, preliminary and final injunctive relief, and other equitable relief. The arbitrators may make awards to the substantially prevailing party in their discretion and all fees, costs, and expenses of enforcing any right of such substantially prevailing party under or with respect to this Agreement, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and accountants. The award or order of the arbitrators may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

The arbitrators’ award shall be issued within 30 days after the hearing is closed.

^^**Injunctive Relief**. The Parties agree that damages cannot reasonably compensate the Parties in the event of a violation of the covenants and restrictions in this Agreement and that it may be difficult to ascertain the damages which would be suffered by the Parties in such cases. Accordingly, the Parties hereby agree and consent that, in the event of any such actual or threatened breach or violation, notwithstanding Section 7.19, any party may obtain injunctive relief in order to prevent the potential or continuing violation of the terms of this Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction located in Orange County, California; provided, however, that any determination of the fair market value of securities shall be made by binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.19 above, and such arbitration may proceed concurrently with any action for injunctive relief. The award of permanent or temporary injunctive relief shall in no way limit any other remedies to which a party may be entitled as a result of any such breach.

^^**Corporate Securities Law****.** THE SALE OF SECURITIES WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS AGREEMENT HAS NOT BEEN QUALIFIED WITH THE COMMISSIONER OF CORPORATIONS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH SECURITIES OR THE PAYMENT OR RECEIPT OF ANY PART OF THE CONSIDERATION THEREFOR PRIOR TO SUCH QUALIFICATION IS UNLAWFUL UNLESS THE SALE OF SECURITIES IS EXEMPT FROM QUALIFICATION BY SECTION 25100, 25102, OR 25105 OF THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE. THE RIGHTS OF ALL SUCH PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON SUCH QUALIFICATION BEING OBTAINED, UNLESS THE SALE IS SO EXEMPT.

^^You also agree that you will assist the Company in applying for and obtaining both domestic and foreign patents, as the case may be, on all Confidential Information, Inventions and Works, Materials and Proprietary Rights that the Company deems to be patentable, and that you will execute all documents and perform all acts which the Company reasonably deems necessary or desirable to obtain such patents or otherwise to vest in the Company full and exclusive right, title and interest in and to the Invention and Work, to protect the same against infringement by others and otherwise to aid the Company in connection with any continuations, renewals or reissues of any patents, or in the conduct of any proceedings or litigation in regard thereto.

^^Additionally, you agree that, upon the earlier of either the written request of the Company or upon termination of your Employment, you will deliver to the Company all Confidential Information that you have in your possession or control.

^^In order to avoid any ambiguity in connection with the creation of any Invention and Work, you agree to disclose in writing to the Company complete details on any work, invention or creation that was devised, developed, designed, discovered or reduced to practice by you prior to the time you were Employed by the Company and any Inventions and Works that are devised, developed, designed, discovered or reduced to practice by you at any time while you are or have been Employed by the Company. Such disclosure shall be made at the time you sign this Agreement with respect to any work, invention or creation that was devised, developed, designed, discovered or reduced to practice by you prior to the time you were Employed by the Company, and promptly upon development, design or discovery of any Inventions and Works, and shall be disclosed in writing pursuant to the form attached as **Exhibit “A**” to this Agreement, or such other form as the Company, respectively, may from time to time provide.

^**Covenant Not to Solicit or Hire.**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event of a conflict any term of this Agreement and your Employment Agreement, the terms of your Employment Agreement shall govern.

^**Business Opportunities.**

^**Notices.**  
Any notice to the Company required or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing to the Company, either by personal service, overnight courier, or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, duly addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company at its then principal place of business.

^**Miscellaneous Provisions.**  
^^**Injunctive Relief**. You agree that in the event of any breach by you of any of the covenants and agreements set forth in **Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8** hereof, the Company would suffer great and irreparable harm, injury and damage, the Company would encounter extreme difficulty in attempting to prove the actual amount of damages suffered by the Company as a result of such breach, and the Company would not be reasonably or adequately compensated in damages in any action at law.

^^**Successors and Assigns**. This Agreement shall be binding on the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Your duties, obligations, rights and privileges hereunder may not be delegated or assigned by you in any manner without the Company’s prior written consent, which shall be provided or withheld in the Company’s sole discretion.

^^**Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes or is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction such provision shall be deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws of such jurisdiction so as to be valid and enforceable or, if it cannot be so amended without materially altering the intention of the parties, it will be stricken, but the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby in any other jurisdiction and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

^^**Controlling Law**. ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS APPLIED TO RESIDENTS OF THAT STATE ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS TO BE PERFORMED SOLELY WITHIN SUCH STATE.

^^**Waiver**. Waiver by either of the parties of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereof.

^^**Survival of Your Obligations**. Your obligations hereunder shall survive the termination of your Employment with the Company or the rendering of services to the Company, as applicable, regardless of the reason or cause for such termination.

^^**Attorneys’ Fees**. The prevailing party in any litigation instituted under this Agreement shall, in addition to other remedies, be entitled to be reimbursed by the other party for all expenses of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.

^^**Prior Employment**. So as to avoid any potential liability of the Company for your prior actions, you hereby represent and warrant to the Company that, except as otherwise disclosed to the Company in writing, you are not a party to any confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-solicitation, non-competition or similar agreement with any former employer and that the performance of your duties for the Company will not breach any agreement with, or obligation owed to, a former employer.

^^**Notification of Subsequent Employer**. The Company may, without notifying you, notify any of your subsequent employers of your rights and obligations under this Agreement.

^^**Inspection of Files**. You acknowledge and agree that any property situated on the Company's premises, including disks and other storage media, filing cabinets or other work areas, is subject to inspection by Company personnel at any time without notice.
