The Borrowing Certificate must reflect the Advance Formula and the Loan Account as of the certificate date. A Borrowing Certificate may be submitted daily to Crestmark, but in all events, must be submitted at least on a weekly basis.

**Certificate, Borrower is reaffirming that no Default exists to the best of its knowledge after diligent inquiry as of the date of the requested borrowing and remaking each of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement.**

^^**Disputes with Account Debtors:**Borrower will immediately notify Crestmark of any invoices that have been rejected or the amount thereof disputed, in whole or in part, by any Account Debtor. These invoices will then be eliminated as an Eligible Account Receivable. Borrower must also immediately inform Crestmark of Borrower's receipt of written or verbal notice of the rejection of goods or services by any Account Debtor, delays in delivery of goods, non-performance of contracts or services, and of any assertion or threatened assertion of any claims, offsets or counterclaims by Account Debtors.

^^**Commitment Fee:**At closing, Borrower will pay Crestmark a non-refundable Commitment Fee in the aggregate amount of one percent (1 %) of the Maximum Amount for the extension of the Loan, which fee has been fully earned by Crestmark by its execution of this Agreement. On each one year anniversary of this Agreement, if any Indebtedness is still outstanding, or this Agreement is still in effect, Borrower will pay Crestmark a renewal fee of one percent ([[Percentage 5: Number]]%) of the Maximum Amount, which fee will be fully earned by Crestmark on each anniversary date. As a courtesy to Borrower, the Commitment Fee may be paid in twelve (12) equal consecutive monthly payments commencing on date of execution of this Agreement, or for any later Commitment Fee, the anniversary of the date of execution of this Agreement, and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter.

^^**Monthly Maintenance Fee:**Each month Borrower will pay Crestmark a monthly maintenance fee of FOUR-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT ([[Percentage 6: Number]]%) of the monthly average principal balance of the Loan outstanding from the preceding month as a maintenance fee commencing on the tenth (10th) day of [[Date 2: Date]] and continuing on the tenth (10th) day of each month thereafter until Borrower has no Indebtedness outstanding and this Agreement is terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the foregoing maintenance fee will be a minimum of TWO-THOUSAND FIVE-HUNDRED DOLLARS AND NO/100 ($[[USD Value 3: Number]]) per month until this Agreement is terminated and Crestmark is repaid the Indebtedness in full, including any exit fee contained in the Note.

^^**Exit Fee:**Borrower will pay Crestmark an exit fee as set forth in the Note.

^^**Reserves Against Availability:**If Crestmark, in its sole reasonable discretion, exercised in a commercially reasonable manner, believes that the prospect for repayment of any Indebtedness is jmpaired, its Collateral margin is insufficient, or any other issues, circumstances or facts have arisen that could otherwise negatively impact Borrower, its business, financial condition or assets, Crestmark may establish reasonable cash reserves and credit balances to protect its interests and the repayment of the Indebtedness. In addition, Crestmark may also establish a Dilution Reserve, as defined below. The reserve may be funded by reducing the Advance Formula to achieve the target reserve level, withholding monies due Borrower from any collections Crestmark receives, from a cash payment from Borrower or any other method Crestmark chooses in its reasonable discretion after notice to Borrower. The reserve will be in such amounts as Crestmark, in its sole reasonable discretion, deems appropriate. Money in the reserve account will not earn interest for Borrower, and Crestmark may apply the funds in the Reserve to reduce the Indebtedness at any time Crestmark elects, regardless of whether a Default exists.

"Dilution Reserve" means the Dilution Percentage less the Base Dilution. The Dilution Percentage is defined as: (i) uncollectable sales (as determined by Crestmark in its sole discretion, exercised in a commercially reasonable manner, and including all sales subject to a customer dispute) divided by (ii) total sales and (iii) stated as a percentage, as reasonably determined by Crestmark. Base Dilution means: five percent ([[Percentage 4]]%). Crestmark shall reserve the advance rate for Eligible Accounts by one percent ([[Percentage 5]]%) for each percentage point, or part thereof, that Base Dilution exceeds [[Percentage 4]]%.

^^**Late Reporting Fee:**Borrower will pay Crestmark a fee ("**Late Reporting Fee")** in an amount equal to One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) per business day for any day in which any report, financial statement or schedule required by this Agreement is delivered_late, unless Crestmark has specifically granted in writing an extension of time within which to deliver said report, financial statement or schedule.

^^**Lockbox Fee.**Each month the Borrower will pay all costs in connection with the Lockbox and the Cash Collateral Account, as determined by Crestmark from time to time. At present time, the Lockbox Fee is $250.00 per month.

^^**Documentation Fee.**In consideration of the extension of the Loan and the execution of this Agreement, Borrower will pay Crestmark a documentation fee of $[[USD Value 4: Number]] which fee is fully earned as of the date hereof and is non-refundable.

^^**Over Advance Fee.**In the event Borrowers Indebtedness exceeds the Advance Formula (the "Over Advance"), Crestmark may charge an Over Advance Fee of the greater of Two-Hundred Fifty Dollars and no/100 ($250.00) or [[Percentage 7: Number]]% per day on the amount of such Over Advance. Further such Over Advance Fee shall not constitute a waiver of any rights Crestmark may have as a result of an Over Advance.

^LOAN ACCOUNT:  
^^**Loan Account:**All Indebtedness under this Agreement will be charged to the Loan Account. Crestmark will provide Borrower, a monthly statement of the Loan Account, which will be deemed to be correct and accepted by and binding upon Borrower and Validity Guarantor, unless Crestmark receives a written statement of exception within ten (10) business days of mailing such statement.

^^**Payments to Loan Account:**Crestmark will debit the Loan Account the amount of each Money Advance when made or incurred. Three (3) business days after the occurrence of the last of the following (i) the collection of checks and other credit instruments (and subject to final collection) in the Cash Collateral Account and (ii) Borrower reporting the funds on its Borrowing Certificate, Crestmark will credit Borrower's Loan Account the net amount of cash received by Crestmark; **provided, however,** Crestmark will give Borrower immediate credit on such funds for calculating availability under the Advance Formula. If any check or other credit instrument for which Crestmark has granted Borrower credit is not paid, any credit so given will be reversed, and the Indebtedness restored. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Crestmark, in its sole discretion, exercised in a commercially reasonable manner, may decide not to immediately credit the Advance Formula if Crestmark determines that a particular check or credit instrument might not be immediately collectible from the maker or paying bank. Crestmark will have the right, in its sole discretion, exercised in a commercially reasonable manner, to extend the holding periods set forth above based upon concerns about the receipt of good funds.

Borrower acknowledges that the purpose of this Section 10 is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by Crestmark would not be commercially unreasonable in Crestmark's exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by Crestmark will not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this Section 10. Without limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this section will be construed to grant any rights to Borrower or to impose any duties on Crestmark that would not have been granted or imposed by this Agreement or by applicable law in the absence of this section.

Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed to make Crestmark an agent or trustee of Borrower or Validity Guarantor for any purpose whatsoever. Crestmark will not be responsible or liable for any shortage, discrepancy, damage, loss or destruction of any part of the Collateral wherever the same may be located and regardless of the cause thereof (except to the extent it is determined by final judicial decision that Crestmark's act or omission constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct).

Borrower and Validity Guarantor will remain liable for any deficiency, which Borrower and Validity Guarantor will pay to Crestmark immediately upon demand. Validity Guarantor's obligations in this paragraph are expressly limited pursuant to the Validity Guaranty executed by such Validity Guarantors.

^EXPENSES:  
Borrower will pay to Crestmark, on demand, any and all expenses, including actual attorneys' fees and collection expenses, incurred or paid by Crestmark in protecting or enforcing its rights under this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or pursuant to any other document or agreement relating to the Loan.

The expiration of each Renewal Term shall also be called the Maturity Date. All of Borrower's and Validity Guarantor's obligations, duties, promises, covenants, representations and warranties under this Agreement and Collateral Documents will continue and remain in full force and effect until the Indebtedness is irrevocably paid in full in cash, including all exit fees under the Note. Borrower understands that the entire Indebtedness is repayable on the demand of Crestmark, provided that if there is no event of Default at the time of demand for payment or thereafter, then notwithstanding anything herein or in the Note to the contrary, Borrower shall have ninety (90) days after demand for payment to find replacement financing or otherwise pay the Indebtedness in full and (i) Crestmark will continue its discretionary financing during said ninety (90) day period and (ii) Borrower shall not be in Default solely as a result of Borrower's non-payment of demanded sums during such ninety (90) day periods.

^^**Delay/Waiver:**No delay or failure of Crestmark in exercising any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder will affect such right, remedy, power or privilege, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. No delay or failure of Crestmark at any time to demand strict adherence to the terms of this Agreement will be deemed to constitute a course of conduct inconsistent with Crestmark's right at any time to demand strict adherence to the terms of this Agreement or the Collateral Documents.

Borrower agrees to pay and save Crestmark harmless against any liability for payment of any state documentary stamp taxes, intangible taxes or similar taxes (including interest or penalties, if any) which may now or hereafter be determined to be payable in respect of the execution, delivery or recording of this Agreement or any Collateral Documents or the making of any advance, whether originally thought to be due or not, and regardless of any mistake of fact or law on the part of Crestmark or the Borrower with respect to the applicability of such tax. The provisions of this section shall survive payment in full of the Borrower's obligations under this Agreement and the Collateral Documents and termination of this Agreement and/or the Collateral Documents.

^^**Limitation of Liability:**Neither Crestmark nor any of its affiliates, directors, officers, agents, attorneys or employees shall be liable to Borrower, Validity Guarantor or any of Borrower's affiliates for any action taken, or omitted to be taken, by it or them or any of them under this Agreement or any of the Collateral Documents or in connection herewith or therewith, except that no person shall be relieved of any liability imposed by law for gross negligence, recklessness or fraud.

^^**Survival and Continuation:**All representations, warranties, covenants, indemnifications, consents and agreements contained in this Agreement and/or any of the Collateral Documents will survive the execution of this Agreement, the Collateral Documents and any investigations by Crestmark and will be, and continue at all times while any Indebtedness is outstanding, to be true and accurate.

^^**Rules of Construction:**(a) No reference to "proceeds" in this Agreement authorizes any sale, transfer, or other disposition of the Collateral by Borrower; (b)"Includes" and "including" are not limiting; (c) "Or" is not exclusive; and (d) "all includes "any" and "any includes "all".

^^**Complete Agreement:**This Agreement incorporates and/or contains the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to its subject matter. None of the parties to this Agreement will be bound by anything not expressed in writing. This Agreement and the Collateral Documents may only be amended, modified or extended by a written agreement executed by Crestmark and Borrower.

^^**Severability:**If any provision of this Agreement is in conflict with any statute or rule of law or is otherwise unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be deemed null and void to the extent of the conflict or unenforceability and will be deemed severable. The offending provision will not invalidate any other provision of this Agreement.

^^**Reinstatement:**Borrower and Validity Guarantor further agrees that to the extent Borrower or Validity Guarantor makes a payment or payments to Crestmark, which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment or repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied will be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment had not been made.

^^**PAYABLE ON DEMAND:**THE LOAN IS PAYABLE ON DEMAND.

**NOTE:** As to the interests listed above, the listing thereof in this Loan and Security Agreement shall not, in any manner whatsoever, be deemed to be an acknowledgement by Crestmark as to the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability thereof.

\centered **PROMISSORY NOTE (LINE OF CREDIT)**

\centered **Principal Amount:** **$[[USD Value 1]]**      **[[Address 2: Address]]** 
**Due Date:** **ON DEMAND**      **Dated: [[Date 5]]**  

**FOR VALUE RECEIVED,** the undersigned, (the "**Borrower"**) promises, **ON DEMAND,** and if not sooner demanded, on the Maturity Date to pay to the order of Crestmark Bank, a Michigan banking corporation (hereinafter referred to as "**Crestmark"**), at its offices located at 850 East Long Lake Road, [[Address 3: Address]], or at such other place as Crestmark may designate in writing, the principal sum of up to TWO MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($[[USD Value 1]]), or so much thereof as may be outstanding from time to time under the Loan Agreement (as defined below), plus interest, fees and expenses as hereinafter provided, in lawful money of the United States of America. All payments under this Note must be in immediately available United States funds, without offset, deduction, setoff or counterclaim. Capitalized terms used in this Note, but not defined in this Note, have the meanings given to them in the Loan Agreement (as defined below).

The outstanding principal under this Note will bear interest on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed at an interest rate equal to THREE AND ONE-HALF PERCENT ([[Percentage 8: Number]]%) per annum in excess of the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate (the "Effective Rate"). The term "**Wall Street Journal Prime Rate"** means the interest rate reported daily in the Wall Street Journal, as the Prime Rate, as such rate varies from time to time. If the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate is decreased or increased, then the interest rate under this Note will decrease or increase by a like amount effective the day of each increase or decrease. If at any time Crestmark abandons the use of the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, or the paper ceases publishing it, then the new index will be the prime commercial rate established or selected by Crestmark or its successor or assign. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at no time will the Effective Rate be less than six and three quarters percent ([[Percentage 9: Number]]%) per annum.

Interest on the Indebtedness must be paid monthly, in arrears, for each calendar month and due on the first day of the following month for as long as any part of this Note remains outstanding. The first payment due hereunder shall be due and payable on [[Date 6: Date]]. Payments due and payable on a day on which Crestmark is not open for business are due on the next business day. Crestmark may, in its sole discretion, apply any payments it receives in the Cash Collateral Account and any other funds of the Borrower in its possession to any outstanding principal or other Indebtedness due Crestmark at any time, whether or not a Default then exists. Acceptance by Crestmark of any payment in an amount less than the amount then due will be deemed an acceptance on account only, and the failure to pay the entire amount then due is a Default.

Any payment made by mail will be deemed tendered and received only upon actual receipt by Crestmark. The Borrower expressly assumes all risk of loss resulting from non-delivery or delay in delivery of any payment transmitted by mail or in any other manner.

This Note is a note under which Money Advances, repayment and readvances may be made from time to time. Money Advances and readvances will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement.

If Crestmark has not demanded payment on this Note, and the Borrower elects to pay this Note, in full or in part, the Borrower may do so, but only upon the simultaneous payment of the following exit fee, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty: the sum of: (i) the monthly Maintenance Fee multiplied by the number of months remaining from the date of the prepayment until the applicable Maturity Date, plus (ii) any unpaid Commitment Fees due under the Loan Agreement, plus (iii) (a) two ([[Percentage 10: Number]]%) percent of the Maximum Amount if terminated during the first twelve months from the date of this Note, or (b)one ([[Percentage 11: Number]]%) of the Maximum Amount if terminated at any time thereafter. No partial prepayment will affect the Borrower's obligation to continue the regular payments due under this Note. In the event that payment of the indebtedness hereunder shall be accelerated after the occurrence of an event of default, the exit fee in effect as of the date of such acceleration shall be paid and such exit fee shall also be added to the outstanding balance of this Note in determining the debt for the purposes of any judgment of foreclosure of any loan documents give to secure the indebtedness hereunder.

Regardless of any provision contained in this Note, the Loan Agreement or any of the Collateral Documents or any other document executed in connection herewith, in no contingency or event whatsoever shall the aggregate of all amounts that are contracted for, charged or received by Crestmark pursuant to the terms of this Note, the Loan Agreement or any of the Collateral Documents and that are deemed interest under applicable law exceed the highest rate permissible under any applicable law. No agreements, conditions, provisions or stipulations contained in this Note, the Loan Agreement or any of the Collateral Documents or the exercise by Crestmark of the right to accelerate the payment or the maturity of all or any portion of the obligations owing to Crestmark (collectively the "Obligations"), or the exercise of any option whatsoever contained herein, in the Loan Agreement or in any of the Collateral Documents, or the prepayment by Borrower of any of the Obligations, or the occurrence of any contingency whatsoever, shall entitle Crestmark to charge or receive in any event, interest or any charges, amounts premiums or fees deemed interest by applicable law (such interest, charges, amounts, premiums and fees referred to herein collectively as "Interest") in excess of the maximum rate allowable under applicable law and in no event shall Borrower be obligated to pay Interest exceeding such maximum rate, and all agreements, conditions or stipulations, if any, which may in any event or contingency whatsoever operate to bind, obligate or compel Borrower to pay Interest exceeding the maximum rate allowable under applicable law shall be without binding force or effect, at law or in equity, to the extent only of the excess of Interest over such maximum rate. If any Interest is charged or received in excess of the maximum rate allowable under applicable law ("Excess"), Borrower acknowledges and stipulates that any such charge or receipt shall be the result of an accident and bona fide error, and such Excess, to the extent received, shall be applied first to reduce the principal Obligations and the balance, if any, returned to Borrower, it being the intent of the parties hereto not to enter into a usurious or otherwise illegal relationship. The right to accelerate the maturity of, or to make demand for repayment of any of the Obligations does not include the right to accelerate any interest that has not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, and Crestmark does not intend to collect any unearned interest in the event of any such acceleration. Borrower recognizes that, with fluctuations in the rates of interest set forth above and the maximum rate of interest allowable under applicable law, such an unintentional result could inadvertently occur. All monies paid to Crestmark hereunder or under the Loan Agreement or any of the Collateral Documents, whether at maturity or by prepayment, shall be subject to any rebate of unearned interest as and to the extent required by applicable law. By the execution of this Note, Borrower covenants that (i) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by Borrower of such Excess, and (ii) Borrower shall not seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable, against Crestmark, based in whole or in part upon contracting for, charging or receiving any Interest in excess of the maximum rate allowable under applicable law. For the purpose of determining whether or not any Excess has been contracted for, charged or received by Crestmark, all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received from Borrower in connection with this Note and any other agreement or document executed in connection herewith, the Loan Agreement or any of the Collateral Documents shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts throughout the full term of the Obligations. Borrower and Crestmark shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as Interest and (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof. The provisions of this paragraph shall be deemed to be incorporated into the Loan Agreement and all Collateral Documents (whether or not any provision of this paragraph is referred to therein). All such Loan Agreement and Collateral Documents and communications relating to any Interest owed by Borrower and all figures set forth therein shall, for the sole purpose of computing the extent of Obligations, be automatically recommitted by Borrower, and by any court considering the same, to give effect to the adjustments or credits required by this paragraph.

Upon the occurrence of a Default, which includes failure to pay the indebtedness under this Note on demand, Crestmark may declare all or part of this Note to be immediately due and payable. During any period of a Default, the interest rate on the outstanding Indebtedness will be the greater of ELEVEN AND THREE QUARTERS PERCENT ([[Percentage 12: Number]]%) per annum in excess of the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate or FIFTEEN PERCENT ([[Percentage 13: Number]]%) (the "**Default Rate"**). Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Default, Crestmark has all of the rights and remedies provided at law or equity or by agreement, including, those under the Loan Agreement. All remedies are cumulative and not exclusive.

No delay or failure by Crestmark in exercising any right, remedy, power or privilege (collectively, a "**right"**) will affect such right. No single or partial exercise of a right will preclude the exercise of any other right. No delay or failure of Crestmark at any time to demand strict adherence to the terms of this Note will be deemed to constitute a course of conduct inconsistent with Crestmark's right at any time to demand strict adherence to the terms of this Note.

The Borrower acknowledges that this Note matures upon issuance and that Crestmark, at any time, without notice and with or without reason, may demand that this Note be immediately paid in full or in part. The demand nature of this Note is not modified by reference to a Default in this Note or in the Loan Agreement or Collateral Documents. To the extent that there is reference to a Default, such reference is for the purpose of permitting Crestmark to accelerate this Note not on a demand basis and/or to receive interest at the Default Rate provided in this Note. It is expressly agreed that Crestmark may exercise its demand rights under this Note whether or not a Default has occurred. Crestmark, with or without reason and without notice, may from time to time make demand for partial payments under this Note and these demands will not preclude Crestmark from demanding at any time that this Note be immediately paid in full.

The Borrower hereby waives presentment for payment, demand, notice of non-payment, notice of protest and protest of this Note, and all other notices of any kind and diligence in collection or bringing suit. The liability of the Borrower is absolute and unconditional, without regard to the liability of any other party.

This Note is executed pursuant to and secured by a Loan and Security Agreement dated of even date herewith as the same may be amended, restated, modified or altered from time to time (the "**Loan Agreement"**) and the Collateral and Collateral Documents therein defined and described. Reference is made to the Loan Agreement and Collateral Documents for additional terms relating to this Note and the security given for this Note.

The Borrower grants Crestmark a security interest in Crestmark's own indebtedness or liability to the Borrower, if any, however evidenced, including a security interest in all of the Borrower's deposit accounts, instruments, negotiable documents and chattel paper which at any time are in the possession or control of Crestmark as further security for repayment of the Indebtedness of the Borrower.

The Borrower will reimburse Crestmark for all reasonable costs and expenses, including actual attorneys' fees, incurred by Crestmark in enforcing its rights under this Note and collecting the amounts due under this Note.
