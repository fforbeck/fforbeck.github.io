Interest on the Term Loans shall be payable monthly (such other interval as required under the applicable Note), in arrears, in accordance with the Notes, beginning on the first day of the first full calendar month after the Closing Date. 

^^Principal 

^^^Scheduled Repayments. There shall become due and payable, and Borrowers shall repay the Term Loans through scheduled payments on each date set forth on Schedule 2.5 attached hereto.

With respect to Term Loan A, on the fifteenth (15th) day of each month Lender shall debit the Blocked Account for the next due principal payment and accrued interest as set forth on Schedule 2.5, plus any Mandatory Prepayment which has not previously been paid. If the balance contained within such blocked account exceeds the amount of the next due principal and interest payments (inclusive of any then due Mandatory Prepayment), and no Event of Default shall have occurred, Borrower shall be free to transfer funds from the Trust Account to its Operating Account consistent with Exhibit B hereto. Principal payments from the Blocked Account in excess of the current installments shall be applied in inverse order of maturity to the remaining payments due under Term Loan A. If on a payment date the balance in the Blocked Account is less than the next due principal payment, the Borrowers shall remit the balance of such payment to the lender on such payment date and consistent with the Cash Management System the Borrowers shall replenish the Blocked Account so that at all times it has a minimum balance at least equal to the next succeeding scheduled installment of principal and interest on Term Loan A.

^^All Prepayments. Except as this Agreement may specifically provide otherwise, all prepayments of the Term Loans shall be applied by Lender to the Obligations in such order and manner as Lender may elect; *provided*, *however*, that prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.5(d), (e) and (f) shall be applied to payments due under the Term Loan A in inverse order of maturity until the Term Loans have been repaid in full.

^^Additional Interest Provisions: 

^^Interest on the Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days but charged for the actual number of days elapsed.

All such increases may be applied retroactively to the date of the occurrence of the Event of Default.

^^All contractual rates of interest chargeable on outstanding principal under the Loans shall continue to accrue and be paid even after Default, an Event of Default, maturity, acceleration, judgment, bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings of any kind or the happening of any event or occurrence similar or dissimilar. 

^^In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the aggregate of all amounts deemed interest hereunder and charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement exceed the highest rate permissible under any law which a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto. In the event that such court determines Lender has charged or received interest hereunder in excess of the highest applicable rate, Lender shall apply, in its sole discretion, and set off such excess interest received by Lender against other Obligations due or to become due and such rate shall automatically be reduced to the maximum rate permitted by such law. 

^^Fees and Charges: 

^^Borrower shall pay a fully earned non-refundable facility fee equal to one hundred fifty (150) basis points on the Maximum Term Loan Amount (the “Facility Fee”). 

^^Borrower shall unconditionally pay to Lender a late charge equal to five percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of any and all payments of principal or interest on the Loans that is not paid within fifteen (15) days of the due date. Such late charge shall be due and payable regardless of whether Lender has accelerated the Obligations. Borrower agrees that any late fee payable to Lender is a reasonable estimate of Lender’s damages and is not a penalty. 

^^Prepayments: Borrower may prepay the Loans in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, without penalty or premium (other than any breakage fees associated with terminating any Hedging Instruments or LIBOR contracts).

A notice to Borrower from Lender as to the amount of that reduction and showing the basis of the computation thereof submitted by Lender to Borrower shall be presumptive evidence of the matters set forth therein.

^^In addition to all other rights, options and remedies granted or available to Lender under this Agreement or the Loan Documents (each of which is also then exercisable by Lender), or otherwise available at law or in equity, upon or at any time after the acceleration of the Obligations following the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than the rights with respect to clause (iv) below which Lender may exercise at any time after an Event of Default and regardless of whether there is an acceleration), Lender may, in its discretion, exercise all rights under the UCC and any other applicable law or in equity, and under all Loan Documents permitted to be exercised after the occurrence of an Event of Default, including the following rights and remedies (which list is given by way of example and is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such rights and remedies): 

^^^the right to take possession of, send notices regarding and collect directly the Collateral, with or without judicial process (including without limitation the right to notify the United States postal authorities to redirect mail addressed to Borrowers to an address designated by Lender); or

^^^take additional reserves against the Borrowing Base; or

^^Each Borrower hereby agrees that a notice received by it at least seven (7) days before the time of any intended public sale or of the time after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral is to be made, shall be deemed to be reasonable notice of such sale or other disposition. If permitted by applicable law, any perishable inventory or Collateral which threatens to speedily decline in value or which is sold on a recognized market may be sold immediately by Lender without prior notice to either Borrower. Each Borrower covenants and agrees not to interfere with or impose any obstacle to Lender’s exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral, after the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder. Lender shall have no obligation to clean up or prepare the Collateral for sale. If Lender sells any of the Collateral upon credit, Borrowers will only be credited with payments actually made by the purchaser thereof, that are received by Lender. Lender may, in connection with any sale of the Collateral specifically disclaim any warranties of title or the like. 

^^Nature of Remedies: All rights and remedies granted Lender hereunder and under the Loan Documents, or otherwise available at law or in equity, shall be deemed concurrent and cumulative, and not alternative remedies, and Lender may proceed with any number of remedies at the same time until all Obligations are satisfied in full.

^^Set-Off: If any bank account of a Borrower with Lender or any participant is attached or otherwise liened or levied upon by any third party, Lender (and such participant) shall have and be deemed to have, without notice to such Borrower, the immediate right of set-off and may apply the funds or amount thus set-off against any of Borrowers’ Obligations hereunder. 

^^Limitation on Remedies 

^^Notwithstanding, anything else to the contrary contained herein, with respect to an Event of Default under Section 6.8 A, 6.8 B, or 6.8 C (b) hereof, Lender Agrees that it shall not, solely as it relates to Term Loan A and NSBF be entitled to exercise its rights under Section 8.3(a) or 8.3(b), provided that, Lender is expressly permitted to take additional reserves against the Borrowing Base, or to impose the default rate of interest. The foregoing limitation shall not apply if there shall have occurred any other Event of Default hereunder in which case Lender’s right of action shall not be impaired. Furthermore during such Event of Default nothing shall be deemed to limit Lender’s right to pursue any action against any Guarantor of the obligations including without limit CrystalTech. 

^^Notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.3(a) and (b), any exercise of the rights and remedies of Lender solely as it relates to Term Loan A and NSBF under Section 8.3(a) and (b) may be subject to the provisions of the Multi-Party Agreement.

If, after applying the foregoing, an inconsistency still exists, the provisions of this Agreement shall constitute an amendment thereto and shall control. 

^^Waiver: No omission or delay by Lender in exercising any right or power under this Agreement or any related agreements and documents will impair such right or power or be construed to be a waiver of any Default, or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein, and any single or partial exercise of any such right or power will not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and as to Borrowers no waiver will be valid unless in writing and signed by Lender and then only to the extent specified. 

^^Indemnity: 

^^Each Borrower releases and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lender and its respective officers, employees and agents, of and from any claims, demands, liabilities, obligations, judgments, injuries, losses, damages and costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees) resulting from (i) acts or conduct of either Borrower under, pursuant or related to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) either Borrower’s breach or violation of any representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, (iii) either Borrower’s failure to comply with any or all laws, statutes, ordinances, governmental rules, regulations or standards, whether federal, state or local, or court or administrative orders or decrees, (including without limitation Environmental Laws, etc.), and (iv) any claim by any other creditor of either Borrower against Lender arising out of any transaction whether hereunder or in any way related to the Loan Documents and all costs, expenses, fines, penalties or other damages resulting there from, unless resulting solely from acts or conduct of Lender constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence.

The omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection only if the indemnifying party is unable to defend such actions as a result of such failure to so notify. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. 

^^Time: Whenever Borrowers shall be required to make any payment, or perform any act, on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment may be made, or such act may be performed, on the next succeeding Business Day.

If any such claim is made on Lender by any broker, finder or agent or other person alleging that it is based on actions of a Borrower, a Guarantor or any affiliate, officer director or employee of either of them, Borrower hereby indemnifies, defends and saves such party harmless against such claim and further will defend, with counsel satisfactory to Lender, any action or actions to recover on such claim, at Borrowers’ own cost and expense, including such party’s reasonable counsel fees.

^^Joint and Several Obligations. 

^^Borrowers is defined collectively to include all Persons constituting the Borrowers; provided, however, that any references herein to “any Borrower”, “each Borrower” or similar references, shall be construed as a reference to each individual Person comprising the Borrowers. Each Person comprising Borrowers shall be jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of Borrowers under this Agreement regardless of which of the Borrowers actually receives the proceeds of the indebtedness governed hereby or the benefit of any other extensions of credit hereunder or the benefit of any other extension of credit under the Loan Documents, or the manner in which the Borrowers, the Lender account therefor in their respective books and records. In addition, each entity comprising Borrowers hereby acknowledges and agrees that all of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, conditions, agreements and other terms contained in this Agreement shall be applicable to and shall be binding upon and measured and enforceable individually against each Person comprising Borrowers as well as all such Persons when taken together. By way of illustration, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the terms of Section 8.1 of this Agreement are to be applied to each individual Person comprising the Borrowers (as well as to all such Persons taken as a whole), such that the occurrence of any of the events described in Section 8.1 of this Agreement as to any Person comprising the Borrowers shall constitute an Event of Default even if such event has not occurred as to any other Persons comprising the Borrowers or as to all such Persons taken as a whole (except as otherwise expressly provided therein). 

^^Each Borrower acknowledges that it will enjoy significant benefits from the business conducted by the other Borrowers because of, inter alia, their combined ability to bargain with other Persons including without limitation their ability to receive the credit extensions under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on favorable terms granted by this Agreement and other Loan Documents which would not have been available to an individual Borrower acting alone. Each Borrower has determined that it is in its best interest to procure the credit facilities contemplated hereunder, with the credit support of the other Borrowers as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 

^^Lender has advised the Borrowers that it is unwilling to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and make available the credit facilities extended hereby to any Borrower unless each Borrower agrees, among other things, to be jointly and severally liable for the due and proper payment of the Obligations of each other Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Borrower has determined that it is in its best interest and in pursuit of its purposes that it so induce the Lender to extend credit pursuant to this Agreement and the other documents executed in connection herewith (i) because of the desirability to each Borrower of the credit facilities hereunder and the interest rates and the modes of borrowing available hereunder, (ii) because each Borrower requires access to funds under this Agreement for the purposes herein set forth. Each Borrower, individually, expressly understands, agrees and acknowledges, that the credit facilities contemplated hereunder would not be made available on the terms herein in the absence of the collective credit of all of the Persons constituting the Borrowers, the joint and several liability of all such Persons, and the cross-collateralization of the collateral of all such Persons hereunder and under the Loan Documents. Accordingly, each Borrower individually acknowledges that the benefit to each of the 

Persons comprising the Borrowers as a whole constitutes reasonably equivalent value, regardless of the amount of the indebtedness actually borrowed by, advanced to, or the amount of credit provided to, or the amount of collateral provided by, any individual Borrower. 

^^To the extent that applicable law otherwise would render the full amount of the joint and several obligations of any Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents invalid or unenforceable, such Borrower’s obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be limited to the maximum amount which does not result in such invalidity or unenforceability; provided, however, that each Borrower’s obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be presumptively valid and enforceable to their fullest extent in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof, as if this Section were not a part of this Agreement. 

^^To the extent that any Borrower shall make a payment under this Section of all or any of the Obligations (other than credit facilities made to that Borrower for which it is primarily liable) (a “Joint Liability Payment”) which, taking into account all other Joint Liability Payments then previously or concurrently made by any other Borrower, exceeds the amount which such Borrower would otherwise have paid if each Borrower had paid the aggregate Obligations satisfied by such Joint Liability Payments in the same proportion that such Borrower’s Allocable Amount (as defined below) (as determined immediately prior to such Joint Liability Payments) bore to the aggregate Allocable Amounts of each of the Borrowers as determined immediately prior to the making of such Joint Liability Payments, then, following indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations and termination of the Commitments, such Borrower shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other Borrower for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Joint Liability Payments. As of any date of determination, the “Allocable Amount” of any Borrower shall be equal to the maximum amount of the claim which could then be recovered from such Borrower under this Section without rendering such claim voidable or avoidable under Section 548 of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or similar statute or common law. 

^^Lender is authorized, without notice or demand and without affecting the liability of any Borrower hereunder, to, at any time and from time to time, (i) renew, extend or otherwise increase the time for payment of the Obligations; (ii) with the written agreement of any Borrower accelerate or otherwise change the terms relating to the Obligations or otherwise modify, amend or change the terms of any promissory note or other agreement, document or instrument now or hereafter executed by any Borrower and delivered to Lender; (iii) accept partial payments of the Obligations; (iv) take and hold security or collateral for the payment of the Obligations or for the payment of any Guarantees of the Obligations and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security or collateral; (v) apply such security or collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Lender, in its sole discretion, may determine; and (vi) settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate the Obligations and any security or collateral therefor in any manner, without affecting or impairing the obligations of any Borrower. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, Lender shall have the exclusive right to determine the time and manner of application of any payments or credits, whether received from any Borrower or any other source, and such determination shall be binding on all Borrowers. All such payments and credits may be applied, reversed and reapplied, in whole or in part, to any of the Obligations as Lender shall determine in its sole discretion without affecting the validity or enforceability of the Obligations of any other Borrower. 

^^Each Borrower hereby agrees that, except as hereinafter provided, its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of (i) the absence of any attempt to collect the Obligations from any obligor or other action to enforce the same; (ii) the waiver or consent by Lender with respect to any provision of any instrument evidencing the Obligations, or any part thereof, or any other agreement heretofore, now or hereafter executed by a Borrower and delivered to Lender; (iii) failure by Lender to take any steps to perfect and maintain its security interest in, or to preserve its rights to, any security or collateral for the Obligations; (iv) the institution of any proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code, or any similar proceeding, by or against a Borrower or any Lender’s election in any such proceeding of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (v) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by a Borrower as debtor-in-possession, under Section 364 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (vi) the disallowance, under Section 502 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, of all or any portion of Lender’s claim(s) for repayment of any of the Obligations; or (vii) any other circumstance other than payment in full of the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety. 

^^Until all Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full, no payment made by or for the account of a Borrower including, without limitation, (i) a payment made by such Borrower on behalf of the liabilities of any other Borrower, or (ii) a payment made by any other person under any Guarantee, shall entitle such Borrower, by subrogation or otherwise, to any payment from any other Borrower or from or out of any other Borrower’s property and such Borrower shall not exercise any right or remedy against any other Borrower or any property of any other Borrower by reason of any performance of such Borrower of its joint and several obligations hereunder. 

^^Any notice given by one Borrower hereunder shall constitute and be deemed to be notice given by all Borrowers, jointly and severally. Notice given by Lender to any one Borrower hereunder or pursuant to any Loan Documents in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof shall constitute notice to each and every Borrower. The knowledge of one Borrower shall be imputed to all Borrowers and any consent by one Borrower shall constitute the consent of and shall bind all Borrowers. 

^^This Section is intended only to define the relative rights of Borrowers and nothing set forth in this Section is intended to or shall impair the obligations of Borrowers, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents. Nothing contained in this Section shall limit the liability of any Borrower to pay the credit facilities made directly or indirectly to that Borrower and accrued interest, Fees and expenses with respect thereto for which such Borrower shall be primarily liable. 

^^The parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of each Borrower to which such contribution and indemnification is owing. The rights of any indemnifying Borrower against the other Borrowers under this Section shall be exercisable upon the full and indefeasible payment of the Obligations and the termination of the credit facilities hereunder. 

^^Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, the provisions of this Section 9.24 are expressly limited such that NSBF shall not be deemed to jointly and severally liable for the portion of the Obligations accruing solely and exclusively under Term Loan B. The assets of NSBF are specifically not pledged as security for Term Loan B or for the benefit of CrystalTech. 

^^Guarantor Provisions. Solely with respect to Term Loan A:

^^^any defense based upon any legal disability or other defense of any other guarantor or other Person; iii. any defense based upon any lack of authority of the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on behalf of any other Borrower or any principal of any other Borrower or any defect in the formation of any other Borrower or any principal of any other Borrower; 

^^^any defense based upon the application by any other Borrower of the proceeds of the credit facilities for purposes other than the purposes represented by such other Borrower to Lender or intended or understood by Lender or such Borrower; 

^^^any defense based on such Borrower’s rights, under statute or otherwise, to require Lender to sue any other Borrower or otherwise to exhaust its rights and remedies against any other Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral before seeking to enforce its right to require such Borrower to satisfy the Obligations of any other Borrower; 

^^^any defense based on Lender’s failure at any time to require strict performance by any Borrower of any provision of the Loan Documents. Such Borrower agrees that no such failure shall waive, alter or diminish any right of Lender thereafter to demand strict compliance and performance therewith. Nothing contained herein shall prevent Lender from foreclosing on any Lien, or exercising any rights available to Lender thereunder, and the exercise of any such rights shall not constitute a legal or equitable discharge of such Borrower; 

^^^any defense arising from any act or omission of Lender which changes the scope of such Borrower’s risks hereunder; 

^^^any defense based upon Lender’s election of any remedy against such Borrower or any other Borrower or any of them; any defense based on the order in which Lender enforces its remedies;

^^^any defense based upon Lender’s failure to disclose to such Borrower any information concerning any other Borrower’s financial condition or any other circumstances bearing on any other Borrower’s ability to pay the Obligations;

^^^any defense based upon any borrowing or any grant of a security interest under Bankruptcy Code §364; xiv. any defense based on Lender’s failure to be diligent or to satisfy any other standard imposed on a secured party, in exercising rights with respect to collateral securing the Obligations; 

^^^except as otherwise expressly set forth herein: notice of acceptance hereof; notice of the existence, creation or acquisition of any Obligation; notice of any Event of Default; notice of the amount of the Obligations outstanding from time to time; notice of any other fact which might increase such Borrower’s risk; diligence; presentment; demand of payment; protest; filing of claims with a court in the event of any other Borrower’s receivership or bankruptcy and all other notices and demands to which such Borrower might otherwise be entitled (and agrees the same shall not have to be made on the other Borrower as a condition precedent to such Borrower’s obligations hereunder); 

^^^any defense based on errors and omissions by Lender in connection with its administration of the credit facilities or the Loans except to the extent constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct; 

^^^any defense based on application of fraudulent conveyance or transfer law or shareholder distribution law to any of the Obligations or the security therefor;

^^Each Borrower further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be impaired in any manner whatsoever by any bankruptcy, extensions, moratoria or other relief granted to any other Borrower pursuant to any statute presently in force or hereafter enacted. 

^^Each Borrower authorizes Lender to exercise, in its sole discretion, any right, remedy or combination thereof which may then be available to Lender, since it is such Borrower’s intent that the Obligations be absolute, independent and unconditional obligations of such Borrower under all circumstances. Notwithstanding any foreclosure of any Lien with respect to any or all of any property securing the Obligations, whether by the exercise of the power of sale contained therein, by an action for judicial foreclosure or by an acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, each Borrower shall remain bound under such Borrower’s Guarantee of the Obligations directly incurred by any other Borrower. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, NSBF is not jointly and severally liable for the obligation owing exclusively from any other Borrower. 

^^This Agreement is a primary and original obligation of each of the Borrowers and each of the Borrowers shall be liable for all existing and future Obligations of any other Borrower as fully as if such Obligations were directly incurred by such Borrower.
