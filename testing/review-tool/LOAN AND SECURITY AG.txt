**2.1.2** **Letters of Credit Sublimit**.  
^^Subject to the Overall Sublimit in Section 2.1.5 below,as part of the Revolving Line, Bank shall issue or have issued Letters of Credit for Borrower’s account, provided that, after giving effect to such Letters of Credit: (1) the total of the amount of all outstanding and undrawn Letters of Credit (including drawn but unreimbursed Letters of Credit), plus an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Reserves shall not exceed $[[USD Value 2: Number]]; and (2) the total of the amount of all outstanding and undrawn Letters of Credit (including drawn but unreimbursed Letters of Credit), plus an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Reserves, plus the FX Reserve, plus amounts used for Cash Management Services, plus the outstanding principal balance of any Advances (including any amounts used for Cash Management Services) shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Maximum Dollar Amount, or (ii) the Borrowing Base. The aggregate amounts utilized hereunder shall at all times reduce the amount otherwise available for Advances under the Revolving Line. If, on the Revolving Line Maturity Date, there are any outstanding Letters of Credit, then on such date Borrower shall provide to Bank cash collateral in an amount equal to [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the undrawn amount of all such Letters of Credit plus all interest, fees, and costs due or to become due in connection therewith (as estimated by Bank in its good faith business judgment), to secure all of the Obligations relating to said Letters of Credit. All Letters of Credit shall be in form and substance acceptable to Bank in its sole discretion and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Bank’s standard Application and Letter of Credit Agreement (the “**Letter of Credit Application**”). Borrower agrees to execute any further documentation in connection with the Letters of Credit as Bank may reasonably request. Borrower further agrees to be bound by the regulations and interpretations of the issuer of any Letters of Credit guarantied by Bank and opened for Borrower’s account or by Bank’s interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued by Bank for Borrower’s account, and Borrower understands and agrees that Bank shall not be liable for any error, negligence, or mistake, whether of omission or commission, in following Borrower’s instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto.

^^The obligation of Borrower to immediately reimburse Bank for drawings made under Letters of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Letters of Credit, and the Letter of Credit Application.

^^Borrower may request that Bank issue a Letter of Credit payable in a Foreign Currency. If a demand for payment is made under any such Letter of Credit, Bank shall treat such demand as an Advance to Borrower of the equivalent of the amount thereof (plus fees and charges in connection therewith such as wire, cable, SWIFT or similar charges) in Dollars at the then-prevailing rate of exchange in San Francisco, California, for sales of the Foreign Currency for transfer to the country issuing such Foreign Currency.

^^To guard against fluctuations in currency exchange rates, upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit payable in a Foreign Currency, Bank shall create a reserve (the “**Letter of Credit Reserve**”) under the Revolving Line in an amount equal to ten percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the face amount of such Letter of Credit. The amount of the Letter of Credit Reserve may be adjusted by Bank from time to time to account for fluctuations in the exchange rate. The availability of funds under the Revolving Line shall be reduced by the amount of such Letter of Credit Reserve for as long as such Letter of Credit remains outstanding.

**2.1.3** **Foreign Exchange Sublimit**.

The aggregate amount of FX Forward Contracts at any one time may not exceed ten (10) times the amount of the FX Reserve.

**2.1.4** **Cash Management Services Sublimit**. Subject to the Overall Sublimit in Section 2.1.5 below,Borrower may use up to $[[USD Value 2]] of the Revolving Line for Bank’s cash management services which may include merchant services, direct deposit of payroll, business credit card, and check cashing services identified in Bank’s various cash management services agreements (collectively, the “**Cash Management Services**”), provided that, after giving effect to such utilization, the total of the amount of all outstanding and undrawn Letters of Credit (including drawn but unreimbursed Letters of Credit), plus an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Reserves, plus the FX Reserve, plus amounts utilized for Cash Management Services, plus the outstanding principal balance of any Advances (including any amounts used for Cash Management Services) shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Maximum Dollar Amount, or (ii) the Borrowing Base. Any amounts used by Borrower for Cash Management Services will be treated as Advances under the Revolving Line, will accrue interest at the interest rate applicable to Advances, and will reduce the amount otherwise available for Credit Extensions thereunder.

Each Term Loan Advance is to be in an amount of at least $[[USD Value 4: Number]]; provided, that there shall be no minimum threshold amount with respect to the final Term Loan Advance requested by Borrower if the amount available under this Term Loan is less than $[[USD Value 5: Number]] A Term Loan Advance will only be made to finance xChange Point site installations for which (i) installation has been completed, (ii) the terms have been satisfied for Borrower to commence monthly billings regarding such site and (iii) Borrower has provided written evidence, satisfactory to Bank in its sole discretion, that the xChange Point site installation is complete and the terms to commence monthly billings in connection therewith have been satisfied (each a “Financed Site”).

The portion of a Term Loan Advance applicable to each Financed Site cannot exceed $[[USD Value 6: Number]] After a Term Loan Advance (or any portion thereof) has been repaid, no Term Loan Advance (or repaid portion thereof) may be reborrowed. As used herein, the term "Term Loan Draw Period" means the period of time beginning on the Effective Date and ending on [[Date 1: Date]] [the date that is ninety (90) days from the Effective Date].

^^**Interest-Only Period**. During the Term Loan Draw Period, interest only shall be payable on any and all Term Loan Advances outstanding from time to time.

^^**Repayment**. The aggregate principal amount of all Term Loan Advances outstanding at the end of the Term Loan Draw Period, shall be repaid in (A) thirty-three (33) equal installments of principal, plus (B) monthly payments of accrued interest (each a “Term Loan Payment”).

^^^**Involuntary**. If the Term Loan has become due and payable according to the terms hereof because of the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower shall pay to Bank on the date that the Term Loan has become due and payable according to the terms hereof, in addition to any other sums owing, a termination fee equal to the Term Loan Termination Fee, and such Term Loan Termination Fee shall bear interest until paid at a rate equal to the highest rate applicable to the Obligations.

^^**Final Payment**. On the earlier of (i) the Term Loan Maturity Date or (ii) the date Borrower prepays the Term Loan pursuant to subclause (d) above, Borrower shall pay to Bank an amount equal to the Final Payment. The Final Payment shall be in addition to (and not in lieu of) any principal, interest, fees, costs and other charges payable by Borrower to Bank.

^^**Overadvances**. If at any time or for any reason the total of all outstanding Advances and all other monetary Obligations exceeds the Availability Amount (an “**Overadvance**”), Borrower shall immediately pay the amount of the excess in cash to Bank, on demand.

^^**Payment of Interest on the Credit Extensions**.

^^**Interest Rate**.  
^^^**Advances**. Subject to Section 2.3(b), the principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Line shall accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to four percentage points ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) above the Prime Rate, which interest shall be payable monthly; **provided**, **however**, during a Streamline Period, subject to Section 2.3(b), the principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Line shall accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to two percentage points ([[Percentage 4: Number]]%) above the Prime Rate, which interest shall be payable monthly.

^^^**Term Loan**. Subject to Section 2.3(b), the principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan shall accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to five percentage points ([[Percentage 5: Number]]%) above the Prime Rate, which interest shall be payable monthly.

^^**Default Rate**. Immediately upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Obligations shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is three percentage points above the rate which is otherwise applicable to the Obligations (the “**Default Rate**”). Payment or acceptance of the increased interest rate provided in this Section 2.3(b) is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Bank.

^^**Adjustment to Interest Rate**. Changes to the interest rate of any Credit Extension based on changes to the Prime Rate shall be effective on the effective date of any change to the Prime Rate and to the extent of any such change.

Said float charge is not included in interest for purposes of computing Minimum Monthly Interest (if any) under this Agreement. The float charge for each month shall be payable on the last day of the month. Bank shall not, however, be required to credit Borrower's account for the amount of any item of payment which is unsatisfactory to Bank in its good faith business judgment, and Bank may charge Borrower's Designated Deposit Account for the amount of any item of payment which is returned to Bank unpaid.

Borrower is unaware of any claims or adjustments proposed for any of Borrower's prior tax years which could result in additional taxes in excess of an aggregate amount of $[[USD Value 10]] becoming due and payable by Borrower. Borrower has paid all amounts necessary to fund all present pension, profit sharing and deferred compensation plans in accordance with their terms, and Borrower has not withdrawn from participation in, and has not permitted partial or complete termination of, or permitted the occurrence of any other event with respect to, any such plan which could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of Borrower, including any liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or its successors or any other governmental agency. 

^^**Use of Proceeds**. Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Credit Extensions solely as working capital, and for other general business purposes and not for personal, family, household or agricultural purposes.

^^**Full Disclosure**. No written representation, warranty or other statement of Borrower in any certificate or written statement given to Bank, as of the date such representation, warranty, or other statement was made, taken together with all such written certificates and written statements given to Bank, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained in the certificates or statements not misleading (it being recognized by Bank that the projections and forecasts provided by Borrower in good faith and based upon reasonable assumptions are not viewed as facts and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such projections and forecasts may differ from the projected or forecasted results).

** **AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS****  
Borrower shall do all of the following:

^^**Government Compliance**. Maintain its and all its Subsidiaries’ legal existence and good standing in their respective jurisdictions of formation and maintain qualification in each jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify would reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change. Borrower shall comply, and have each Subsidiary comply, with all laws, ordinances and regulations to which it is subject, noncompliance with which could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.

^^**Financial Statements, Reports, Certificates**.

(a)Borrower shall provide Bank with the following:

^^^[omitted];

^^^within thirty (30) days prior to the end of each fiscal year of Borrower, (A) annual operating budgets (including income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, by month) for the upcoming fiscal year of Borrower, and (B) annual financial projections for the following fiscal year (on a quarterly basis) as approved by Borrower’s board of directors, together with any related business forecasts used in the preparation of such annual financial projections; and

^^^as soon as available, and in any event within 120 days following the end of Borrower's fiscal year, annual financial statements certified by, and with an opinion without a “going concern” qualification of, independent certified public accountants acceptable to Bank in its good faith business judgment.

^^At all times that Borrower is subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or other similar requirements of the Toronto Stock Exchange), within five (5) days after filing, all reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (or other similar reports filed with the Canadian equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or a link thereto on Borrower’s or another website on the Internet.

^^Prompt written notice of (i) any material change in the composition of the intellectual property, (ii) the registration of any copyright, including any subsequent ownership right of Borrower in or to any copyright, patent or trademark not shown in the IP Security Agreement, or (iii) Borrower’s knowledge of an event that materially adversely affects the value of the intellectual property.

^^Accounts Receivable.  
^^**Schedules and Documents Relating to Accounts**. Borrower shall deliver to Bank transaction reports and schedules of collections, as provided in Section 6.2, on Bank’s standard forms; provided, however, that Borrower’s failure to execute and deliver the same shall not affect or limit Bank’s Lien and other rights in all of Borrower’s Accounts, nor shall Bank’s failure to advance or lend against a specific Account affect or limit Bank’s Lien and other rights therein. If requested by Bank, Borrower shall furnish Bank with copies (or, at Bank’s request, originals) of all contracts, orders, invoices, and other similar documents, and all shipping instructions, delivery receipts, bills of lading, and other evidence of delivery, for any goods the sale or disposition of which gave rise to such Accounts. In addition, Borrower shall deliver to Bank, on its request, the originals of all instruments, chattel paper, security agreements, guarantees and other documents and property evidencing or securing any Accounts, in the same form as received, with all necessary endorsements, and copies of all credit memos.

^^**Disputes**. Borrower shall promptly notify Bank of all disputes or claims relating to Accounts. Borrower may forgive (completely or partially), compromise, or settle any Account for less than payment in full, or agree to do any of the foregoing so long as (i) Borrower does so in good faith, in a commercially reasonable manner, in the ordinary course of business, in arm’s-length transactions, and reports the same to Bank in the regular reports provided to Bank; and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and (iii) after taking into account all such discounts, settlements and forgiveness, the total outstanding Advances will not exceed the lesser of the Revolving Line or the Borrowing Base.

^^**Collection of Accounts**. Borrower shall have the right to collect all Accounts, unless and until a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Whether or not an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall hold all payments on, and proceeds of, Accounts in trust for Bank, and Borrower shall immediately deliver all such payments and proceeds to Bank in their original form, duly endorsed, to be applied to the Obligations pursuant to the terms of Section 9.4 hereof. Bank may, in its good faith business judgment, require that all proceeds of Accounts be deposited by Borrower into a lockbox account, or such other “blocked account” as Bank may specify, pursuant to a blocked account agreement in such form as Bank may specify in its good faith business judgment.

^^**Returns**. Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, if any Account Debtor returns any Inventory to Borrower, Borrower shall promptly (i) determine the reason for such return, (ii) issue a credit memorandum to the Account Debtor in the appropriate amount, and (iii) provide a copy of such credit memorandum to Bank, upon request from Bank. In the event any attempted return occurs after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Borrower shall hold the returned Inventory in trust for Bank, and immediately notify Bank of the return of the Inventory.

^^**Verification**. Bank may, from time to time, verify directly with the respective Account Debtors the validity, amount and other matters relating to the Accounts, either in the name of Borrower or Bank or such other name as Bank may choose.

^^**No Liability**. Bank shall not be responsible or liable for any shortage or discrepancy in, damage to, or loss or destruction of, any goods, the sale or other disposition of which gives rise to an Account, or for any error, act, omission, or delay of any kind occurring in the settlement, failure to settle, collection or failure to collect any Account, or for settling any Account in good faith for less than the full amount thereof, nor shall Bank be deemed to be responsible for any of Borrower's obligations under any contract or agreement giving rise to an Account. Nothing herein shall, however, relieve Bank from liability for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

^^**Remittance of Proceeds**. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3(c), deliver, in kind, all proceeds arising from the disposition of any Collateral to Bank in the original form in which received by Borrower not later than five (5) Business Days after receipt by Borrower, to be applied to the Obligations pursuant to the terms of Section 9.4 hereof; provided that, if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall not be obligated to remit to Bank the proceeds of the sale of Collateral not constituting Accounts disposed of by Borrower in good faith in an arm’s length transaction for an aggregate purchase price of $[[USD Value 11]] or less (for all such transactions in any fiscal year). Borrower agrees that it will not commingle proceeds of Collateral with any of Borrower’s other funds or property, but will hold such proceeds separate and apart from such other funds and property and in an express trust for Bank. Nothing in this Section limits the restrictions on disposition of Collateral set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

^^**Taxes; Pensions**. Timely file all required tax returns and reports and timely pay all foreign, federal, state and local taxes, assessments, deposits and contributions owed by Borrower except for deferred payment of any taxes contested pursuant to the terms of Section 5.9 hereof, and pay all amounts necessary to fund all present pension, profit sharing and deferred compensation plans in accordance with their terms.

^^**Access to Collateral; Books and Records**. At reasonable times, on three (3) Business Day’s notice (provided no notice is required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), Bank, or its agents, shall have the right to inspect the Collateral and the right to audit and copy Borrower’s Books. Borrower and Bank hereby acknowledge that the first such audit will be conducted within ninety (90) days after the Effective Date and prior to (with results satisfactory to Bank in its good faith business judgment) the initial Revolving Line Advance, and thereafter, such audits will be performed no more frequently than semi-annually (annually if a Streamline Period is in effect), but nothing herein restricts Bank’s right to conduct such audits more frequently if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. The foregoing inspections and audits shall be at Borrower’s expense, and the charge therefor shall be $[[USD Value 20: Number]] per person per day (or such higher amount as shall represent Bank’s then-current standard charge for the same), plus reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses. In the event Borrower and Bank schedule an audit more than ten (10) days in advance, and Borrower cancels or seeks to reschedules the audit with less than ten (10) days written notice to Bank, then (without limiting any of Bank’s rights or remedies), Borrower shall pay Bank a fee of $[[USD Value 12: Number]] plus any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Bank to compensate Bank for the anticipated costs and expenses of the cancellation or rescheduling.

^^**Insurance**. Keep its business and the Collateral insured for risks and in amounts standard for companies in Borrower’s industry and location and as Bank may reasonably request. Insurance policies shall be in a form, with companies, and in amounts that are satisfactory to Bank. All property policies shall have a lender’s loss payable endorsement showing Bank as an additional lender loss payee and waive subrogation against Bank, and all liability policies shall show, or have endorsements showing, Bank as an additional insured. All policies (or the loss payable and additional insured endorsements) shall provide that the insurer must give Bank at least twenty (20) days notice before canceling, amending, or declining to renew its policy. At Bank’s request, Borrower shall deliver certified copies of policies and evidence of all premium payments. Proceeds payable under any policy shall, at Bank’s option, be payable to Bank on account of the Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall have the option of applying the proceeds of any casualty policy up to $[[USD Value 13: Number]] in the aggregate, toward the replacement or repair of destroyed or damaged property; provided that any such replaced or repaired property (i) shall be of equal or like value as the replaced or repaired Collateral and (ii) shall be deemed Collateral in which Bank has been granted a first priority security interest, and (b) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all proceeds payable under such casualty policy shall, at the option of Bank, be payable to Bank on account of the Obligations. If Borrower fails to obtain insurance as required under this Section 6.7 or to pay any amount or furnish any required proof of payment to third persons and Bank, Bank may make all or part of such payment or obtain such insurance policies required in this Section 6.7, and take any action under the policies Bank deems prudent. The insurance maintained by Borrower on the Effective Date and approved by Bank shall be deemed to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.7 subject to Borrower’s satisfaction of the condition subsequent set forth in Section 3.1A(d) hereof.

^^**Operating Accounts**.  
^^Maintain all of its and its Subsidiaries’ primary depository and operating accounts and securities accounts with Bank and Bank’s affiliateswhich accounts shall represent at least [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of the dollar value of Borrower’s and such Subsidiaries accounts at all financial institutions.Such [[Percentage 6]]% amount shall include the up to $[[USD Value 14: Number]] transferred by Borrower to DairyGen (and to be held at Pacific Mercantile Bank) to cash secure the credit facility of DairyGen to Pacific Mercantile Bank.

^^Provide Bank five (5) days prior written notice before establishing any Collateral Account at or with any bank or financial institution other than Bank or Bank’s Affiliates. In addition, for each Collateral Account that Borrower at any time maintains, Borrower shall cause the applicable bank or financial institution (other than Bank) at or with which any Collateral Account is maintained to execute and deliver a Control Agreement or other appropriate instrument with respect to such Collateral Account to perfect Bank’s Lien in such Collateral Account in accordance with the terms hereunder**;** provided that within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, Borrower shall cause Pacific Mercantile Bank to execute such Control Agreement with respect to any Collateral Account maintained by Borrower at Pacific Mercantile Bank. The provisions of the previous sentence shall not apply to deposit accounts exclusively used for payroll, payroll taxes and other employee wage and benefit payments to or for the benefit of Borrower’s employees and identified to Bank by Borrower as such.

^^**Financial Covenants**.  
As of the last day of each month, Borrower shall maintain on a consolidated basis:

^^**Tangible Net Worth**.

Increases in the Minimum Tangible Net Worth based on consideration received for equity securities and subordinated debt of the Borrower shall be effective as of the end of the month in which such consideration is received, and shall continue effective thereafter. Increases in the Minimum Tangible Net Worth based on net income shall be effective on the last day of the fiscal quarter in which said net income is realized, and shall continue effective thereafter. In no event shall the Minimum Tangible Net Worth be decreased.

^^**Intellectual Property Rights**. Borrower shall: (a) protect, defend and maintain the validity and enforceability of its intellectual property material to Borrower’s business; (b) promptly advise Bank in writing of material infringements of its intellectual property material to Borrower’s business; and (c) not allow any intellectual property material to Borrower’s business to be abandoned, forfeited or dedicated to the public without Bank’s written consent. If Borrower (i) obtains any patent, registered trademark or servicemark, registered copyright, registered mask work, or any pending application for any of the foregoing, whether as owner, licensee or otherwise, or (ii) applies for any patent or the registration of any trademark or servicemark, then Borrower shall promptly provide written notice thereof to Bank and shall execute such intellectual property security agreements and other documents and take such other actions as Bank shall request in its good faith business judgment to perfect and maintain a first priority perfected security interest in favor of Bank in such property. If Borrower decides to register any copyrights or mask works in the United States Copyright Office, Borrower shall: (x) provide Bank with at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice of Borrower’s intent to register such copyrights or mask works together with a copy of the application it intends to file with the United States Copyright Office (excluding exhibits thereto); (y) execute an intellectual property security agreement and such other documents and take such other actions as Bank may request in its good faith business judgment to perfect and maintain a first priority perfected security interest in favor of Bank in the copyrights or mask works intended to be registered with the United States Copyright Office; and (z) record such intellectual property security agreement with the United States Copyright Office contemporaneously with filing the copyright or mask work application(s) with the United States Copyright Office. Borrower shall promptly provide to Bank copies of all applications that it files for patents or for the registration of trademarks, servicemarks, copyrights or mask works, together with evidence of the recording of the intellectual property security agreement necessary for Bank to perfect and maintain a first priority perfected security interest in such property.

^^**Litigation Cooperation**. From the date hereof and continuing through the termination of this Agreement, make available to Bank, without expense to Bank, Borrower and its officers, employees and agents and Borrower's books and records, to the extent that Bank may deem them reasonably necessary to prosecute or defend any third-party suit or proceeding instituted by or against Bank with respect to any Collateral or relating to Borrower.

^^Borrower fails or neglects to perform any obligation in Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 6.8, or 6.9 (**provided**, **however**, a default under Section 6.9 in and of itself will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Term Loan, and Bank will not exercise its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to the Term Loan if the only default hereunder is a default under Section 6.9), or violates any covenant in Section 7; or

^^Borrower fails or neglects to perform, keep, or observe any other term, provision, condition, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any Loan Documents, and as to any default (other than those specified in this Section 8) under such other term, provision, condition, covenant or agreement that can be cured, has failed to cure the default within ten (10) days after the occurrence thereof; provided, however, that if the default cannot by its nature be cured within the ten (10) day period or cannot after diligent attempts by Borrower be cured within such ten (10) day period, and such default is likely to be cured within a reasonable time, then Borrower shall have an additional period (which shall not in any case exceed thirty (30) days) to attempt to cure such default, and within such reasonable time period the failure to cure the default shall not be deemed an Event of Default (but no Credit Extensions shall be made during such cure period). Grace periods provided under this section shall not apply, among other things, to financial covenants or any other covenants set forth in subsection (a) above;

Bank is hereby granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license or other right to use, without charge, Borrower’s labels, patents, copyrights, mask works, rights of use of any name, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and advertising matter, or any similar property as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and, in connection with Bank’s exercise of its rights under this Section, Borrower’s rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements inure to Bank’s benefit;

^^demand and receive possession of Borrower’s Books; and

^^exercise all rights and remedies available to Bank under the Loan Documents or at law or equity, including all remedies provided under the Code (including disposal of the Collateral pursuant to the terms thereof).

^^**Power of Attorney**. Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Bank as its lawful attorney-in-fact, exercisable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to: (a) endorse Borrower’s name on any checks or other forms of payment or security; (b) sign Borrower’s name on any invoice or bill of lading for any Account or drafts against Account Debtors; (c) settle and adjust disputes and claims about the Accounts directly with Account Debtors, for amounts and on terms Bank determines reasonable; (d) make, settle, and adjust all claims under Borrower’s insurance policies; (e) pay, contest or settle any Lien, charge, encumbrance, security interest, and adverse claim in or to the Collateral, or any judgment based thereon, or otherwise take any action to terminate or discharge the same; and (f) transfer the Collateral into the name of Bank or a third party as the Code permits. Borrower hereby appoints Bank as its lawful attorney-in-fact to sign Borrower’s name on any documents necessary to perfect or continue the perfection of Bank’s security interest in the Collateral regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred until all Obligations have been satisfied in full and Bank is under no further obligation to make Credit Extensions hereunder. Bank’s foregoing appointment as Borrower’s attorney in fact, and all of Bank’s rights and powers, coupled with an interest, are irrevocable until all Obligations have been fully repaid and performed and Bank’s obligation to provide Credit Extensions terminates.

^^**Protective Payments**. If Borrower fails to obtain the insurance called for by Section 6.7 or fails to pay any premium thereon or fails to pay any other amount which Borrower is obligated to pay under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Bank may obtain such insurance or make such payment, and all amounts so paid by Bank are Bank Expenses and immediately due and payable, bearing interest at the then highest applicable rate, and secured by the Collateral. Bank will make reasonable efforts to provide Borrower with notice of Bank obtaining such insurance at the time it is obtained or within a reasonable time thereafter. No payments by Bank are deemed an agreement to make similar payments in the future or Bank’s waiver of any Event of Default.

^^**Application of Payments and Proceeds.** Borrower shall have no right to specify the order or the accounts to which Bank shall allocate or apply any payments required to be made by Borrower to Bank or otherwise received by Bank under this Agreement when any such allocation or application is not specified elsewhere in this Agreement. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Bank may apply any funds in its possession, whether from Borrower account balances, payments, proceeds realized as the result of any collection of Accounts or other disposition of the Collateral, or otherwise, to the Obligations in such order as Bank shall determine in its sole discretion. Any surplus shall be paid to Borrower by credit to the Designated Deposit Account or to other Persons legally entitled thereto; Borrower shall remain liable to Bank for any deficiency. If Bank, in its good faith business judgment, directly or indirectly enters into a deferred payment or other credit transaction with any purchaser at any sale of Collateral, Bank shall have the option, exercisable at any time, of either reducing the Obligations by the principal amount of the purchase price or deferring the reduction of the Obligations until the actual receipt by Bank of cash therefor.. 

^^**Bank’s Liability for Collateral**. So long as Bank complies with reasonable banking practices regarding the safekeeping of the Collateral in the possession or under the control of Bank, Bank shall not be liable or responsible for: (a) the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b) any loss or damage to the Collateral; (c) any diminution in the value of the Collateral; or (d) any act or default of any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, or other Person. Borrower bears all risk of loss, damage or destruction of the Collateral.

^^**No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative**. Bank’s failure, at any time or times, to require strict performance by Borrower of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not waive, affect, or diminish any right of Bank thereafter to demand strict performance and compliance herewith or therewith. No waiver hereunder shall be effective unless signed by Bank and then is only effective for the specific instance and purpose for which it is given. Bank’s rights and remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative. Bank has all rights and remedies provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. Bank’s exercise of one right or remedy is not an election, and Bank’s waiver of any Event of Default is not a continuing waiver. Bank’s delay in exercising any remedy is not a waiver, election, or acquiescence.

^^**Demand Waiver**. Borrower waives demand, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment, notice of any default, nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of accounts, documents, instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees held by Bank on which Borrower is liable.

California law governs the Loan Documents without regard to principles of conflicts of law. Borrower and Bank each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in Santa Clara County, California; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to operate to preclude Bank from bringing suit or taking other legal action in any other jurisdiction to realize on the Collateral or any other security for the Obligations, or to enforce a judgment or other court order in favor of Bank.

Borrower hereby waives personal service of the summons, complaints, and other process issued in such action or suit and agrees that service of such summons, complaints, and other process may be made by registered or certified mail addressed to Borrower at the address set forth in Section 10 of this Agreement and that service so made shall be deemed completed upon the earlier to occur of Borrower’s actual receipt thereof or three (3) days after deposit in the U.S. mails, proper postage prepaid.

The private judge shall have the power, among others, to grant provisional relief, including without limitation, entering temporary restraining orders, issuing preliminary and permanent injunctions and appointing receivers. All such proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed. If during the course of any dispute, a party desires to seek provisional relief, but a judge has not been appointed at that point pursuant to the judicial reference procedures, then such party may apply to the Santa Clara County, California Superior Court for such relief. The proceeding before the private judge shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The parties shall be entitled to discovery which shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of discovery applicable to judicial proceedings. The private judge shall oversee discovery and may enforce all discovery rules and order applicable to judicial proceedings in the same manner as a trial court judge. The parties agree that the selected or appointed private judge shall have the power to decide all issues in the action or proceeding, whether of fact or of law, and shall report a statement of decision thereon pursuant to the California Code of Civil Procedure § 644(a). Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of any party at any time to exercise self-help remedies, foreclose against collateral, or obtain provisional remedies.
