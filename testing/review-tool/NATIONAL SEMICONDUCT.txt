Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.

^*INTEREST*. [[Company]], a Delaware corporation (the “***Company***”), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at [[Percentage 1]]% per annum from the date hereof until maturity. The Company will pay interest semi-annually on [[Date 4]] and [[Date 5]] of each year, or if any such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an “***Interest Payment Date***”). Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of issuance; *provided* that if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest, and if this Note is authenticated between a record date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest will accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date; *provided, further*, that the first Interest Payment Date will be [[Date 8: Date]]. The Company will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal at the rate equal to the then applicable interest rate on the Notes to the extent lawful; it will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

^*METHOD OF PAYMENT*. The Company will pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the [[Date 6]] or [[Date 7]] next preceding the Interest Payment Date, even if such Notes are canceled after such record date and on or before such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in Section 2.13 of the Base Indenture with respect to defaulted interest. Principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the Paying Agent and Registrar within the City and State of New York or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders of Notes; *provided* that all payments of principal, premium and interest with respect to Notes the Holders of which have given wire transfer instructions to the Trustee will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders thereof. Such payment will be in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

^*PAYING AGENT AND REGISTRAR*. Initially, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture, will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act in any such capacity.

^*NOTICE OF REDEMPTION*. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes in denominations larger than $[[USD Value 2]] may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $[[USD Value 4: Number]] unless all of the Notes held by a Holder are to be redeemed. On and after the redemption date interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

Without the consent of any Holder of a Note, the Supplemental Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented (i) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; (ii) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes; (iii) to provide for the assumption of the Company’s obligations to Holders of the Notes in case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; (iv) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Supplemental Indenture of any such Holder; (v) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Supplemental Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; (vi) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the Supplemental Indenture; or (vii) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee.

^*DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES.* An “EVENT OF DEFAULT” occurs if: (i) there is a default for a period of 90 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes; (ii) there is a default in the payment when due of principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes; (iii) the Company fails for 90 days after notice to the Company to comply with any covenant or warranty of the Company in the Indenture; or (iv) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency occur with respect to the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, or the principal of, the Notes. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

^*TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH COMPANY*. The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.

^*NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS*. A director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder, of the Company, as such, will not have any liability for any obligations of the Company 

\centered A-4

under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes.
