This Special Warranty Deed is made and accepted expressly subject to the matters set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto and made a part hereof for all purposes. 

This Special Warranty Deed, and the conveyance made hereby, is being executed, delivered and accepted in lieu of foreclosure of the liens on the Property securing a certain loan (“**Loan**”), and as an absolute conveyance to Grantee of the Property, including specifically but without limitation, any equity or rights of redemption of Grantor or any other person liable thereon or thereto.
