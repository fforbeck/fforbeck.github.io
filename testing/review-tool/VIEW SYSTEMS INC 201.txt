\centered **PERFORMANCE UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES**

^^Grant of Performance Units/Shares. Performance Units and Performance Shares may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time, as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion. The Administrator will have complete discretion in determining the number of Performance Units and Performance Shares granted to each Participant. 

^^Value of Performance Units/Shares. Each Performance Unit will have an initial value that is established by the Administrator on or before the date of grant. Each Performance Share will have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. 

^^Performance Objectives and Other Terms. The Administrator will set performance objectives or other vesting provisions (including, without limitation, continued status as a Service Provider) in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance Units/Shares that will be paid out to the Service Providers. The time period during which the performance objectives or other vesting provisions must be met will be called the “Performance Period.” Each Award of Performance Units/Shares will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. The Administrator may set performance objectives based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, or individual goals, applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion. 

^^Earning of Performance Units/Shares. After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives or other vesting provisions have been achieved.

\centered SECTION 10

\centered **TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS**

^^General. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award will contain such additio nal terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate. 

^^Award Transfer Program. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan, the Administrator shall have all discretion and authority to determine and implement the terms and conditions of any Award Transfer Program instituted pursuant to this Section 10 and shall have the authority to amend the terms of any Award participating, or otherwise eligible to participate in, the Award Transfer Program, including (but not limited to) the authority to (i) amend (including to extend) the expiration date, post-termination exercise period and/or forfeiture conditions of any such Award, (ii) amend or remove any provisions of the Award relating to the Award holder’s continued service to the Company, (iii) amend the permissible payment methods with respect t o the exercise or purchase of any such Award, (iv) amend the adjustments to be implemented in the event of changes in the capitalization and other similar events with respect to such Award, and (v) make such other changes to the terms of such Award as the Administrator deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion. 

\centered SECTION 11

\centered **ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION; DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION; MERGER OR CHANGE IN CONTROL**

^^Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock which has been authorized for issuance under the Plan, including Shares as to which no Award have yet b een granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Award and including the annual increase provided for in Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by each outstanding Award and/or the price per share of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Award, shall be proportionately adjusted for any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. Such adjustment shall be made by the Administrator, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Notwithstanding the precedi ng, the number of Shares subject to any Award always shall be a whole number. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Award. 

^^Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. 

^^Merger or Change in Control. In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Award will be treated as the Administrator determines, including, without limitation, that each Award be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. The Administrator will not be required to treat all Awards similarly in the transaction. 

In the event that the successor corporation does not assume or substitute for the Award, the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock will lapse, and all performance goals or other ve sting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent ([[Percentage 3]]%) of target levels and 

\centered A-13

all other terms and conditions met. In addition, if an Option is not assumed or substituted in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, and the Option will terminate upon the expiration of such period. 

For the purposes of this subsection, an Award will be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or upon the payout of a Performance Unit or Performance Share, for each Share subject to such Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control. 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.3 to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant’s consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation’s post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption. 

^^Outside Director Awards. With respect to Awards granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if on the date of or following such assumption or substitution the Participant’s status as a Director or a director of the successo r corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant (unless such resignation is at the request of the acquirer), then the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise Options as to all of the Shares underlying such Award, including those Shares which would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock will lapse, and, with respect to Performance Units and Performance Shares, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent ([[Percentage 3]]%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met. 

\centered SECTION 12

\centered **TAX WITHHOLDING**

^^Withhol ding Requirements. Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company will have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes (including the Participant’s FICA obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof). 

^^Withholding Arrangements. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part (without limitation), by (a) paying cash, (b) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares, or (c) delivering to the Company Shares then owned by the Participant having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld. The amount of the withholding requirement shall be deemed to include any amount that the Board agrees may be withheld at the time any such election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered shall be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld.

The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if (x) the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Stock Award has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (y) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws. The Company may, upon advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the Common Stock.

^Notice of Exercise. The Participant, or the person or persons having the right to exercise the Option upon the death or Disability of the Participant, shall exercise the Option by delivering to the Company written notice specifying the number of Option Shares which the Participant elects to purchase, together with either (i) cash, (ii) cancellation of any indebtedness owed by the Company to the Participant, or (iii) any combination of the above, the sum of which equals the total price to be paid upon the exercise of the Option, and the common stock purchased shall thereupon be promptly delivered. The Participant will not be deemed to be a holder of a ny shares, pursuant to the exercise of the Option, until the date of issuance to the Participant of a stock certificate, for such shares, and until the shares are paid in full.

This Option and this Option Agreement are subject to and shall be construed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan, as now or hereinafter in effect. Any terms which are used in this Option Agreement without being defined and which are defined in the Plan shall have the meaning specified in the Plan.

^Date of Grant. The date of the grant of the Option is the date set forth above, the date of the action by the Boar d of Directors or its Committee which administers the Plan (the “Board”) in granting the same.

^Exercise of Option. 

^^Vesting. 25 percent ([[Percentage 5]]%) of the Option Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares) shall vest on the first anniversary of the Grant Date; and the remaining Option Shares shall vest ratably (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares), as of the last day of each calendar month, over the next 36-month period. 

^^After an Option is granted, the Board may accelerate the exercisability of the Option. If the Board provides that any Option is exercisable only in installments, the Board may at any time waive such installment exercise provisions, in whole or in part, based on such fa ctors as the Board may determine.

^^In all events, vesting under this Section shall cease upon termination of Participant’s service with the Company for any reason. Termination of Service as defined in the Plan means (a) in the case of an Employee, a cessation of the employee-employer relationship between an employee and the Company for any reason, and (b) in the case of a Director or Consultant, a cessation of service as a member of the Board for any reason; but excluding in all cases any such cessation where there is a simultaneous reengagement of individual by the Company.

\centered A-30

In the event the Participant fails to exercise his right to acquire vested Option Shares within the foregoing timeframe, all rights of the Participant with respect to such Option Shares shall terminate.

The Participant will not be deemed to be a holder of any shares, pursuant to the exercise of the Option, until the date of issuance to the Participant of a stock certificate, for such shares, and until the shares are paid in full.

^Limited Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred, gifted, bequeathed, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, voluntarily or involuntarily, except that the Board may permit a transfer, upon the Participant’s death, to beneficiaries designated by the Participant as provided in Sections 13.14 and 6.8.3 of the Plan. The Board may also permit a limited transfer due to disability, or retirement as provide d in Section 6.8.2 of the Plan.

The Com pany and Participant agree as follows: 

^Grant of Option. Pursuant to you Option Grant Notice, Participant is hereby granted a Non-Discretionary Stock Option (“the Option”) pursuant to the VIEW SYSTEMS, INC. 2010 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (the “Plan”) to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company indicated on your Grant Notice. This Option and this Agreement are subject to and shall be construed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan, as now or hereinafter in effect. Any terms which are used in this Agreement without being defined and which are defined in the Plan shall have the meaning specified in the Plan.

^Date of Grant. The date of the grant of the Option is the date set forth above, the date of the action by the Committee which administers the Plan (the “Committee”) in granting the same. 

^Number and Price of Shares. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to your option and your exercise price per share referenced in your Grant Notice may be adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments.

^Exercise of Option. 

^^Vesting. Subject to the limitations contained herein, your option will vest as provided in your Grant Notice, provided that vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service. 

^^Method of Payment. Payment of the exercise price is due in full upon exercise of all or any part of your option. You may elect to make payment of the exercise price in cash or by check or in any other manner *permitted by your Grant Notice,* which may include one or more of the following: 

^^It is the Company’s sole discretion at the time your option is exercised and provided that at the time of exercise the Common Stock is publicly tr aded and quoted regularly in *The Wall Street Journal*, pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance of Common Stock, results in either the receipt of cash (or check) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds. 

^^It is the Company’s sole discretion at the time your option is exercised and provided that at the time of exercise the Common Stock is publicly traded and quoted regularly in *The Wall Street Journal*, by delivery to the Company (either by actual delivery or attestation) of already-owned shares of Common Stock either that you have held for the period required to avoid a charge to the Company’s reported earnings (generally six (6) months) or that you did not acquire, directly or ind irectly from the Company, that are owned free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances or security interests, and that are valued at Fair Market Value on the date of exercise. “Delivery” for these purposes, in the sole discretion of the Company at the time you exercise your option, shall include delivery to the Company of your attestation of ownership of such shares of Common Stock in a form approved by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may not exercise your option by tender to the Company of Common Stock to the extent such tender would violate the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company’s stock. 

\centered A-36

^^You may exercise the vested portion of your option (and the unvested portion of your option if your Grant Notice so permits) during its term by delivering a Notice of Exercise (in a form designated by the Company) together with the exercise price to the Secretary of the Company, or to such other person as the Company may designate, during regular business hours, together with such additional documents as the Company may then require. The exercise may be made only on whole shares of Common Stock. 

^^By exercising your option you agree that, as a condition to any exercise of your option, the Company may require you to enter into an arrangement providing for the payment by you to the Company of any tax withholding obligation of the Company arising by reason of (i) the exercise of your option, (ii) the lapse of any substantial risk of forfeiture to which the shares of Common Stock are subject at the time of exercise, or (iii) the disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired upon such exercise. 

^^Term. You may not exercise your option before the commencement or after the expiration of its term. The term of your option commences on the Date of Grant and expires upon the earliest of the following: 

^^^twelve (12) months after the termination of your Continuous Service for any reason other than your Disability or death, provided that if during any part of such twelve (12) month period your option is not exercisable sol ely because of the condition set forth in Section 5, your option shall not expire until the earlier of the Expiration Date or until it shall have been exercisable for an aggregate period of twelve (12) months after the termination of your Continuous Service; 

^^^twelve (12) months after the termination of your Continuous Service due to your Disability; 

^^^eighteen (18) months after your death if you die either during your Continuous Service or within three (3) months after your Continuous Service terminates; 

^^^the Expiration Date indicated in your Grant Notice; or 

^^^the day before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Date of Grant. 

^Change in Control.

^^In the event of (i) a Corporate Transaction, or (ii) any Exchange Act Person becoming the Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than fifty percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities, then your option shall (contingent upon the effectiveness of such transaction) become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the effectiveness of such transaction, and your option shall terminate if not exercised at or prior to such time. 

^^Except as otherwise provided in a written agreement between you and the Company, if any payment or benefit you would receive pursuant to a Change in Co ntrol from the Company or otherwise (“***Payment***”) would (i) constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “***Excise Tax***”), then such Payment shall be equal to the Reduced Amount. The “Reduced Amount” shall be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, or (y) the largest portion, up to and including the total, of the Payment, whichever amount, after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in your receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount of the Payment notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in payments or benefits co nstituting “parachute payments” is necessary so that the Payment equals the Reduced Amount, reduction shall occur in the following order unless you elect in writing a different order (provided, 

\centered A-37

however, that such election shall be subject to Company approval if made on or after the effective date of the event that triggers the Payment): reduction of cash payments; cancellation of accelerated vesting of Stock Awards; reduction of employee benefits. In the event that acceleration of vesting of Stock Award compensation is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of your Sto ck Awards (i.e., earliest granted Stock Award cancelled last) unless you elect in writing a different order for cancellation. 

^^The accounting firm engaged by the Company for general tax purposes as of the day prior to the effective date of the Change in Control shall perform the foregoing calculations. If the accounting firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Company shall appoint a nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder. The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such accounting firm required to be made hereunder. 

^^The accounting firm engaged to make the determinations hereunder shall provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to you and the Company within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date on which your right to a Payment is triggered (if requested at that time by you or the Company) or such other time as requested by you or the Company. If the accounting firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable with respect to a Payment, either before or after the application of the Reduced Amount, it shall furnish you and the Company with an opinion reasonably acceptable to you that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to such Payment. Any good faith determinations of the accounting firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon you and the Company. 

^Limited Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred, gifted, bequeat hed, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, voluntarily or involuntarily, except that the Board may permit a transfer, upon the Participant’s death, to beneficiaries designated by the Participant as provided in Sections 13.14 and 6.8.3 of the Plan. The Board may also permit a limited transfer due to disability, or retirement as provided in Section 6.8.2 of the Plan.

^Securities Law Compliance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, you may not exercise your option unless the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise are then registered under the Securities Act or, if such shares of Common Stock are not then so registered, the Company has determined that such exercise and issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The exercise of your option also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing your option, and you may not exercise your option if the Company determines that such exercise would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 

^Option Not a Service Contract. Your option is not an employment or service contract, and nothing in your option shall be deemed to create in any way whatsoever any obligation on your part to continue in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate, or of the Company or an Affiliate to continue your employment. In addition, nothing in your option shall obligate the Company or an Affiliate, their respective stockholders, Boards of Directors, Officers or Employees to continue any relations hip that you might have as a Director or Consultant for the Company or an Affiliate. 

^Withholding of Taxes. As a condition to the issuance of the Option Shares, the Participant shall (a) remit to the Company at the time of any exercise of the Option any taxes required to be withheld by the Company under federal, state or local laws as a result of the exercise of the Option; or (b) instruct the Company to withhold in accordance with applicable law from any compensation payable to the Participant the taxes required to be held by the Company under federal, state or local laws as a result of the exercise of the Option; or (c) make other arrangements acceptable to the Board in its discretion.

\centered A-38

Option in order to satisfy tax withholding requirements, or it may in its sole and absolute discretion permit Participant to tender Option Shares previously acquired in order to satisfy such requirements.

^Governing Law. This Option Agreement shall be construed and shall take effect in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada, without regard to the conflicts of laws, rules of such State.
