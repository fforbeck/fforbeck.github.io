Date this Contract takes effect:      [[Date 1]]

**COMMENCEMENT OF AND CONDITIONS TO EMPLOYMENT**

^^Your employment with the Company shall commence on [[Date 1]], or such other date as agreed between you and the President and Chief Executive Officer of the CME Group, subject to compliance with clause 1.2 below (the “**Commencement Date**”). No previous period of employment shall count as continuous employment.

^^You shall establish to the Company’s satisfaction (through production of original documents reasonably requested by us) that you are entitled to live and work in the Czech Republic without any additional approvals. You will notify the Company immediately if you cease to be so entitled at any time during your employment with the Company.

^^You represent and warrant that you are not bound by or subject to any contract, court order, agreement, arrangement or undertaking which in any way restricts or prohibits you from entering into this Contract or performing your duties under it.

**JOB TITLE AND DUTIES**

^^Your job title is Chief Financial Officer, reporting directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer of the CME Group. For purposes of this Contract, the “**CME Group**” shall mean Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (“**CME Ltd.**”) and/or any Associated Company (as defined below).

2.1.1   You will perform such functions and undertake such responsibilities as are customarily associated with such a position as your main duties.

^^You shall use your best endeavours to promote and protect the interests of the CME Group and shall not do anything that is harmful to those interests.

^^You shall devote the whole of your working time (unless prevented by ill-health or accident or otherwise directed by the Company) to the duties of this Contract and you shall not be directly or indirectly interested or concerned in any manner in any other business (other than holding as a bona-fide personal investment equity in any company whose shares are listed on any recognised exchange or does not otherwise contravene clause 18) except with the Company’s prior written consent. If such consent is given, you must provide the Company with the number of hours worked for any other employer each month.

**PLACE OF WORK**

^^You will be based in the Company’s branch office in Prague, Czech Republic. However, it is agreed that your position will require that you spend extensive time travelling for the proper performance of your duties.

**REMUNERATION**

^^From the Commencement Date, your basic salary is EUR 450,000 per year, payable monthly in arrears by credit transfer into your bank account after all necessary deductions for relevant taxes and social security payments. Your salary shall be payable in Czech koruna (CZK) based on the EUR-CZK exchange rate in effect on the Commencement Date in respect of the period through [[Date 2: Date]] and on each [[Date 3: Date]] in respect of each year thereafter. In the event the amount of salary you would have been entitled to receive in Czech korunas in any calendar year, following conversion of such amount using the average CZK-EUR exchange rate for such calendar year, is greater than the amount you did receive, the difference will be added to your salary payable in the first month of the following calendar year. In the event the amount of salary you would have been entitled to receive in Czech korunas in any calend ar year, following conversion of such amount using the average CZK-EUR exchange rate for such calendar year, is less than the amount you did receive, the difference will be withheld from your basic salary payable in the first month of the following calendar year.

^^Your salary will be reviewed on an annual basis. The first review will take place on or about the first anniversary of your Commencement Date. Any increase is entirely at the Company’s discretion.

^^You shall be entitled to participate in the CME Management Compensation Policy in effect from time to time (the “**Policy**”). The amount, if any, of any bonus awarded pursuant to the Policy will accrue from the Commencement Date and shall be determined by the President and Chief Executive Officer of the CME Group, pursuant to the rules of the Policy. Any bonus awarded will be based on a figure representing [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of your gross annual salary.

5.1.1   a medical and dental expenses insurance scheme providing such cover for you and your spouse/partner and any children under the age of eighteen (18) as the Company may from time to time notify to you;

5.1.2   a salary continuance on long-term disability insurance scheme providing such cover for you as the Company may from time to time notify to you; and

5.1.3   a life insurance scheme providing such cover for you as the Company may from time to time notify to you.

^^Benefits shall be subject to the terms of any applicable insurance policy and are conditional upon your complying with and satisfying any applicable requirements of the insurers or other benefits provider. Copies of these rules and policies and particulars of the requirements shall be provided to you on request. The Company shall not have any liability to pay any benefit to you under any insurance scheme unless it receives payment of the benefit from the insurer under the scheme.

^^Any insurance scheme which is provided for you is also subject to the Company’s right to alter the cover provided or any term of the scheme or to cease to provide (without replacement) the scheme at any time if in the reasonable opinion of the Company your state of health is or becomes such that the Company is unable to insure the benefits under the scheme at the normal premiums applicable.

^^The provision of any insurance scheme or any benefits hereunder does not in any way prevent the Company from lawfully terminating this Contract in accordance with the provisions in clause 9 even if to do so would deprive you of membership of or cover under any such scheme or benefit.

^^For a period of three years from the Commencement Date, provided you continue to be employed by the Company throughout such period, the Company shall pay you a monthly rental allowance of the Czech koruna equivalent of EUR 4,705.88 to be payable in monthly instalments at the same time and by the same method as your salary is paid (the “**Monthly Allowance**”). Such payment is subject to the same foreign exchange adjustment calculation as set out in clause 4.1 above.

^^The Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to cause CME Ltd. to grant you 125,000 options to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock of CME Ltd. on or about the Commencement Date in accordance with CME Ltd.’s Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the “**Plan**”). The exercise price for such options shall be the closing price of the shares of Class A Common Stock of CME Ltd. on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the date of grant. Such grant of options shall vest in four equal instalments over a period of four years and shall otherwise be subject to the Plan.

^^The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that you are qualified as an officer under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy taken out by the CME group.

**EXPENSES**

^^On termination, you will be paid only for accrued vacation in the relevant Holiday Year and not for vacation carried over from the previous year.

^^The Company may refuse to allow you to take holiday in circumstances where it would be inconvenient to the business of the Company. If, in exceptional circumstances, the Company is forced to cancel holiday previously booked by you, all reasonable and properly documented accommodation, reservation and travel expenses incurred by you in connection therewith up to the date of cancellation that are not otherwise refundable will be reimbursed by the Company.

This payment will be comprised solely of your basic salary (at the rate payable when this option is exercised) in respect of the portion of the notice period remaining at the time the Company exercises this option and any earned but unpaid bonus awarded in accordance with clause 4.2 hereof. All payments made pursuant to this clause 9.2 shall be subject to deductions for income tax and social security contributions as appropriate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination shall not be treated as Termination for Cause unless the Company has delivered a written notice to you stating that it intends to terminate your employment due to Termination for Cause and specifying the basis for such termination.

^^On (i) the date of termination of this Contract pursuant to clause 9.3, or (ii) the effective date of a Change of Control (as defined in Annex 1 hereto), all options and restricted stock units granted to you pursuant to the Plan shall become automatically exercisable for a period of twelve months from such date, after which they shall expire.
