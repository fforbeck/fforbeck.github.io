Unused holiday entitlement in respect of any calendar year cannot, without the Company’s prior consent in writing, be carried forward to the subsequent calendar year and no holiday entitlement or payment in respect thereof will arise on the termination of this Agreement.

**ELEVENTH**      **Sickness and Absence from Work**

Without prejudice to the terms of Clauses SECOND and SIXTEENTH hereof, during any period of absence from work due to sickness or accident during the continuance of this Agreement, the Employee shall notify the Company so far as practicable on the first day of such absence and provide the Company with a completed self certificate form for periods of absence from four to seven days and a doctor’s certificate for periods in excess of seven days and, subject to compliance with the above, shall be paid as follows:

The Company may suspend payment of Company Sick Pay if it has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the Employee is fit to return to work and may require the Employee at any time and at its expense to be examined by an independent medical practitioner to decide whether or not the Employee is fit to return to work.

**TWELFTH**      **Pension Scheme**

Subject to the Rules for the time being applicable thereto the Employee shall, during the continuance of his appointment hereunder, be entitled to become a member of any pension scheme for the time being in force for which he might be eligible.

^The termination of this Agreement in accordance with and for any of the reasons specified in this Clause shall be deemed to be for a substantial and sufficient reason of a kind such as to justify the Employee’s dismissal from holding the position that he holds and it shall be deemed, in the circumstances, to be fair and reasonable for the Company to give notice of termination provided for by this Clause.

^Without prejudice to the Employee’s rights in his capacity as an employee, upon the termination of this Agreement howsoever arising he shall at any time on the Company’s request resign without claim for compensation from any office held by him in the Company or in any Associated Company merely in his capacity as a Director or Company Secretary.

**NINETEENTH**      **Disciplinary Rules**

Disciplinary rules applicable to the Employee are set out in the Schedule hereto.

**TWENTIETH**      **Restrictive Covenant**

^In this Clause the expression “Termination Date” means the date on which this Agreement shall determine irrespective of the cause or manner (the event of the Employee’s death or determination caused by a breach by the Company only excluded).

^In so far as the Employee has obtained and is likely to obtain in the course of his further employment with the Company knowledge of trade secrets, designs, design improvements, know-how methods, lists and other confidential information relating to the Company and its Associated Companies and also to their respective clients or customers, in addition to the restrictions contained in Clause SEVENTH hereof he will be bound by the following restrictions:

^^^he will not either before or during the period of six months after the Termination Date, either (a) canvass or solicit or undertake in the United Kingdom in competition with the Company, the custom or business of any person, firm or company carrying on business in the United Kingdom who at any time during the last eighteen months of the Employee’s employment with the Company was a client or customer of the Company or any Associated Company of it in relation to whose requirements he had knowledge of a material kind or (b) accept such orders from any such person;

^^^he will not either before or during the period of six months after the Termination Date (a) be directly or indirectly engaged, interested or concerned in any business carried on or about to be carried on by any person, firm or company which is in any way competitive with the business of the Company, or with the business of any Associated Company (b) set up in business either on his own or in conjunction with others, within a radius of one hundred miles from the Employee’s principal place of business with the Company at the Termination Date; provided always that these restrictions shall not operate so as to prohibit the Employee (a) from being engaged, interested or concerned in any such business so far as his involvement therein or duties thereto shall relate exclusively to work of a kind or nature with which the Employee was not concerned to a material extent during his employment with the Company or (b) from holding or being otherwise interested in not more than [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the equity share capital or loan capital of any company which is quoted on a recognised Stock Exchange (as defined in the Financial Services Act 1986) or dealt in on the Unlisted Securities Market;

^The restrictions set out in paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of sub-clause (B) above shall apply to any action taken by the Employee whether as agent, representative, principal, employee, sub-contractor or consultant or as a director or shareholder of any company and/or by any spouse of his and/or by any company controlled by him or any such spouse.

^While the restrictions aforesaid are considered by both parties hereto to be reasonable in all the circumstances, it is recognised that restrictions of the nature in question may fail for technical reasons unforseen and accordingly it is hereby declared and agreed that (a) each of the foregoing restrictions in this Clause are separate and severable restrictions and (b) if any of such restrictions shall be adjudged to be void as going beyond what is reasonable in all the circumstances for the protection of the interests of the Company but would be valid if part of the wording hereof were deleted and/or the periods (if any) thereof reduced and/or area dealt with thereby reduced in scope, the said restrictions shall apply with such deletions or modifications as may be necessary to make them valid and effective.

^Since the Employee may obtain in the course of his employment by reason of services rendered for or offices held in any Associated Company knowledge of the trade secrets, designs, design improvements, know-how, business information methods, lists (including lists of clients) or other confidential information of such company, he agrees that without prejudice to the foregoing restrictions he will at the request and cost of the Company enter into a direct agreement or undertaking with such company whereby he will accept restrictions and provisions corresponding to the restrictions and provisions herein contained (or such of them as may be appropriate in the circumstances) in relation to such products, services and such area and for such period as such company may reasonably require for the protection of its legitimate interests.

**TWENTY-THIRD**      **Continuing Provisions**

If the explanation is not acceptable he will be given an informal warning by his immediate supervisor or in his absence some other person of authority in the Company. This warning will be given verbally and the supervisor will make it clear that an informal warning is being administered and that it will be recorded on file. The following list while neither exhaustive nor exclusive is inclusive of the types of misconduct which will normally result in disciplinary action short of dismissal: 

^^careless damage to Company property;

^^careless damage to property not belonging to the Company whilst engaged, or purporting to be engaged on Company business;

^^unauthorised use of property not belonging to the Company whilst engaged or purporting to be engaged on Company business;

^^persistent and unrelated short-term sickness absences.

^FORMAL WARNING

^^If the informal warning does not have the required effect or if there is a repetition of conduct justifying an informal warning the employee’s immediate supervisor will give the employee a formal warning that his performance or conduct must improve. A written record of the formal warning will be given to the employee and will include:

^^the reason for the warning;

^^the disciplinary action which may follow from a failure to comply with the warning;

^^any specific period of time in which the employee is required to comply with the warning;

^^the employee’s right of appeal.

^copy of that document will be signed and dated by the employee and placed on his file. 

^^If a formal warning fails to achieve and maintain the required improvement in conduct or performance or where a further act or omission warranting disciplinary action occurs the employee will be given an opportunity to explain or justify the failure to his immediate supervisor. If the opportunity to state his case is not taken up by the employee or, on investigation, the explanation or justification is not acceptable the disciplinary action described in 2.3. below will be carried out.

^^The next step will be a final warning which will be administered by a Director of the Company and written record of the final warning will be given to the employee.

This document will record: 

^^that it is a final warning;

^^the reason for the final warning;

^^where relevant the period of time in which the required improvement is to be achieved;

^^that failure to achieve the required improvement in performance or conduct or failure to comply with the employee’s terms of employment will result in dismissal.

^copy of the document which will be signed and dated by the employee will be placed on his personal file. 

^DISMISSAL

If, following one or more formal warnings the termination of the employment of an employee is contemplated the matter will be discussed by the Director who issued the written warning and the employee’s immediate supervisor at the location where the employee works and if it is decided to dismiss the employee the decision will be given to him in writing. 

^GROSS MISCONDUCT

If there is gross misconduct by an employee he may be subject to summary dismissal or may be suspended on full pay pending the outcome of enquiries into the misconduct. 

Dismissal without notice may result from such enquiries. Gross misconduct is behaviour of such a nature that the Company is unable to tolerate the continued employment of the individual concerned. The following list is neither exhaustive nor exclusive but is inclusive of the types of misconduct which will normally result in dismissal: 

^^theft of Company property;

^^theft of property not belonging to the Company whilst engaged, or purporting to be engaged on Company business;

^^wilful damage to, or misuse of, Company property or resources;

^^wilful damage to, or misuse of, property or resources not belonging to the Company whilst engaged or purporting to be engaged on Company business;

Such appeals must be made in writing within three working days of the action being taken against him and his failure to appeal within that time will be regarded as acceptance of the action. A hearing will take place within 14 days or as soon as practicably possible thereafter and a decision will be sent to the employee within 7 days of the hearing. No further right of appeal exists and the procedure shall be considered to be exhausted. 

^RIGHT OF REPRESENTATION

An employee may if he wishes have a colleague or other representative present to support him when any formal warning is given or at any subsequent stage in the operation of this Disciplinary Procedure. 

Any record of warnings, informal or formal, will be removed from the personal file of an employee two years after the date of any single warning or the last of a sequence of warnings. 

**Grievance Procedure** 

^If an employee has any grievance relating to his employment, he should raise the matter as follows:

^^^first contact his immediate supervisor to discuss the matter informally;

^^^if this does not resolve the matter or if the employee feels he has been unfairly treated, contact the Managing Director of the Company either orally or in writing to discuss the matter within 3 weeks of the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to such grievance;

^^^if this does not resolve the matter or if the employee still feels he has been unfairly treated he may request a meeting with one of the Directors of Murray Group Management Limited within 4 weeks after he contacted the Company’s Managing Director who will deal with the employee’s case as soon as practicable thereafter. Such a request should be submitted in writing to the Managing Director giving reasons why such a meeting is appropriate.
