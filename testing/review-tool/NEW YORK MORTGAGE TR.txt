^^The maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under this Plan is [[Shares 1: Number]] shares.

^^The maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under this Plan (including the number of additional shares made available on account of the forfeiture or termination of awards granted under the Prior Plan) shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Article XI.

^^**Individual Limit**

The maximum number of shares of Common Stock for which awards may be granted to any Participant in any calendar year is [[Shares 2: Number]] shares.

^^**Reallocation of Shares**

If an SAR is terminated, in whole or in part, for any reason other than its exercise that is settled with shares of Common Stock or the exercise of a related Option, the number of shares of Common Stock allocated to the SAR or portion thereof may be reallocated to other Options, SARs, Performance Shares, and Stock Awards to be granted under this Plan. If an award of Performance Shares is terminated, in whole or in part, for any reason other than its settlement with shares of Common Stock, the number of shares allocated to the Performance Share award or portion thereof may be reallocated to other Options, SARs, Performance Shares and Stock Awards to be granted under this Plan. If a Stock Award is forfeited, in whole or in part, for any reason, the number of shares of Common Stock allocated to the Stock Award or portion thereof may be reallocated to other Options, SARs, Performance Shares and Stock Awards to be granted under this Plan.

Except as provided in Section 6.05, during the lifetime of the Participant to whom the Option is granted, the Option may be exercised only by the Participant. No right or interest of a Participant in any Option shall be liable for, or subject to, any lien, obligation, or liability of such Participant.

^^**Transferable Options**

^to the contrary notwithstanding, if the Agreement provides, an Option that is not an incentive stock option may be transferred by a Participant to the Participant’s children, grandchildren, spouse, one or more trusts for the benefit of such family members or a partnership in which such family members are the only partners, on such terms and conditions as may be permitted under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act as in effect from time to time. The holder of an Option transferred pursuant to this Section shall be bound by the same terms and conditions that governed the Option during the period that it was held by the Participant; provided, however, that such transferee may not transfer the Option except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. In the event of any transfer of an Option (by the Participant or his transferee), the Option and any Corresponding SAR that relates to such Option must be transferred to the same person or persons or entity or entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may not be transferred for consideration absent shareholder approval.

^^**Employee Status**

For purposes of determining the applicability of Section 422 of the Code (relating to incentive stock options), or in the event that the terms of any Option provide that it may be exercised only during employment or continued service or within a specified period of time after termination of employment or continued service, the Committee may decide to what extent leaves of absence for governmental or military service, illness, temporary disability, or other reasons shall not be deemed interruptions of continuous employment or service.

^^**Exercise**

Subject to the provisions of this Plan and the applicable Agreement, an Option may be exercised in whole at any time or in part from time to time at such times and in compliance with such requirements as the Committee shall determine; provided, however, that incentive stock options (granted under the Plan and all plans of the Company and its Affiliates) may not be first exercisable in a calendar year for shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value (determined as of the date an Option is granted) exceeding $[[USD Value 1: Number]] An Option granted under this Plan may be exercised with respect to any number of whole shares less than the full number for which the Option could be exercised. A partial exercise of an Option shall not affect the right to exercise the Option from time to time in accordance with this Plan and the applicable Agreement with respect to the remaining shares subject to the Option. The exercise of an Option shall result in the termination of any Corresponding SAR to the extent of the number of shares with respect to which the Option is exercised.

^^**Payment**

Subject to rules established by the Committee and unless otherwise provided in an Agreement, payment of all or part of the Option price may be made in cash, certified check, by tendering shares of Common Stock (which, if acquired from the Company, have been held by the Participant for at least six months) or by a broker-assisted cashless exercise. If shares of Common Stock are used to pay all or part of the Option price, the sum of the cash and cash equivalent and the Fair Market Value (determined as of the day preceding the date of exercise) of the shares surrendered must not be less than the Option price of the shares for which the Option is being exercised.

^^**Stockholder Rights**

No Participant shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to shares subject to his Option until the date of exercise of such Option.

^^**Disposition of Shares**

^Participant shall notify the Company of any sale or other disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to an Option that was an incentive stock option if such sale or disposition occurs (i) within two years of the grant of an Option or (ii) within one year of the issuance of shares of Common Stock to the Participant.

\centered **SARS**

^^**Award**

In accordance with the provisions of Article IV, the Committee will designate each individual to whom SARs are to be granted and will specify the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such awards.

In addition no Participant may be granted Corresponding SARs (under all incentive stock option plans of the Company and its Affiliates) that are related to incentive stock options which are first exercisable in any calendar year for shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date the related Option is granted) that exceeds $[[USD Value 1]]

^^**Maximum SAR Period**

The term of each SAR shall be determined by the Committee on the date of grant, except that no Corresponding SAR that is related to an incentive stock option shall have a term of more than ten years from the date such related Option was granted. The terms of any Corresponding SAR that is related to an incentive stock option may provide that it has a term that is less than such maximum period.

^^**Nontransferability**

Except as provided in Section 7.04, each SAR granted under this Plan shall be nontransferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In the event of any such transfer, a Corresponding SAR and the related Option must be transferred to the same person or persons or entity or entities. Except as provided in Section 7.04, during the lifetime of the Participant to whom the SAR is granted, the SAR may be exercised only by the Participant. No right or interest of a Participant in any SAR shall be liable for, or subject to, any lien, obligation, or liability of such Participant.

^^**Transferable SARs**

^to the contrary notwithstanding, if the Agreement provides, an SAR, other than a Corresponding SAR that is related to an incentive stock option, may be transferred by a Participant to the Participant’s children, grandchildren, spouse, one or more trusts for the benefit of such family members or a partnership in which such family members are the only partners, on such terms and conditions as may be permitted under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act as in effect from time to time. The holder of an SAR transferred pursuant to this Section shall be bound by the same terms and conditions that governed the SAR during the period that it was held by the Participant; provided, however, that such transferee may not transfer the SAR except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. In the event of any transfer of a Corresponding SAR (by the Participant or his transferee), the Corresponding SAR and the related Option must be transferred to the same person or person or entity or entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an SAR may not be transferred for consideration absent shareholder approval.

^^**Exercise**

Subject to the provisions of this Plan and the applicable Agreement, an SAR may be exercised in whole at any time or in part from time to time at such times and in compliance with such requirements as the Committee shall determine; provided, however, that a Corresponding SAR that is related to an incentive stock option may be exercised only to the extent that the related Option is exercisable and only when the Fair Market Value exceeds the option price of the related Option. An SAR granted under this Plan may be exercised with respect to any number of whole shares less than the full number for which the SAR could be exercised. A partial exercise of an SAR shall not affect the right to exercise the SAR from time to time in accordance with this Plan and the applicable Agreement with respect to the remaining shares subject to the SAR. The exercise of a Corresponding SAR shall result in the termination of the related Option to the extent of the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.

^^**Employee Status**

If the terms of any SAR provide that it may be exercised only during employment or continued service or within a specified period of time after termination of employment or continued service, the Committee may decide to what extent leaves of absence for governmental or military service, illness, temporary disability or other reasons shall not be deemed interruptions of continuous employment or service.

^^**Settlement**

At the Committee’s discretion, the amount payable as a result of the exercise of an SAR may be settled in cash, shares of Common Stock, or a combination of cash and Common Stock. No fractional share will be deliverable upon the exercise of an SAR but a cash payment will be made in lieu thereof.

^^**Stockholder Rights**

No Participant shall, as a result of receiving an SAR, have any rights as a stockholder of the Company or any Affiliate until the date that the SAR is exercised and then only to the extent that the SAR is settled by the issuance of Common Stock.

\centered **STOCK AWARDS**

^^**Award**

In accordance with the provisions of Article IV, the Committee will designate each individual to whom a Stock Award is to be made and will specify the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such awards.

^^**Vesting**

The Committee, on the date of the award, may prescribe that a Participant’s rights in a Stock Award shall be forfeitable or otherwise restricted for a period of time or subject to such conditions as may be set forth in the Agreement. By way of example and not of limitation, the Committee may prescribe that Participant’s rights in a Stock Award shall be forfeitable or otherwise restricted subject to the attainment of objectives stated with reference to the Company’s, an Affiliate’s or a business unit’s attainment of objectives stated with respect to performance criteria listed in Section [8.03](#_Ref61826125). If the Committee prescribes that a Stock Award shall become nonforfeitable and transferable only upon the attainment of performance objectives stated with respect to one or more of the criteria listed in Section 8.03, the shares of Common Stock subject to the Stock Award shall become nonforfeitable and transferable only to the extent that the Committee certifies that such objectives have been achieved.

^^**Performance Objectives**

If the Committee, on the date of award, prescribes that a Stock Award shall become nonforfeitable and transferable only upon the attainment of any of the above criteria, the shares of Common Stock subject to such Stock Award shall become nonforfeitable and transferable only to the extent that the Committee certifies that such objectives have been achieved.

^^**Employee Status**

In the event that the terms of any Stock Award provide that shares may become transferable and nonforfeitable thereunder only after completion of a specified period of employment or continuous service, the Committee may decide in each case to what extent leaves of absence for governmental or military service, illness, temporary disability, or other reasons shall not be deemed interruptions of continuous employment or service.

^^**Stockholder Rights**

Prior to their forfeiture (in accordance with the applicable Agreement and while the shares of Common Stock granted pursuant to the Stock Award may be forfeited or are nontransferable), a Participant will have all rights of a stockholder with respect to a Stock Award, including the right to receive dividends and vote the shares; provided, however, that during such period (i) a Participant may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of shares granted pursuant to a Stock Award, (ii) the Company shall retain custody of the certificates evidencing shares granted pursuant to a Stock Award, and (iii) the Participant will deliver to the Company a stock power, endorsed in blank, with respect to each Stock Award. The limitations set forth in the preceding sentence shall not apply after the shares granted under the Stock Award are transferable and are no longer forfeitable.

The performance objectives may be stated with respect to the Company’s, an Affiliate’s or a business unit’s (a) total stockholder return, (b) total Stockholder return as compared to total return (on a comparable basis) of a publicly available index, (c) net income, (d) pretax earnings, (e) funds from operations, (f) earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, (g) operating margin, (h) earnings per share, (i) return on equity, capital, assets or investment, (j) operating earnings, (k) working capital, (l) ratio of debt to stockholders equity and (m) revenue.No payments will be made with respect to Performance Shares unless, and then only to the extent that, the Committee certifies that such objectives have been achieved.

^^**Payment**

In the discretion of the Committee, the amount payable when an award of Performance Shares is earned may be settled in cash, by the issuance of shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof. A fractional share of Common Stock shall not be deliverable when an award of Performance Shares is earned, but a cash payment will be made in lieu thereof.

^^**Stockholder Rights**

No Participant shall, as a result of receiving an award of Performance Shares, have any rights as a stockholder until and to the extent that the award of Performance Shares is earned and settled in shares of Common Stock.

The holder of Performance Shares transferred pursuant to this Section shall be bound by the same terms and conditions that governed the Performance Shares during the period that they were held by the Participant; provided, however that such transferee may not transfer Performance Shares except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Performance Shares may not be transferred for consideration absent shareholder approval.

^^**Employee Status**

In the event that the terms of any Performance Share award provide that no payment will be made unless the Participant completes a stated period of employment or continued service, the Committee may decide to what extent leaves of absence for government or military service, illness, temporary disability, or other reasons shall not be deemed interruptions of continuous employment or service.

\centered **INCENTIVE AWARDS**

^^**Award**

The Committee shall designate Participants to whom Incentive Awards are made. All Incentive Awards shall be finally determined exclusively by the Committee under the procedures established by the Committee; provided, however, that no Participant may receive an Incentive Award payment in any calendar year that exceeds $[[USD Value 2: Number]]

^^**Nontransferability**

Except as provided in Section 10.04, Incentive Awards granted under this Plan shall be nontransferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. No right or interest of a Participant in an Incentive Award shall be liable for, or subject to, any lien, obligation, or liability of such Participant.

^^**Transferable Incentive Awards**

^to the contrary notwithstanding, if provided in an Agreement, an Incentive Award may be transferred by a Participant to the Participant’s children, grandchildren, spouse, one or more trusts for the benefit of such family members or to a partnership in which such family members are the only partners, on such terms and conditions as may be permitted by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act as in effect from time to time. The holder of an Incentive Award transferred pursuant to this Section shall be bound by the same terms and conditions that governed the Incentive Award during the period that it was held by the Participant; provided, however, that such transferee may not transfer the Incentive Award except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Incentive Award may not be transferred for consideration absent shareholder approval.

^^**Employee Status**

If the terms of an Incentive Award provide that a payment will be made thereunder only if the Participant completes a stated period of employment or continuous service, the Committee may decide to what extent leaves of absence for governmental or military service, illness, temporary disability or other reasons shall not be deemed interruptions of continuous employment or service.

^^**Stockholder Rights**

No Participant shall, as a result of receiving an Incentive Award, have any rights as a stockholder of the Company or any Affiliate on account of such award.

\centered **ADJUSTMENT UPON CHANGE IN COMMON STOCK**

The maximum number of shares as to which Options, SARs, Performance Shares and Stock Awards may be granted; the terms of outstanding Stock Awards, Options, Performance Shares, Incentive Awards, and SARs; and the per individual limitation on the number of shares of Common Stock for which Options, SARs, Performance Shares, and Stock Awards may be granted shall be adjusted as the Board shall determine to be equitably required in the event that (i) the Company (a) effects one or more nonreciprocal transactions between the Company and its shareholders such as a stock dividend, stock split-up, extraordinary cash dividend, subdivisions or consolidations of shares that affect the number or kind of Common Stock (or other securities of the Company) or the Fair Market Value (or the value of other Company securities) and causes a change in the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to outstanding awards or (b) engages in a transaction to which Section 424 of the Code applies or (ii) there occurs any other event which, in the judgment of the Board necessitates such action. Any determination made under this Article XI by the Board shall be nondiscretionary, final and conclusive.

The issuance by the Company of stock of any class, or securities convertible into stock of any class, for cash or property, or for labor or services, either upon direct sale or upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of stock or obligations of the Company convertible into such stock or other securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the maximum number of shares as to which Options, SARs, Performance Shares and Stock Awards may be granted (including the number of additional shares made available on account of the forfeiture or termination of Prior Plan awards); the per individual limitations on the number of shares for which Options, SARs, Performance Shares and Stock Awards may be granted; or the terms of outstanding Stock Awards, Options, Performance Shares, Incentive Awards or SARs.

The Committee may make Stock Awards and may grant Options, SARs, Performance Shares, and Incentive Awards in substitution for performance shares, phantom shares, stock awards, stock options, stock appreciation rights, or similar awards held by an individual who becomes an employee of the Company or an Affiliate in connection with a transaction described in the first paragraph of this Article XI. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan (other than the limitation of Section 5.02), the terms of such substituted Stock Awards or Option, SAR, Performance Shares or Incentive Award grants shall be as the Committee, in its discretion, determines is appropriate.

\centered **COMPLIANCE WITH LAW AND APPROVAL OF REGULATORY BODIES**

No Option or SAR shall be exercisable, no shares of Common Stock shall be issued, no certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be delivered, and no payment shall be made under this Plan except in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations (including, without limitation, withholding tax requirements), any listing agreement to which the Company is a party, and the rules of all domestic stock exchanges on which the Company’s shares may be listed. The Company shall have the right to rely on an opinion of its counsel as to such compliance. Any stock certificate issued to evidence shares of Common Stock when a Stock Award is granted, a Performance Share is settled or for which an Option or SAR is exercised may bear such legends and statements as the Committee may deem advisable to assure compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. No Option or SAR shall be exercisable, no Stock Award or Performance Share shall be granted, no shares of Common Stock shall be issued, no certificate for shares of Common Stock shall be delivered, and no payment shall be made under this Plan until the Company has obtained such consent or approval as the Committee may deem advisable from regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such matters.

\centered **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

^^**Effect on Employment and Service**

Neither the adoption of this Plan, its operation, nor any documents describing or referring to this Plan (or any part thereof), shall confer upon any individual or entity any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company or an Affiliate or in any way affect any right and power of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate the employment or service of any individual or entity at any time with or without assigning a reason therefor.

^^**Unfunded Plan**

This Plan, insofar as it provides for grants, shall be unfunded, and the Company shall not be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by grants under this Plan. Any liability of the Company to any person with respect to any grant under this Plan shall be based solely upon any contractual obligations that may be created pursuant to this Plan. No such obligation of the Company shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge of, or other encumbrance on, any property of the Company.

^^**Rules of Construction**

Headings are given to the articles and sections of this Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. The reference to any statute, regulation, or other provision of law shall be construed to refer to any amendment to or successor of such provision of law.

^^**Code Section 409A**

All awards made under this Plan are intended to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”), after giving effect to the exemptions in Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(b)(3) through (b)(12). This Plan and all Agreements shall be administered, interpreted and construed in a manner consistent with Section 409A. If any provision of this Plan or any Agreement is found not to comply with, or otherwise not be exempt from, the provisions of Section 409A, it shall be modified and given effect, in the sole discretion of the Committee and without requiring the Participant’s consent, in such manner as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to comply with, or effectuate an exemption from, Section 409A. Each payment under an award granted under this Plan shall be treated as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A.

If a payment obligation under an award granted under this Plan or an Agreement arises on account of the Participant’s termination of employment and such payment obligation constitutes “deferred compensation” (as defined under Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(b)(1), after giving effect to the exemptions in Treasury Regulation section 1.409A01(b)(3) through (b)(12)), it shall be payable only after the Participant’s “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(h)); provided, however, that if the Participant is a “specified employee” (as defined under Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(i)), any such payment that is scheduled to be paid within six months after such separation from service shall accrue without interest and shall be paid on the first day of the seventh month beginning after the date of the Participant’s separation from service or, if earlier, within fifteen days after the appointment of the personal representative or executor of the Participant’s estate following the Participant’s death.

\centered **CHANGE IN CONTROL**

^^**Impact of Change in Control.**

Upon a Change in Control, the Committee is authorized to cause (i) outstanding Options and SARs to become fully exercisable, (ii) outstanding Stock Awards to become transferable and nonforfeitable and (iii) outstanding Performance Shares and Incentive Awards to become earned and nonforfeitable in their entirety.

^^**Assumption Upon Change in Control.**

In the event of a Change in Control, the Committee, in its discretion and without the need for a Participant’s consent, may provide that an outstanding Option, SAR, Stock Award, Performance Share award or Incentive Award shall be assumed by, or a substitute award granted by, the surviving entity in the Change in Control. Such assumed or substituted award shall be of the same type of award as the original Option, SAR, Stock Award, Performance Share award or Incentive Award being assumed or substituted. The assumed or substituted award shall have a value, as of the Control Change Date, that is substantially equal to the value of the original award (or the difference between the Fair Market Value and the option price or Initial Value in the case of Options and SARs) as the Committee determines is equitably required and such other terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Committee.

^^**Cash-Out Upon Change in Control.**

In the event of a Change in Control, the Committee, in its discretion and without the need of a Participant’s consent, may provide that each Option, SAR, Stock Award and Performance Share award and Incentive Award shall be cancelled in exchange for a payment. The payment may be in cash, Common Shares or other securities or consideration received by shareholders in the Change in Control transaction. The amount of the payment shall be an amount that is substantially equal to (i) the amount by which the price per share received by shareholders in the Change in Control exceeds the option price or Initial Value in the case of an Option and SAR, or (ii) the price per share received by shareholders for each share of Common Stock subject to a Stock Award, Performance Share award or Incentive Award or (iii) the value of the other securities or property in which the Performance Share award or Inventive Award is denominated. If the option price or Initial Value exceeds the price per share received by shareholders in the Change in Control transaction, the Option or SAR may be cancelled under this Section 14.03 without any payment to the Participant.

^^**Limitation of Benefits**

The benefits that a Participant may be entitled to receive under this Plan and other benefits that a Participant is entitled to receive under other plans, agreements and arrangements (which, together with the benefits provided under this Plan, are referred to as “Payments”), may constitute Parachute Payments that are subject to Code Sections 280G and 4999. As provided in this Section 14.04, the Parachute Payments will be reduced pursuant to this Section 14.04 if, and only to the extent that, a reduction will allow a Participant to receive a greater Net After Tax Amount than a Participant would receive absent a reduction.

The Accounting Firm will first determine the amount of any Parachute Payments that are payable to a Participant. The Accounting Firm also will determine the Net After Tax Amount attributable to the Participant’s total Parachute Payments.

The Accounting Firm will next determine the largest amount of Payments that may be made to the Participant without subjecting the Participant to tax under Code Section 4999 (the “Capped Payments”). Thereafter, the Accounting Firm will determine the Net After Tax Amount attributable to the Capped Payments.

The Participant will receive the total Parachute Payments or the Capped Payments, whichever provides the Participant with the higher Net After Tax Amount. If the Participant will receive the Capped Payments, the total Parachute Payments will be adjusted by first reducing the amount of any benefits under this Plan or any other plan, agreement or arrangement that are not subject to Section 409A of the Code (with the source of the reduction to be directed by the Participant) and then by reducing the amount of any benefits under this Plan or any other plan, agreement or arrangement that are subject to Section 409A of the Code (with the source of the reduction to be directed by the Participant) in a manner that results in the best economic benefit to the Participant (or, to the extent economically equivalent, in a pro rata manner). The Accounting Firm will notify the Participant and the Company if it determines that the Parachute Payments must be reduced to the Capped Payments and will send the Participant and the Company a copy of its detailed calculations supporting that determination.

As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Code Sections 280G and 4999 at the time that the Accounting Firm makes its determinations under this Article XIV, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed to the Participant that should not have been paid or distributed under this Section 14.04 (“Overpayments”), or that additional amounts should be paid or distributed to the Participant under this Section 14.04 (“Underpayments”). If the Accounting Firm determines, based on either the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company or the Participant, which assertion the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success or controlling precedent or substantial authority, that an Overpayment has been made, the Participant must repay to the Company, without interest; provided, however, that no loan will be deemed to have been made and no amount will be payable by the Participant to the Company unless, and then only to the extent that, the deemed loan and payment would either reduce the amount on which the Participant is subject to tax under Code Section 4999 or generate a refund of tax imposed under Code Section 4999. If the Accounting Firm determines, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, that an Underpayment has occurred, the Accounting Firm will notify the Participant and the Company of that determination and the amount of that Underpayment will be paid to the Participant promptly by the Company.

For purposes of this Section 14.04, the term “Accounting Firm” means the independent accounting firm engaged by the Company immediately before the Control Change Date. For purposes of this Article XIV, the term “Net After Tax Amount” means the amount of any Parachute Payments or Capped Payments, as applicable, net of taxes imposed under Code Sections 1, 3101(b) and 4999 and any State or local income taxes applicable to the Participant on the date of payment. The determination of the Net After Tax Amount shall be made using the highest combined effective rate imposed by the foregoing taxes on income of the same character as the Parachute Payments or Capped Payments, as applicable, in effect on the date of payment. For purposes of this Section 14.04, the term “Parachute Payment” means a payment that is described in Code Section 280G(b)(2), determined in accordance with Code Section 280G and the regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 14.04, the limitations and provisions of this Section 14.04 shall not apply to any Participant who, pursuant to an agreement with the Company or the terms of another plan maintained by the Company, is entitled to indemnification for any liability that the Participant may incur under Code Section 4999. In addition, nothing in this Section 14.04 shall limit or otherwise supersede the provisions of any other agreement or plan which provides that a Participant cannot receive Payments in excess of the Capped Payments.

\centered **AMENDMENT**

The Board may amend or terminate this Plan at any time; provided, however, that no amendment may adversely impair the rights of Participants with respect to outstanding awards. In addition, an amendment will be contingent on approval of the Company’s stockholders, to the extent required by law, the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or if the amendment would increase the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan, materially increase the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan or materially modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan.

\centered **DURATION OF PLAN**

No Stock Award, Performance Share Award, Option, SAR, or Incentive Award may be granted under this Plan after [[Date 1: Date]]. Stock Awards, Performance Share Awards, Options, SARs, and Incentive Awards granted before that date shall remain valid in accordance with their terms.

\centered **EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN**

Options, SARs, Stock Awards, Performance Shares and Incentive Awards may be granted under this Plan upon its adoption by the Board; provided that, this Plan shall not be effective unless approved by a majority of the votes cast by the Company’s stockholders, voting either in person or by proxy, at a duly held stockholders’ meeting at which a stockholder quorum is present, within twelve months after the Board’s adoption of the Plan..
