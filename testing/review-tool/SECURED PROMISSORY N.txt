U.S. $[[USD Value 1: Number]]      Dated: [[Date 1: Date]]

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, **Luna Innovations Incorporated**, a Delaware corporation, and **Luna Technologies, Inc**., a Delaware corporation (individually and collectively, called the “Borrower”), HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY PROMISE TO PAY to the order of **Hansen Medical, Inc**., a Delaware corporation (the “Lender”), the principal sum of FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS (U.S. $[[USD Value 1]]), in sixteen (16) equal consecutive installments, commencing on [[Date 2: Date]], with subsequent installments payable on the last Business Day of each July, October, January and April (each a “**Payment Date**”) of each calendar year thereafter in accordance with the amortization schedule set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto, and with the last such installment to be due and payable on [[Date 3: Date]] (as the same may be accelerated as provided herein, the “**Maturity Date**”) and in the amount necessary to repay in full the unpaid principal balance hereof. 

The Borrower further promises jointly and severally, as primary obligors and not as secondary obligors, sureties, guarantors or accommodation makers, to pay interest on the outstanding principal amount of this Promissory Note (this “**Note**”) from the date hereof until the Maturity Date, at a rate per annum equal at all times to eight and one half percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date, on the date of any prepayment of the Note, and on the Maturity Date in accordance with the amortization schedule set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. 

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default hereunder, interest hereon shall accrue at a rate per annum which is [[Percentage 2: Number]]% higher than the rate of interest set forth above; provided that payment of any such interest at such rate shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default and shall be without prejudice to the right of the Lender to exercise any of its rights and remedies hereunder. All computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. 

All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America and in same day or immediately available funds, prior to 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time), to Lender into the account specified in Exhibit B, or such other account as is designated in writing by Lender to the Administrative Borrower not less than 5 Business Days prior to any date scheduled for payment hereunder. Borrower shall be entitled to pay such amounts to the last account designated by Lender (or as specified in Exhibit B if there has been no designation following the date of this Note) in the absence of any subsequent re-designation. For the purposes of this Secured Promissory Note, “**Administrative Borrower**” shall mean Luna Innovations Incorporated. 

Whenever any payment hereunder shall be due on a day other than a Business Day (as defined below), then, except as otherwise provided herein, such payment shall be made, and such interest payment date or other date shall occur, on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest hereunder. As used herein, “**Business Day**” means a day other than a Saturday or a Sunday on which banks are open for business in California and Virginia. 

The Borrower agrees to make all payments under this Note and under any Collateral Document (as defined below) without setoff or deduction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Lender receives any payment on this Note that it later has to disgorge, remit, pay over or otherwise part, such amount shall be deemed to have never been paid under this Note. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to pay the Lender interest, charges or fees at a rate in excess of the highest rate permitted by applicable law, including the Bankruptcy Code applicable pursuant to the Amended Plan of Reorganization. 

The Borrower may at any time and from time to time, prepay the outstanding amount hereof in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. Partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least $[[USD Value 2: Number]] or a greater amount which is an integral multiple of $[[USD Value 3: Number]] Prepayment may also be made under Section 4.1.4 of the Development and Supply Agreement between Borrower and Lender of even date herewith. Partial prepayments shall first be applied to the outstanding principal balance hereunder (and Exhibit A shall be amended accordingly). 

Together with any prepayment hereunder, the Borrower shall pay accrued interest to (but excluding) the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid. 

As used herein, “**GAAP**” means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States as in effect from time to time; “**Guarantor**” means any guarantor hereof; “**Guaranty**” means any guaranty hereof provided by a Guarantor; “**Indebtedness**” means any indebtedness or obligation for borrowed money, the deferred purchase price of property or leases which would be capitalized in accordance with GAAP, any reimbursement and other payment obligations in respect of letters of credit and surety or performance bonds, and all net payment obligations in respect of derivative products; and any payment liability as a surety, guarantor, accommodation party or otherwise for or upon the indebtedness or obligation of any other Person of the nature described above; “**Lien**” means any mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, security interest, charge or real estate encumbrance, lien (statutory or other), or other similar preferential arrangement (such as, any conditional sale or other title retention agreement, any financing lease having substantially the same economic effect as any of the foregoing or any agreement to give any security interest); “**Person**” means an individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, unincorporated organization or any other entity of whatever nature, including any governmental agency or authority; and “**Subsidiary**” means any corporation, association, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other business entity of which more than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the voting stock or other equity interest is owned directly or indirectly by any Person or one or more of the other Subsidiaries of such Person or a combination thereof. 

Unless otherwise defined or the context otherwise requires, all accounting terms used herein shall be construed, and all accounting determinations and computations required hereunder shall be made, in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied. 

Any of the following events which shall occur shall constitute an “**Event of Default**”: 

^The Borrower shall fail to pay when due any amount of principal or interest hereunder or other amount due and payable under this Note or any Collateral Document, and, in the case of any such non-payment, the continuation of such failure for five (5) Business days after such amount was due and payable.

^A final judgment or order for the payment of money in excess of $[[USD Value 4]] which is not fully covered by third-party insurance shall be rendered against the Borrower, or any non-monetary judgment or order shall be rendered against the Borrower, any Guarantor or any such Subsidiary which has or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and in each case there shall be any period of thirty (30) consecutive days during which such judgment continues unsatisfied or during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect.

No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Note or any other Collateral Document, nor any consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Lender and then such amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.
