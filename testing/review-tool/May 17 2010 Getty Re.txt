**Re:** **Registration Statement on Form S-3**  
Ladies and Gentlemen:  
We serve as counsel to Getty Realty Corp., a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), and have been requested to render this opinion in connection with the issuance by the Company of [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of the Company’s common stock, $[[USD Value 1: Number]] par value per share, and an additional [[Shares 2: Number]] shares which may be sold upon exercise of an option to cover over-allotments (the “Shares”), as more fully described in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File no. 333-165738) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) on [[Date 2: Date]] and amended on [[Date 3: Date]] (the “Registration Statement”), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated [[Date 4: Date]] (the “Prospectus Supplement”). The Shares are issuable pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of [[Date 4]], among the Company, and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and BofA Merrill Lynch, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as represtatives of the several underwriters listed on Schedule I attached thereto (the “Underwriting Agreement”). 

In rendering the opinion expressed herein, we have reviewed originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents (collectively, the “Documents”): 

^^The Registration Statement;  

^^The Prospectus, dated [[Date 3]], as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the General Rules and Regulations promulgated under the Securities Act; 

^^The charter of the Company, filed with State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland (the “SDAT”), as amended and supplemented to the date hereof, and as in full force and effect on the date hereof (in the form attached to the Certificate (as defined below)) (the “Charter”); 

^^The Bylaws of the Company, as in effect on the date hereof (in the form attached to the Certificate) (the “Bylaws”); 

^^Resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Registration Statement Resolutions”), relating to, among other matters, the authorization of the filing of the Registration Statement (in the form attached to the Certificate); 

^^Resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Offering Resolutions”), relating to, among other matters, the appointment of, and delegation of power to, a Pricing Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Pricing Committee”) and the sale and issuance of the Shares (in the form attached to the Certificate);

^^Resolutions adopted by the Pricing Committee (the “Pricing Committee Resolutions” and, together with the Registration Statement Resolutions and the Offering Resolutions, collectively, the “Resolutions”), relating to, among other matters, the authorization and approval of the Underwriting Agreement and the sale and issuance of the Shares (in the form attached to the Certificate); 

^^The Underwriting Agreement;  

^^A good standing certificate for the Company, dated as of [[Date 5: Date]], issued by the SDAT; and 

^^A certificate executed by the Secretary of the Company (the “Certificate”), dated as of the date hereof, as to certain factual matters. 

In examining the Documents, we have assumed, without independent investigation, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all individuals who have executed any of the aforesaid documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, and the conformity with originals of all documents submitted to us as copies (and the authenticity of the originals of such copies), the absence of other agreements or understandings among the parties that would modify the terms of the proposed transactions or the respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder and the accuracy and completeness of all public records reviewed by us. In making our examination of documents executed by parties other than the Company, we have assumed that such parties had the power and authority (corporate, trust, partnership or other) to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, and we have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action (corporate, trust, partnership or other) and the valid execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof with respect to such parties. As to any facts material to this opinion, we have relied solely upon the Certificate. 

We further assume that the issuance of the Shares will not cause any person to violate the Common Stock Ownership Limit provisions of the Charter. 

Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications stated herein, it is our opinion that: 

^The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Maryland and is in good standing with the SDAT. 

^The issuance of the Shares has been duly authorized and, when and to the extent issued in accordance with the Resolutions and the Underwriting Agreement, the Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

In addition to the qualifications set forth above, the foregoing opinion is further qualified as follows: 

^^The foregoing opinion is rendered as of the date hereof. We assume no obligation to update such opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances that may hereafter come to our attention or changes in the law which may hereafter occur.
