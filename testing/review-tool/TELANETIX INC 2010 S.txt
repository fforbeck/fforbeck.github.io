^^**Exercise of Options**. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in an Option agreement, an Option may be exercised for all, or from time to time any part, of the Shares for which it is then exercisable.

^**Other Stock-Based Awards.** Subject to the consent of Hale, the Committee may grant Awards of Shares, Awards of restricted Shares and Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on the Fair Market Value of, Shares ("Other Stock-Based Awards"). Such Other Stock-Based Awards shall vest in accordance with Section 3(b) of the Plan. Other Stock-Based Awards may be granted alone or in addition to any other Awards granted under the Plan.

^^**Change of Control**. In the event of a Change of Control after the Effective Date, the Committee may, with the consent of Hale, provide for (i) the termination of an Award upon the consummation of the Change of Control, but only if such Award has vested and been paid out or the Participant has been permitted to exercise the Award in full for a period of not less than 10 days prior to the Change of Control, (ii) acceleration of all or any portion of an Award, (iii) the payment of any amount (in cash or, in the discretion of the Committee, in the form of consideration paid to shareholders of the Company in connection with such Change of Control) in exchange for the cancellation of such Award which, in the case of Options, may equal the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Shares s ubject to such Options over the Option Price of such Options, and/or (iv) issuance of substitute Awards that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected Awards previously granted hereunder.

^**No Right to Employment or Awards**  
The granting of an Award under the Plan shall impose no obligation on the Company or any Affiliate to continue the employment or service or consulting relationship of a Participant and shall not lessen or affect the Company's or Affiliate's right to terminate the employment or service or consulting relationship of such Participant. No Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards. The terms and conditions of Awards and the Committee's determinations and interpretations with respect thereto need not be the same with respect to each Participant (whether or not such Participants are similarly situated).

^**Successors and Assigns**  
The Plan shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Company and a Participant, including without limitation, the estate of such Participant and the executor, administrator or trustee of such estate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or representative of the Participant's creditors.

^**Nontransferability of Awards**  
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, an Award shall not be transferable or assignable by the Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; provided that any transferees shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Award. An Award exercisable after the death of a Participant may be exercised by the legatees, personal representatives or distributees of the Participant.

^**Amendments or Termination**  
With the consent of Hale, the Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, but no amendment, alteration or discontinuation shall be made which (a) without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, would (except as is provided in Section 8 of the Plan), increase the total number of Shares reserved for the purposes of the Plan or change the maximum number of Shares for which Awards may be granted to any Participant or (b) without the consent of a Participant, would diminish any of the rights of the Participant under any Award theretofore granted to such Participant under the Plan; **provided**, **however**, that the Board may amend the Plan in such manner as it deems necessary to permit the granting of Awards meeting the requirements of the Code or other applicable laws.

^**Tax Withholding**.  
The Company shall have the right to make all payments or distributions pursuant to the Plan to a Participant net of any applicable federal, state and local taxes required to be paid or withheld as a result of (a) the grant of any Award, (b) the exercise of an Award, (c) the delivery of Shares or cash, (d) the lapse of any restrictions in connection with any Award or (e) any other event occurring pursuant to the Plan. The Company or any Affiliate shall have the right to withhold from wages or other amounts otherwise payable to such Participant such withholding taxes as may be required by law, or to otherwise require the Participant to pay such withholding taxes. If the Participant shall fail to make such tax payments as are required, the Company or its Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted b y law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to such Participant or to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligations. The Committee shall be authorized to establish procedures for election by Participants to satisfy such obligation for the payment of such taxes by tendering previously acquired Shares (either actually or by attestation, valued at their then Fair Market Value), or by directing the Company to retain Shares (up to the Participant's minimum required tax withholding rate or such other rate that will not trigger a negative accounting impact) otherwise deliverable in connection with the Award.

^**Compliance with Section 409A of the Code.**

This Plan is intended to comply and shall be administered in a manner that is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. To the extent that an Award or the payment, settlement or deferral thereof is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Award shall be granted, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including regulations or other guidance issued with respect thereto, except as otherwise determined by the Committee. Any provision of this Plan that would cause the grant of an Award or the payment, settlement or deferral thereof to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code shall be amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code on a timely basis, which may be made on a retroactive bas is, in accordance with regulations and other guidance issued under Section 409A of the Code.

^**Choice of Law**  
The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

^**Effectiveness of the Plan**  
The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date.
