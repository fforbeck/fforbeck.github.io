^^Procedure for Indemnification Involving Third Party Claims.

^^Within fifteen (15) days after receipt by a party indemnified under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any legal proceeding against it by a third party, such indemnified party shall, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, give notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such proceeding, which notice shall specify the nature of the claim in reasonable detail and contain copies of all correspondence and other documentation and agreements with respect to such claim. However, the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to the indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense of such action is materially prejudiced by the indemnified party’s failure to give such notice.

^^If any proceeding referred to in Section 8.3(a) is brought against an indemnified party and it gives the required notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such proceeding, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in such proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to such proceeding and the counsel chosen by the indemnifying party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity to defend such proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such proceeding), to assume the defense of such proceeding with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemn ified party of its election to assume the defense of such proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense of such proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a proceeding, (a) it will be conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (b) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified party’s consent unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or governmental requirement or any violation of the rights of any person and no adverse effect on any other claims that may be made against the indemnified party, (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying party, and (iii) the indemnified party is given a full release; and (c) the indemnifying party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to an indemnifying party of the commencement of any proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, within ten (10) days after the indemnified party’s notice is given, give notice to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such proceeding, the indemnifying party will be bound by any determination made in such proceeding or any compromise or settlement effected by the indemnified party, unless it successfully contests such liability.

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a proceeding may adversely affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such proceeding, at the indemnifying party’s expense, but the indemnifying party will not be bound by any determination of a proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).

^^Procedure for Indemnification Not Involving Third Party Claims. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim made in any legal proceeding may be asserted by written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

^^Claims in Writing. Any indemnified party shall not be entitled to recover under this Section 8 for a breach of representation, warranty or obligation, or otherwise, unless a claim has been asserted in writing, reasonably specifying the detail thereof, prior to the expiration thereof as specified in Section 8.1.

^^In the event that any provision of this Section 9 relating to time period and/or territory shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum time period and/or territory such court deems reasonable and enforceable, said time period and/or territory shall be deemed to become and thereafter be the maximum time period and/or territory which such court deems reasonable and enforceable.
