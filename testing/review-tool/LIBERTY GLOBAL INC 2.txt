^Performance Conditions For Performance Period. 

^^Except as otherwise provided in Section 7, if the Grantee receives less than a 3.0 Annual Performance Rating for any year in the Performance Period, then upon conclusion of the Company’s Annual Performance Review Process for that year, this Award and Grantee’s Target Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents shall be forfeited and the Grantee shall have no further rights hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7, if the Base Performance Objective is not met, this Award and Grantee’s Target Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents shall be forfeited and the Grantee shall have no further rights hereunder. 

^^The Base Performance Objective and Performance Metric or Performance Metrics established by the Committee for the Performance Period are set forth on **Appendix A** attached hereto and made a part hereof for all purposes. If the Grantee is not an executive officer of the Company as of the last day of the Performance Period and is not reasonably anticipated to be an NEO as of the last day of the following calendar year, the Earned Performance Share Units for the Grantee shall initially be determined by multiplying the number of Target Performance Share Units by the Earned Percentage determined by the Committee in accordance with **Appendix A**. If the Grantee is an executive officer of the Company as of the last day of the Performance Period or is reasonably anticipated to be an NEO as of the last day of the following calendar year, then the Earned Performance Share Units for the Grantee shall initially be determined by multiplying the number of Target Performance Share Units by the Maximum Percentage, subject to reduction to such lower number as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion, but, except as provided in the following sentence, not below the number determined by multiplying the number of Grantee’s Target Performance Share Units by the Earned Percentage determined by the Committee in accordance with **Appendix A**. If the Grantee received at least a 3.0 but less than a 4.0 Annual Performance Rating for any year in the Performance Period, then the Committee may in its discretion reduce the number of Earned Performance Share Units initially so determined in accordance with the applicable of the preceding two sentences to such number of Earned Performance Share Units as the Committee shall determine. 

^^Following the close of the Performance Period, the Committee shall certify whether the Base Performance Objective has been met and the extent to which the Performance Metric or Performance Metrics have been achieved and the calculation of the Earned Percentage in the manner required for qualified performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and the Regulations. The Committee may, but shall not be obligated to, engage an independent accounting firm to perform agreed upon procedures to verify the calculations. Upon completing its determination, the Committee shall notify the Grantee, in the form and manner as determined by the Committee, of the number of Earned Performance Share Units that will be subject to the service vesting provisions of Section 4. 

^^If the number of Grantee’s Earned Performance Share Units is less than the number of Grantee’s Target Performance Share Units, the excess Target Performance Share Units and any related unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will immediately be cancelled. If the number of Grantee’s Earned Performance Share Units exceeds the number of Grantee’s Target Performance Units, Grantee will be awarded a number of additional Performance Share Units so that the number of Grantee’s Target Performance Share Units and such additional Performance Share Units will equal the number of Grantee’s Earned Performance Share Units. 

^Vesting during Service Period. 

^^Unless the Committee otherwise determines in its sole discretion, subject to earlier vesting in accordance with Section 5, 6 or 7 of this Agreement or Section 11.1(b) of the Plan and subject to the forfeiture provisions of this Agreement, the Earned Performance Share Units shall become vested in accordance with the following schedule (each date specified below being a Vesting Date): 

^^^On [[Date 5: Date]] during the Service Period, [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the Earned Performance Share Units shall become vested; and

^^^On [[Date 4]] during the Service Period, [[Percentage 2]]% of the Earned Performance Share Units shall become vested.

**[Please refer to the website of the Third Party Administrator, UBS Financial Services Inc., which maintains the database for the Plan and provides related services, for the specific Vesting Dates related to the Performance Share Units (click on the specific grant under the tab labeled “Grants/Award/Units”).]** 

^^On each Vesting Date, subject to the satisfaction of any other applicable restrictions, terms and conditions, any RSU Dividend Equivalents with respect to the Earned Performance Share Units that have not theretofore become Vested RSU Dividend Equivalents (“Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents”) will become vested to the extent that the Earned Performance Share Units related thereto shall have become vested in accordance with this Agreement. 

^Termination, Death or Disability during Performance Period. 

Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 5 and to Sections 7 and 8, in the event of Termination of Service at any time during the Performance Period, the Grantee shall thereupon forfeit the Grantee’s Target Performance Share Units, any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents and any rights hereunder, except as indicated below: 

^^If the Termination of Service occurs after [[Date 6: Date]] of the first year of the Performance Period and is due to death, then provided that the Grantee’s Annual Performance Rating for any full year, if any, of the Performance Period prior to Termination of Service was not less than 3.0, the Grantee’s estate will be entitled to a prorated portion of the Grantee’s Target Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents based on the number of full days of service by the Grantee during the Performance Period. Subject to the foregoing, the prorated portion of the Target Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalent will thereupon become vested and will be settled in accordance with Section 9 as soon as administratively practicable after the Termination of Service, but in no event later than [[Date 3]] of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Termination of Service occurred. 

^^If the Termination of Service occurs after [[Date 6]] of the first year of the Performance Period and is due to Disability, then provided that the Grantee’s most recent Annual Performance Rating prior to Termination of Service was not less than 3.0, the Grantee will retain the right to earn a pro rata portion of the Grantee’s Target Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents. The number of the Grantee’s Earned Performance Share Units will initially be determined in accordance with Section 3 on the same basis as would otherwise apply had no Termination of Service occurred, but if the Termination of Service occurs in the first year of the Performance Period, the level of achievement of the Performance Metric or Performance Metrics will be determined based on the Company’s relative performance during that year as if the Performance Period were one year.The number of Earned Performance Share Units so determined will then be prorated based on the number of full days of service by the Grantee during the full Performance Period. Subject to the foregoing, the prorated portion of the Earned Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will thereupon become vested and will be settled in accordance with Section 9 as soon as administratively practicable after the Termination of Service, but in no event later than [[Date 3]] of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which Grantee’s Termination of Service occurred. 

^^If the Termination of Service occurs after [[Date 6]] of the first year of the Performance Period and is due to termination of the Grantee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without Cause or resignation by the Grantee for Good Reason, then the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that a portion of the Grantee’s Earned Performance Share Units (determined in the manner described in Section 5(b)) and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will thereupon become vested and no longer be subject to a risk of forfeiture in such amount as the Committee may determine, and shall be settled in accordance with Section 9 as soon as administratively practicable after the Termination of Service, but in no event later than [[Date 3]] of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Termination of Service occurred, provided that in no event shall the amount or terms of such settlement be more favorable to the Grantee than if the Grantee’s service had terminated due to Disability. 

^Termination, Death or Disability during Service Period. 

Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 6 and to Sections 7 and 8, in the event of Termination of Service at any time during the Service Period, the Grantee shall, effective upon such Termination of Service, forfeit any Earned Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents, the Vesting Date for which has not yet occurred, except as indicated below: 

^^If the Termination of Service is due to death or Disability, the Grantee’s unvested Earned Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will thereupon become vested and no longer be subject to a risk of forfeiture. Such Earned Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will be settled in accordance with Section 9 as of the originally scheduled Vesting Dates. 

^^If the Termination of Service is due to termination of the Grantee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without Cause or resignation by the Grantee for Good Reason, then the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that a portion of the Grantee’s Earned Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will become vested and no longer be subject to a risk of forfeiture in such amount as the Committee may determine, and shall be settled in accordance with Section 9 as of the originally scheduled Vesting Dates, provided that in no event shall the amount or terms of such settlement be more favorable to the Grantee than if the Grantee’s service had terminated due to death or Disability. 

^Change in Control. 

^^If an Approved Transaction, Board Change or Control Purchase occurs on or before the Grantee’s Termination of Service and (x) this Agreement is not continued on the same terms and conditions or (y) in the case of an Approved Transaction, the Committee as constituted prior to such Approved Transaction has not determined, in its discretion, that effective provision has been made for the assumption or continuation of this Agreement on terms and conditions that in the opinion of the Committee are as nearly as practicable equivalent for the Grantee to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, taking into account, to the extent applicable, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets into or for which the LBTY. may be changed, converted or exchanged in connection with the Approved Transaction, then the provisions of this Section 7(a) will apply, subject to Section 8: 

^^^If the Approved Transaction, Board Change or Control Purchase occurs during the Performance Period, then provided that the Grantee’s Annual Performance Rating for any full year, if any, of the Performance Period prior to such event was not less than 3.0, the Grantee will be deemed to have earned a number of Earned Performance Share Units equal to the Grantee’s Target Performance Share Units. Such Earned Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents shall thereupon become vested and will be settled in accordance with Section 9 promptly following the occurrence of the Board Change or Control Purchase, but in any event no later than 30 days following such occurrence, or immediately prior to consummation of the Approved Transaction. The accelerated vesting and settlement contemplated by this clause (i) will be in full satisfaction of the Grantee’s rights hereunder. 

^^^If the Approved Transaction, Board Change or Control Purchase occurs during the Service Period, the Grantee’s remaining Earned Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will vest and no longer be subject to a risk of forfeiture upon the occurrence of the Board Change or Control Purchase or immediately prior to consummation of the Approved Transaction. Such Earned Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents shall be settled in accordance with Section 9 promptly following the occurrence of the Board Change or Control Purchase, but in any event no later than 30 days following such occurrence, or immediately prior to consummation of the Approved Transaction. The accelerated vesting and settlement contemplated by this clause (ii) will be in full satisfaction of the Grantee’s rights hereunder. 

^^If an Approved Transaction, Board Change or Control Purchase occurs on or before the Grantee’s Termination of Service and the provisions of Section 7(a) do not apply because of the assumption or continuation of this Agreement as described therein, then the following will apply, subject to Section 8: 

^^^If the Approved Transaction, Board Change or Control Purchase occurs during the Performance Period, then provided that the Grantee’s Annual Performance Rating for any full year, if any, of the Performance Period prior to such event was not less than 3.0, the Grantee will thereupon be deemed to have earned a number of Earned Performance Share Units equal to the Grantee’s Target Performance Share Units, and the Grantee shall continue to be subject to the service and vesting requirements of, and to have the rights otherwise provided under, this Agreement with respect to such Earned Performance Share Units. 

^^^If the Approved Transaction, Board Change or Control Purchase occurs during the Service Period, the Grantee will continue to have the rights otherwise provided under this Agreement with respect to the Earned Performance Share Units. 

^^^In the event of Termination of Service thereafter due to termination of the Grantee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Cause or resignation by the Grantee, but excluding resignation as a result of Disability or for Good Reason, the Grantee shall, effective upon such Termination of Service, forfeit any then unvested Earned Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents, the Vesting Date for which has not yet occurred. 

^^^In the event of Termination of Service thereafter due to death or Disability, resignation by the Grantee for Good Reason or termination by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without Cause, then effective upon such Termination of Service, the Grantee’s then unvested Earned Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalent shall become vested and no longer subject to a risk of forfeiture. Settlement in accordance with Section 9 of such Earned Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will be made, (x) if the Termination of Service occurs during the Performance Period, as soon as administratively practicable after the Termination of Service, but in no event later than [[Date 3]] of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Termination of Service occurred, and (y) if the Termination of Service occurs during the Service Period, as of the originally scheduled Vesting Dates. 

^Forfeiture and Recoupment Policy. 

^^Except when the Grantee’s Termination of Service is due to death or Disability, the accelerated vesting of Performance Share Units contemplated or permitted by Sections 5 and 6 shall be contingent upon execution by the Grantee, no later than the 60th day after the Termination of Service, of a general release, non-solicitation agreement and confidentiality agreement and, if the Committee in its discretion so requires, a non-competition agreement, in each case in favor of the Company and its Subsidiaries and in substance and form approved by the Committee, which form shall be provided by the Company to the Grantee within 15 days after the Termination of Service. 

^^If the Grantee breaches any restrictions, terms or conditions provided in or established by the Committee pursuant to the Plan or this Agreement with respect to the Performance Share Units prior to the vesting thereof (including any attempted or completed transfer of any such unvested Performance Share Units contrary to the terms of the Plan or this Agreement), the unvested Performance Share Units, together with any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents, will be forfeited immediately. 

^^If the Company’s consolidated financial statements for any of the years taken into account in the Performance Metrics are required to be restated at any time as a result of an error (whether or not involving fraud or misconduct) and the Committee determines that if the financial results had been properly reported the number of Earned Performance Share Units would have been lower, then the Grantee shall be required to forfeit the excess amount of his or her Earned Performance Share Units, together with any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents, or to refund any amounts previously delivered to the Grantee.

The Grantee will have no right to receive, or otherwise with respect to, any RSU Dividend Equivalents until such time, if ever, as the Performance Share Units with respect to which such RSU Dividend Equivalents relate shall have become vested and, if vesting does not occur, the related RSU Dividend Equivalents will be forfeited. RSU Dividend Equivalents shall not bear interest or be segregated in a separate account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting of any portion of the RSU Dividend Equivalents (the “Vested RSU Dividend Equivalents”).

Any delivery of securities will be deemed effected for all purposes when (1) a certificate representing or statement of holdings reflecting such securities and, in the case of any Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents, any other documents necessary to reflect ownership thereof by the Grantee has been delivered personally to the Grantee or, if delivery is by mail, when the Company or its stock transfer agent has deposited the certificate or statement of holdings and/or such other documents in the United States mail, addressed to the Grantee, or (2) confirmation of deposit into the designated broker’s account of such securities, in written or electronic format, is first made available to the Grantee. Any cash payment will be deemed effected when a check from the Company, payable to or at the direction of the Grantee and in the amount equal to the amount of the cash payment, has been delivered personally to or at the direction of the Grantee or deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the Grantee or his or her nominee. 

^Nontransferability of Performance Share Units Before Vesting. 

^^Before vesting and during the Grantee’s lifetime, the Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents may not be sold, assigned, transferred by gift or otherwise, pledged, exchanged, encumbered or disposed of (voluntarily or involuntarily), other than an assignment pursuant to a Domestic Relations Order.

^^The Grantee may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the Performance Share Units, to the extent then vesting, and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will pass upon the Grantee’s death and may change such designation from time to time by filing a written designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries with the Committee on such form as may be prescribed by the Committee, provided that no such designation will be effective unless so filed prior to the death of the Grantee. If no such designation is made or if the designated beneficiary does not survive the Grantee’s death, the Performance Share Units, to the extent then vesting, and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Following the Grantee’s death, the person to whom such vested Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents pass according to the foregoing will be deemed the Grantee for purposes of any applicable provisions of this Agreement.

^Adjustments. The Performance Share Units and any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Plan in such manner as the Committee may deem equitable and appropriate in connection with the occurrence following the Grant Date of any of the events described in Section 4.2 of the Plan.

Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan will be construed to give the Grantee any right to be granted any future Award other than in the sole discretion of the Committee or give the Grantee or any other person any interest in any fund or in any specified asset or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Grantee nor any person claiming through the Grantee will have any right or interest in shares of LBTY. represented by any Performance Share Units or any related Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents unless and until there shall have been full compliance with all the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement and the Plan which affect the Grantee or such other person. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the transfer by Grantee of shares of LBTY. received upon vesting of Performance Share Units shall be subject to Grantee’s compliance with the Company’s Executive Stock Ownership Policy, as in effect from time to time. 

^Restrictions Imposed by Law. Without limiting the generality of Section 11.8 of the Plan, the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of LBTY. represented by vested Performance Share Units or securities constituting any Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents if counsel to the Company determines that the issuance or delivery thereof would violate any applicable law or any rule or regulation of any governmental authority or any rule or regulation of, or agreement of the Company with, any securities exchange upon which shares of LBTY. or such other securities are listed. The Company will in no event be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the delivery of shares of LBTY. represented by vested Performance Share Units or securities constituting any Unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents to comply with any such law, rule, regulation, or agreement. Any certificates representing any such securities issued or delivered under this Agreement may bear such legend or legends as the Company deems appropriate in order to assure compliance with applicable securities laws. 

^Taxes. 

^^To the extent that the Company is subject to withholding tax requirements under any national, state, local or other governmental law with respect to the award of the Performance Share Units to the Grantee or the vesting thereof, or the designation of any RSU Dividend Equivalents as payable or distributable or the payment or distribution thereof, the Grantee must make arrangement satisfactory to the Company to make payment to the Company of the amount required to be withheld under such tax laws, as determined by the Company (collectively, the “Required Withholding Amount”). To the extent such withholding is required because the Grantee vests in some or all of the Performance Share Units and any related RSU Dividend Equivalents, the Company shall withhold (i) from the shares of LBTY. represented by vested Performance Share Units and otherwise deliverable to the Grantee a number of shares of LBTY. and/or (ii) from any related RSU Dividend Equivalents otherwise deliverable to the Grantee an amount of such RSU Dividend Equivalents, which collectively have a value (or, in the case of securities withheld, a Fair Market Value) equal to the Required Withholding Amount. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the delivery of any shares of LBTY. represented by vested Performance Share Units and any related RSU Dividend Equivalents may be postponed until any required withholding taxes have been paid to the Company. 

^^At all times prior to the Vesting Date, the benefit payable under this Agreement is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Section 409A and Regulation 1.409A-1(d) (or any successor Regulation). Accordingly, this Agreement is not subject to Section 409A under the short term deferral exclusion. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Agreement, if Grantee is a “specified employee” as such term is defined in Section 409A, and determined as described below, any amounts that would otherwise be payable hereunder as nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A on account of Termination of Service (other than by reason of death) to the Grantee shall not be payable before the earlier of (i) the date that is six months after the date of the Grantee’s Termination of Service, (ii) the date of the Grantee’s death or (iii) the date that otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 409A. The Grantee shall be deemed a “specified employee” for the twelve-month period beginning on [[Date 7: Date]] of a year if the Grantee is a “key employee” as defined in Section 416(i) of the Code (without regard to Section 416(i)(5)) as of [[Date 8: Date]] of the preceding year. 

^^Except as provided in Section 17(d) or 17(e), in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement (“Payment”), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest or penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Excise Tax”), then the amount of “parachute payments” (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) payable or required to be provided to the Grantee under this Agreement shall be automatically reduced (a “Reduction”) to the minimum extent necessary to avoid imposition of such Excise Tax. 

^^Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if a Reduction under Section 17(c) of the amount payable under this Agreement and any similar reduction made pursuant to the terms of any other award of Restricted Shares under the Plan or any similar incentive plan adopted by the Company would result in the amount of parachute payments being reduced by twenty percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) or more of the aggregate parachute payments made to the Grantee under this Agreement and any such other arrangement, then no Reduction shall apply and the Grantee shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a “Gross-Up Payment”) in an amount such that, after payment (whether through withholding at the source or otherwise) by the Grantee of all federal, state or local taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto), employment taxes and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Grantee retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed on the Payment. Any Gross-up Payment shall be made by the end of the Company’s taxable year next following the Grantee’s taxable year in which the Grantee pays the Excise Tax. For purposes of determining the Excise Tax attributable to the Payment, no portion of the “base amount” (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be deemed to be allocable to the Payment so as to reduce the amount of the Gross-Up Payment. All determinations required to be made under this Section 17(d) shall be made by the Company’s accounting firm (the “Accounting Firm”). The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Grantee. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Absent manifest error, any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Grantee. 

^^In the event the Grantee is a party to or participant in any other plan or arrangement that provides for a gross-up payment to mitigate the impact of the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax, then (i) the provisions of Section 17(c) above shall be applied without taking into account any parachute payments payable under such plan or arrangement, and (ii) the provisions of Section 17(d) above shall apply without reference to the amount of any gross-up payment made to the Grantee pursuant to that plan or arrangement.

Unless the Company notifies the Grantee in writing of a different procedure, any notice or other communication to the Company with respect to this Agreement will be in writing and will be delivered personally or sent by United States first class mail, postage prepaid, sent by overnight courier, freight prepaid or sent by facsimile and addressed as follows:

^^subject to any required action by the Board or the stockholders of the Company, the Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be canceled by the Company and a new Award made in substitution therefor, provided that the Award so substituted will satisfy all of the requirements of the Plan as of the date such new Award is made and no such action will adversely affect any Performance Share Units that are then vested. 

^Grantee Employment or Service. 

^^Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action of the Company or the Committee with respect hereto, will confer or be construed to confer on the Grantee any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or interfere in any way with any right of the Company or any Subsidiary, subject to the terms of any separate employment or service agreement to the contrary, to terminate the Grantee’s employment or service at any time, with or without cause, or to increase or decrease the Grantee’s compensation from the rate in effect at the date hereof or to change the Grantee’s title or duties. 

^^The Award hereunder is special incentive compensation that will not be taken into account, in any manner, as salary, earnings, compensation, bonus or benefits, in determining the amount of any payment under any pension, retirement, profit sharing, 401(k), life insurance, salary continuation, severance or other employee benefit plan, program or policy of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any employment or service agreement or arrangement with the Grantee. 

^^It is a condition of the Grantee’s Award that, in the event of Termination of Service for whatever reason, whether lawful or not, including in circumstances which could give rise to a claim for wrongful and/or unfair dismissal (whether or not it is known at the time of Termination of Service that such a claim may ensue), the Grantee will not by virtue of such Termination of Service, subject to Sections 5, 6 and 7 of this Agreement, become entitled to any damages or severance or any additional amount of damages or severance in respect of any rights or expectations of whatsoever nature the Grantee may have hereunder or under the Plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, the Award hereunder will not form part of the Grantee’s entitlement to remuneration or benefits pursuant to the Grantee’s employment or service agreement or arrangement, if any. The rights and obligations of the Grantee under the terms of his or her employment or service agreement, if any, will not be enhanced hereby. 

^^In the event of any inconsistency between the terms hereof or of the Plan and any employment, severance or other agreement with the Grantee, the terms hereof and of the Plan shall control. 

^Nonalienation of Benefits. Except as provided in Section 12 of this Agreement, (i) no right or benefit under this Agreement will be subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, hypothecation, pledge, exchange, transfer, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, hypothecate, pledge, exchange, transfer, encumber or charge the same will be void, and (ii) no right or benefit hereunder will in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of the Grantee or other person entitled to such benefits. 

^Data Privacy. 

^^The Grantee’s acceptance hereof shall evidence the Grantee’s explicit and unambiguous consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Grantee’s personal data by and among, as applicable, the Grantee’s employer (the “Employer”) and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Grantee’s participation in the Plan.
