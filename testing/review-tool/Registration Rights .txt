^Registration Under the Securities Act.

^^The Company and the Guarantors agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause a registration statement (the “Exchange Offer Registration Statement”) to become or be declared effective on or prior to 360 days after the closing date, relating to an offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”) any and all of the Securities for a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities issued by the Company and guaranteed by the Guarantors, which debt securities and guarantees are substantially identical to the Securities and the related Guarantees, respectively (and are entitled to the benefits of the Indenture), except that they have been registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and do not contain provisions for Special Interest contemplated in Section 2(c) below (such new debt securities hereinafter called “Exchange Securities”). The Exchange Offer will be registered under the Securities Act on the appropriate form and will comply with all applicable tender offer rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. Unless the Exchange Offer would not be permitted by applicable law or Commission policy, the Company further agrees to (i) commence the Exchange Offer promptly (but no later than 10 Business Days) following the Effective Time of such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, (ii) use all commercially reasonable efforts to hold the Exchange Offer open for at least 20 Business Days in accordance with Regulation 14E promulgated by the Commission under the Exchange Act and (iii) use all commercially reasonable efforts to exchange Exchange Securities for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn promptly following the expiration of the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer will be deemed to have been “completed” only (i) upon the delivery by the Company to the Trustee under the Indenture of Exchange Securities in the same aggregate principal amount as the aggregate principal amount of Registrable Securities that were tendered by holders thereof pursuant to the Exchange Offer, and (ii) upon the Company having exchanged, pursuant to the Exchange Offer, Exchange Securities for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the Exchange Offer, which shall be on a date that is at least 20 Business Days and not more than 30 Business Days following the commencement of the Exchange Offer. The Company and the Guarantors agree (x) to include in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement a prospectus for use in any resales by any holder of Exchange Securities that is a broker-dealer and (y) to keep such Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective for a period (the “Resale Period”) beginning when Exchange Securities are first issued in the Exchange Offer and ending upon the earlier of the expiration of the 180th day after the Exchange Offer has been completed or such time as such broker-dealers are no longer required to deliver a prospectus in connection with market making or other trading activities. With respect to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, such holders shall have the benefit of the rights of indemnification and contribution set forth in Subsections 6(a), (c), (d) and (e).

^^If (i) the Company and the Guarantors are not required to file the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, (ii) the Company and the Guarantors are not permitted to consummate the Exchange Offer because the Exchange Offer is not permitted by applicable law or Commission policy or (iii) any holder of Registrable Securities notifies the Company prior to the 20th Business Day following the completion of the Exchange Offer that: (A) it is prohibited by law or Commission policy from participating in the Exchange Offer, (B) it may not resell the Exchange Securities to the public without delivering a prospectus and the prospectus supplement contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not appropriate or available for such resales or (C) it is a broker-dealer and owns Securities acquired directly from the Company or an affiliate of the Company, then the Company and the Guarantors shall, in lieu of (or, in the case of clause (iii), in addition to) conducting the Exchange Offer contemplated by Section 2(a), use all commercially reasonable efforts to file under the Securities Act on or prior to 30 days after the time such obligation to file arises (but no earlier than 90 days after the Closing Date), a “shelf” registration statement (which may be an amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) providing for the registration of, and the sale on a continuous or delayed basis by the holders of, all of the Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission (such filing, the “Shelf Registration” and such registration statement, the “Shelf Registration Statement”). The Company and the Guarantors agreeto use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared effective on or prior to 90 days after such Shelf Registration Statement filing obligation arises. The Company and the Guarantors agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective for a period ending on the earlier of the second anniversary of the Effective Time or such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding. No holder shall be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities unless such holder is an Electing Holder. The Company and the Guarantors agree, after the Effective Time of the Shelf Registration Statement and promptly upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities that is not then an Electing Holder, to use commercially reasonable efforts to enable such holder to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, any action necessary to identify such holder as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement (whether by post-effective amendment thereto or by filing a prospectus pursuant to Rules 430B and 424(b) under the Securities Act identifying such holder), provided, however, that nothing in this sentence shall relieve any such holder of the obligation to return a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to the Company in accordance with Section 3(d)(iii). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2(b), upon notice to the Electing Holders, the Company may suspend the use or the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement, or extend the time period in which it is required to file the Shelf Registration Statement, for a reasonable period of time but not in excess of 60 consecutive days and not more than three (3) times during any 12-month period (a “Suspension Period”) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines that there is a valid business purpose for suspension of the Shelf Registration Statement; provided that the Company shall promptly notify the Electing Holders when the Shelf Registration Statement may once again be used or is effective.

^^In the event that (i) Exchange Offer Registration Statement has not been declared effective within 360 days after the closing date or Shelf Registration Statement has not become effective or been declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the Effective Time for such registration statement or (ii) the Exchange Offer has not been completed within 30 Business Days after the Effective Time of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement relating to the Exchange Offer (if the Exchange Offer is then required to be made) or (iii) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement required by Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) is declared effective but shall thereafter either be withdrawn by the Company or shall become subject to an effective stop order issued pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement (except as specifically permitted herein, including, with respect to any Shelf Registration Statement, during any applicable Suspension Period in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2(b)) without being succeeded immediately by an additional registration statement filed and declared effective (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iii), a “Registration Default” and each period during which a Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, a “Registration Default Period”), then, as liquidated damages for such Registration Default, subject to the provisions of Section 9(b), special interest (“Special Interest”), in addition to the Base Interest, shall accrue on the principal amount of all Registrable Securities then outstanding at a per annum rate of [[Percentage 1: Number]]% for the first 90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a per annum rate of [[Percentage 2: Number]]% for the second 90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a per annum rate of [[Percentage 3: Number]]% for the third 90 days of the Registration Default Period and at a per annum rate of [[Percentage 4: Number]]% thereafter for the remaining portion of the Registration Default Period. For the avoidance of doubts, in no event shall Special Interest exceed [[Percentage 4]]% per annum. Following the cure of all Registration Defaults, the interest rate borne by the Registrable Securities will revert to Base Interest. All accrued Special Interest shall be paid by the Company and the Guarantors to the holders entitled thereto on the next scheduled interest payment date to DTC or its nominee by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by federal funds check and to holders of Certificated Notes by wire transfer to the accounts specified by them or by mailing checks to their registered address if no such accounts have been specified.

^^The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, and shall cause the Guarantors to use all commercially reasonable efforts to take,all actions necessary or advisable to be taken by it to ensure that the transactions contemplated herein are effected as so contemplated, including all actions necessary or desirable to register the Guarantee under any Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, as applicable.

^^Any reference herein to a registration statement or prospectus as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time; and any reference herein to any post-effective amendment to a registration statement or to any prospectus supplement as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time.

^^Any documents incorporated by reference in any prospectus referred to in Section 5(a), when they become or became effective or are or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform or conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and none of such documents will contain or contained an untrue statement of a material fact or will omit or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a holder of Registrable Securities expressly for use therein.

^^The compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not (i) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, except for any such breach, default, violation or event that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) result in any violation of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, as amended, or the by-laws or other governing documents, as applicable, of the Companyor the Guarantors or (iii) result in any violation of any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties except for any such breach or violation that would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material Adverse Effect; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation by the Company and the Guarantors of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (x) the registration under the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities, the Securities and the Exchange Securities, as applicable, and qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, (y) such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws in connection with the offering and distribution of the Registrable Securities, the Securities and the Exchange Securities, as applicable, and (z) such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications that have been obtained and are in full force and effect as of the date hereof.

^Indemnification and Contribution.  
^^Indemnification by the Company and the Guarantors. The Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each of the holders of Registrable Securities included in an Exchange Offer Registration Statement and each of the Electing Holders as holders of Registrable Securities included in a Shelf Registration Statement against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such holder or such Electing Holder may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Exchange Offer Registration Statement or any Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, under which such Registrable Securities, Securities or Exchange Securities were registered under the Securities Act, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus (including, without limitation, any “issuer free writing prospectus” as defined in Rule 433) contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such holder or any such Electing Holder, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such holder and each such Electing Holder for any and all legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Guarantors shallbe liable to any such person in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, or preliminary, final or summary prospectus (including, without limitation, any “issuer free writing prospectus” as defined in Rule 433), or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such person expressly for use therein.

^^Indemnification by the Electing Holders. The Company may require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2(b), that the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from each Electing Holder of Registrable Securities included in such Shelf Registration Statement, severally and not jointly, to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors and all other Electing Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Shelf Registration Statement, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company, the Guarantors or such other Electing Holders may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus (including, without limitation, any “issuer free writing prospectus” as defined in Rule 433) contained therein or furnished by the Company to any Electing Holder, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Electing Holder expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company and the Guarantors for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and the Guarantors in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that no such Electing Holder shall be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 6(b) for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Electing Holder from the sale of such Electing Holder’s Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration.

^^Notices of Claims, Etc. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b). In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

^^Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no Electing Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (**before** deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The holders’ obligations in this Section 6(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered by them and not joint.

^^The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantors may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder, each Electing Holder, and each person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders and the Electing Holders contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder or Electing Holder may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or the Guarantors (including any person who, with his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a director of the Company or the Guarantors) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, as well as to each officer and director of the other holders and to each person, if any, who controls such other holders within the meaning of the Securities Act.

^Underwritten Offerings.  
Each holder of Registrable Securities hereby agrees with the Company and each other such holder that no holder of Registrable Securities may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless (a) the Company gives its prior written consent to such underwritten offering, (b) the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof shall be designated by Electing Holders holding at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering, provided that such designated managing underwriter or underwriters is or are reasonably acceptable to the Company, (c) each holder of Registrable Securities participating in such underwritten offering agrees to sell such holder’s Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled selecting the managing underwriter or underwriters hereunder and (d) each holder of Registrable Securities participating in such underwritten offering completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

^Rule 144.  
^^Facilitation of Sales Pursuant to Rule 144. The Company covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities that to the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144), and shall make available to any holder of Registrable Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of Registrable Securities from such holder, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

^^Availability of Rule 144 Not Excuse for Obligations under Section 2. The fact that holders of Registrable Securities may become eligible to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144 shall not (1) cause such Securities to cease to be Registrable Securities or (2) excuse the Company’s and the Guarantors’ obligations set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement, including without limitation the obligations in respect of an Exchange Offer, Shelf Registration and Special Interest.

^Miscellaneous.  
^^No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that it has not granted, and shall not grant, registration rights with respect to Registrable Securities, Exchange Securities or Securities, as applicable, or any other securities which would be inconsistent with the terms contained in this Agreement.

^^Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge that there would be no adequate remedy at law if the Company fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder and that the Purchasers and the holders from time to time of the Registrable Securities may be irreparably harmed by any such failure, and accordingly agree that the Purchasers and such holders, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, shall be entitled to compel specific performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in any court of the United States or any State thereof having jurisdiction. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.

^^Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered by hand, if delivered personally, by facsimile or by courier, or three days after being deposited in the mail (registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested) as follows: If to the Company, to it at[[Address 2: Address]], and if to a holder, to the address of such holder set forth in the security register or other records of the Company, or to such other address as the Company or any such holder may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notices of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.

^^Parties in Interest. All the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto, the holders from time to time of the Registrable Securities and the respective successors and assigns of the foregoing. In the event that any transferee of any holder of Registrable Securities shall acquire Registrable Securities, in any manner, whether by gift, bequest, purchase, operation of law or otherwise, such transferee shall, without any further writing or action of any kind, be deemed a beneficiary hereof for all purposes and such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such transferee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of, and be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by all of the applicable terms and provisions of this Agreement. If the Company shall so request, any such successor, assign or transferee shall agree in writing to acquire and hold the Registrable Securities subject to all of the applicable terms hereof.

^^Survival. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and each other provision set forth in this Agreement or made pursuant hereto shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation (or statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any holder of Registrable Securities, any director, officer or partner of such holder, or any controlling person of any of the foregoing, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the transfer and registration of Registrable Securities by such holder and the consummation of an Exchange Offer.

^^***Governing Law.*** **This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.**

^^Headings. The descriptive headings of the several Sections and paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

^^Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement and the other writings referred to herein (including the Indenture and the form of Securities) or delivered pursuant hereto which form a part hereof contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may be amended and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a written instrument duly executed by the Company and the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities at the time outstanding. Each holder of any Registrable Securities at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by any amendment or waiver effected pursuant to this Section 9(h), whether or not any notice, writing or marking indicating such amendment or waiver appears on such Registrable Securities or is delivered to such holder.

^^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

^^Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions contained in this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby.

^^Set forth below is Interpretation A.65 of the Commission’s [[Date 3: Date]] Manual of Publicly Available Interpretations regarding short selling:

“An issuer filed a Form S-3 registration statement for a secondary offering of common stock which is not yet effective. One of the selling shareholders wanted to do a short sale of common stock “against the box” and cover the short sale with registered shares after the effective date. The issuer was advised that the short sale could not be made before the registration statement becomes effective, because the shares underlying the short sale are deemed to be sold at the time such sale is made. There would, therefore, be a violation of Section 5 if the shares were effectively sold prior to the effective date.”
