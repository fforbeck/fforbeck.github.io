The Impositions shall be paid not later than the dates on which the particular Imposition would become delinquent and Affiliated Guarantor shall produce to Lender receipts of the imposing authority, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender, evidencing the payment of the Imposition in full. If Affiliated Guarantor and/or Operating Lessee, as applicable, elects by appropriate legal action to contest any Imposition, Affiliated Guarantor shall first deposit cash (or other security approved by Lender such as a bond or letter of credit) with Lender as a reserve in an amount which Lender determines is sufficient to pay the Imposition plus all fines, interest, penalties and costs which may become due pending the determination of the contest.

^^In the event of the passage, after the Execution Date, of any law which deducts from the value of the Property, for the purposes of taxation, any lien or security interest encumbering the Property, or changing in any way the existing laws regarding the taxation of mortgages, deeds of trust and/or security agreements or debts secured by these instruments, or changing the manner for the collection of any such taxes, and the law has the effect of imposing payment of any Impositions upon Lender, at Lender’s option, the Guaranteed Obligations may be declared by Lender to immediately become due and payable. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Lender’s election to accelerate the Loan shall not be effective if (1) Affiliated Guarantor and/or Operating Lessee as applicable is permitted by law (including, without limitation, applicable interest rate laws) to, and actually does, pay the Imposition or the increased portion of the Imposition and (2) Affiliated Guarantor agrees in writing to pay or reimburse Lender in accordance with Section 11.6 for the payment of any such Imposition which becomes payable at any time when the Affiliated Guaranty is outstanding. 

^ESCROW DEPOSITS. 

^^Without limiting the effect of Section 2.4 and Section 3.1, subject to (b) and (c) below, Affiliated Guarantor shall pay to Lender monthly on the same date the monthly installment is payable under the Note, an amount equal to 1/12th of the amounts Lender reasonably estimates are necessary to pay, on an annualized basis, (1) all Impositions and (2) the premiums for the insurance policies required under this Mortgage (collectively the “Premiums”) until such time as Affiliated Guarantor has deposited an amount equal to the annual charges for these items and on demand, from time to time, shall pay to Lender any additional amounts necessary to pay the Premiums and Impositions. Affiliated Guarantor will furnish to Lender bills for Impositions and Premiums thirty (30) days before Impositions become delinquent and such Premiums become due for payment.

In the event any of these events described in clauses (a) through (d) occur, unless Lender agrees to an alternative arrangement directly with the independent third party manager of the Property, Lender reserves the right to require Premiums deposits at any time in its absolute discretion notwithstanding the fact that the default may be cured, or that the transfer or change be approved by Lender.

^^Affiliated Guarantor shall deliver evidence satisfactory to Lender of payment of premiums due under the insurance policies.

^^Affiliated Guarantor shall be required during the term of the Affiliated Guaranty to continue to provide Lender with evidence of original renewal policies or replacements of the insurance policies referenced in Section 3.1(a).

Lender shall be provided with renewal Certificates of Insurance, or Binders, not less than fifteen (15) days following expiration. The failure of Affiliated Guarantor to maintain the insurance required under this Article III shall not constitute a waiver of Affiliated Guarantor’s obligation to fulfill these requirements. 

^^All binders, policies, endorsements, certificates, and cancellation notices are to be sent to the Lender’s Address for Insurance Notification as set forth in the Defined Terms until changed by notice from Lender. 

^^Pursuant to the Illinois Collateral Protection Act and the Illinois Financial Institution Insurance Sales Law, Lender hereby notifies Affiliated Guarantor and Operating Lessee as follows: 

Affiliated Guarantor may obtain insurance required in connection with the Loan from any insurance agent, broker, or firm that sells such insurance, provided the insurance requirements in connection with the Loan are otherwise complied with, including without limitation, requirements with respect to financial strength and size of any proposed insurer. Affiliated Guarantor’s choice of insurance provider will not affect Lender’s credit decision or Affiliated Guarantor’s credit terms. Unless Affiliated Guarantor provides Lender with evidence of the insurance coverage as required in this Article III, Lender may purchase such insurance at Affiliated Guarantor’s expense to protect Lender’s interest in Affiliated Guarantor’s collateral. This insurance may, but need not, protect Affiliated Guarantor’s interests. The coverage Lender purchases may not pay any claim that Affiliated Guarantor makes or any claim that is made against Affiliated Guarantor in connection with the Property. Affiliated Guarantor may later cancel any insurance purchased by Lender, but only after providing Lender with evidence that Affiliated Guarantor has obtained insurance as required by this Mortgage. If Lender purchases insurance for the collateral, Affiliated Guarantor will be responsible for the costs of that insurance, including interest and any other charges Lender may impose in connection with the placement of such insurance, until the effective date of the cancellation or expiration of the insurance. The costs of the insurance may be added to the total outstanding balance of the Loan. The costs of the insurance acquired by Lender may be more than the cost of insurance Affiliated Guarantor may be able to obtain on its own. 

^ADJUSTMENT OF CLAIMS. 

^^Subject to clause (c) below, in the event of a Casualty or Condemnation where the claim for damage to, or loss or destruction of, all or a portion of the Property does not exceed $[[USD Value 9: Number]], Affiliated Guarantor may settle and adjust such claim; provided that such adjustment is carried out in a competent and timely manner.

^^Subject to clause (c) below, in the event of a Casualty or Condemnation where the claim for damage to, or loss or destruction of, all or a portion of the Property exceeds $[[USD Value 9]], Affiliated Guarantor may settle and adjust such claim only with the prior written consent of the Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

^^Notwithstanding the terms of clauses (a) and (b) above, Lender shall have the sole authority to adjust any claim with respect to a Casualty or Condemnation and to collection all insurance proceeds during the period an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 

^ASSIGNMENT TO LENDER. In the event of the foreclosure of this Mortgage or other transfer of the title to the Property in extinguishment of the Guaranteed Obligations, all right, title and interest of Affiliated Guarantor and/or Operating Lessee as applicable in and to any insurance policy, or premiums or payments in satisfaction of claims or any other rights under these insurance policies and any other insurance policies covering the Property shall pass to the transferee of the Property.

^^Affiliated Guarantor and/or Operating Lessee as applicable owns the Personal Property free from any lien, security interest, encumbrance or adverse claim, except as otherwise expressly approved by Lender in writing or as otherwise allowed hereunder. Affiliated Guarantor will notify Lender of, and will protect, defend and indemnify Lender against, all claims and demands of all persons at any time claiming any rights or interest in the Personal Property contrary to the preceding sentence.

^^Affiliated Guarantor and/or Operating Lessee as applicable will not remove the Personal Property without the prior written consent of Lender, except the items of Personal Property which are consumed or worn out in ordinary usage shall be promptly replaced by Affiliated Guarantor and/or Operating Lessee as applicable with other Personal Property of value equal to or greater than the value of the replaced Personal Property. 

^CHARACTERIZATION OF PROPERTY. The grant of a security interest to Lender in this Mortgage shall not be construed to limit or impair the lien of this Mortgage or the rights of Lender with respect to any property which is real property or which the parties have agreed to treat as real property. To the fullest extent permitted by law, everything used in connection with the production of Rents and Profits is, and at all times and for all purposes and in all proceedings, both legal and equitable, shall be regarded as real property, irrespective of whether or not the same is physically attached to the Land and/or Improvements. 

^PROTECTION AGAINST PURCHASE MONEY SECURITY INTERESTS. It is understood and agreed that in order to protect Lender from the effect of U.C.C. Section 9313, as amended from time to time and as enacted in the State, in the event that Affiliated Guarantor and/or Operating Lessee as applicable intends to purchase any goods which may become fixtures attached to the Property, or any part of the Property, and such goods will be subject to a purchase money security interest held by a seller or any other party: 

^^Before executing any security agreement or other document evidencing or perfecting the security interest, Affiliated Guarantor and/or Operating Lessee as applicable shall obtain the prior written approval of Lender. All requests for such written approval shall be in writing and contain the following information: (i) a description of the fixtures; (ii) the address at which the fixtures will be located; and (iii) the name and address of the proposed holder and proposed amount of the security interest. 

^^Affiliated Guarantor shall pay all sums and perform all obligations secured by the security agreement. A default by Affiliated Guarantor under the security agreement shall constitute a default under this Mortgage.

^^Lender shall have the right to acquire by assignment from the holder of the security interest for the Personal Property or fixtures, all contract rights, accounts receivable, negotiable or non-negotiable instruments, or other evidence of indebtedness and to enforce the security interest as assignee. 

^^The provisions of subparagraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 13.4 shall not apply if the goods which may become fixtures are of at least equivalent value and quality as the Personal Property being replaced and if the lien is permitted by Section 10.7(vii) or if the rights of the party holding the security interest are expressly subordinated to the lien and security interest of this Mortgage in a manner satisfactory to Lender. 

\centered **MISCELLANEOUS COVENANTS** 

^NO WAIVER. No single or partial exercise by Lender, or delay or omission in the exercise by Lender, of any right or remedy under the Security Documents shall preclude, waive or limit the exercise of any other right or remedy. Lender shall at all times have the right to proceed against any portion of, or interest in, the Property without waiving any other rights or remedies with respect to any other portion of the Property. No right or remedy under any of the Security Documents is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy but shall be cumulative and may be exercised concurrently with or independently from any other right and remedy under any of the Security Documents or under applicable law. 

^NOTICES. All notices, demands and requests given or required to be given by, pursuant to, or relating to, this Mortgage shall be in writing.
