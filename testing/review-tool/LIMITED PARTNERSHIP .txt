Unless the parties agree on a simplified appraisal procedure, if the parties are unable to reach agreement through negotiations between themselves, the fair market value of the Liquidating Partner’s interest in the Partnership shall be determined by appraisal. Each of the parties shall promptly select an appraiser qualified by appropriate licensure or certification to conduct appraisals of interests in a limited liability company, taking into consideration the nature of the assets owned and business  4824-1329-4339.8 conducted by the Partnership, and such appraisers shall then select a third such appraiser. The value of the Liquidating Partner’s interest shall be the average of the two appraised values that are closest together. Each party shall bear the cost of the appraiser chosen by it and the parties shall split the cost of the third appraiser. (c) Method of Valua tion and Discounts. The value of the Liquidating Partner’s interest in the Partnership, whether determined by negotiation or appraisal, shall be arrived at by first determining the value of the Partnership as a whole by reference to such financial data and the use of such valuation methods as are appropriate. 13.3 Payment Schedule. Payment for the interest in the Partnership of a Liquidating or redeeming Partner, including with respect to good will, as valued under Section 13.2 above, may be made by the Partnership over a period of up to five (5) years in equal monthly, quarterly or annual installments of principal, together with accrued interest from the effective date of the buy-out or redemption. The unpaid balance of the purchase price shall bear interest a t a variable rate equal to the minimum rate necessary to avoid the imputation of interest under the Internal Revenue Code. The unpaid balance of the purchase price need not be secured. The Partnership shall have the right to prepay all or any portion of such obligation at any time without notice or penalty. In the event the Partnership terminates under Article 14, below, prior to the payment in full by the Partnership of the foregoing obligation, the entire remaining balance of principal and accrued interest shall be immediately due and payable by the Partnership, as set forth in Section 14.3 below. \centered **DISSOLUTION AND TERMINATION** 14.1 Dissolution and Termination.

Upon dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner shall immediately commence to wind up the affairs of the Partnership and shall engage in an orderly disposition of its assets where such can be done at a fair value (except to the extent the General Partner may determine to distribute any assets to the Partners in kind). The items comprising the Profits or Losses of the Partnership, as the case may be, as well as any specially allocated items for the Fiscal Year in which the Partnership is terminated shall continue to be allocated to the Partners or their representatives and be credited or charged to their respective Capital Accounts in accordance with Articles 6 and 7, above. 14.3 Distribution of Liquidation Proceeds. Pursuant to the winding up of the Partnership’s affairs, the Partnership assets and the proceeds from the disposition of Partnership assets shall be applied in order of priority as follows: (a) First, to creditors of the Partnership other than Partners (and other than any former Partners receiving payments in buy-out of their interest in the Partnership under Section 13.3, above); (b) Second, to Partners for any debts of the Partnership to such Partners, including Partners being bought out under Section 13.3 above, pro rata; (c) Third, to Partners in the amount of the final balances in their respective Capital Accounts (after the allocation of all Profits, Losses and specially allocated items). Each Partner shall look solely to the assets of the Partnership for the return of such Partner’s investment in the Partnership, and if such assets or the proceeds from the liquidation of such assets are insufficient to return said investment, such Partner shall have no recourse against any other Partner. Liquidating distributions to Partners shall be made by the later of (i) the end of the Partnership taxable year in which Liquidation occurs, or (ii) ninety (90) days after Liquidation. 14.4 Return of Capital Contributions. No Partner shall be entitled to the return of specific property contributed to the Partnership nor to any payments in liquidation of such Partner’s interest in the Partnership other than in cash. 14.5 Negative Capital Account Balance. A negative balance in any Partner’s Capital Account which exists upon termination of the Partnership (after the allocation of all Profits and Losses through termination) shall not constitute a debt or liability of such Partner to the Partnership, to any creditor of the Partnership, to any other Partner, or to any other person for any purpose whatsoever,  4824-1329-4339.8 and such Partner shall have no obligation to make any additional capital contribution to the Partnership by reason of such negative balance. 14.6 Articles of Dissolution. When all debts, liabilities and obligations of the Partnership have been paid and discharged or adequate provisions have been made therefor and all of the remaining property and assets of the Partnership have been distributed to the Partners, Articles of Dissolution shall be executed and filed pursuant to Utah law. Upon issuance by the State of Utah of a certificate of dissolution, the Partnership shall be terminated. \centered **MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS** 15.1 Amendments.

The following additional definitions are supplied for purposes of this Addendum: (a) “Adjusted Capital Account” means a Partner’s Capital Account as of the end of any fiscal year, decreased by the items described in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) and (6). The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital Account is intended to comply with the provisions of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. (b) “Adjusted Tax Basis” means the adjusted tax basis of property for Federal income tax accounting purposes. (c) “Book Depreciation” means for each Partnership Fiscal Year or other period, an amount equal to the Tax Depreciation for such year or other period, except that if the Book Value of an asset differs from its adjusted tax basis at the beginning of such year or other period, Book Depreciation shall be an amount which bears the same relationship to such beginning Book Value as the Tax Depreciation for such year or other period bears to such beginning Adjusted Tax Basis; *provided, however*, that if the Tax Depreciation for such year is zero, Book Depreciation shall be determined with reference to such beginning Book Value using any reasonable method selected by the General Partner. The foregoing definition of Book Depreciation is intended to comply with the provisions of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(1)(g)(3) and shall be interpreted consistently herewith. (d) “Book Value” means the value of property as reflected on the books of the Partnership in accordance with Section B.1 hereof.

(h) “Section 704(c) Property” has the meaning set forth in Paragraph C.1 of this Addendum. (i) “Tax Depreciation” means for each Partnership Fiscal Year or other period, an amount equal to the depreciation, amortization or other cost recovery deduction allowable with respect to an asset for such year or other period for Federal income tax purposes. \centered **CAPITAL ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE RULES** **B.1** The Partners’ Capital Accounts shall be kept in accordance with the following rules.

Section 752; PAGE  \centered CAPITAL ACCOUNTING AND TAX ADDENDUM  4824-1329-4339.8 (h) the amount of such Partner’s individual liabilities which are assumed by the Partnership (other than liabilities described in subsection (b) above which are assumed by the Partnership); (i) such Partner’s allocable share of the Losses of the Partnership under Section 7.2 above and of any items of loss or deduction which are specially allocated pursuant to Paragraph C.2 of this Addendum; and (j) such Partner’s allocable share under Paragraph C.1(c) of this Addendum of any Book Depreciation or loss attributable to Section 704(c) Property, as computed for book purposes. The Partners’ Capital Accounts shall also be debited or credited as provided in Paragraphs B.2(c) and B.2(d) of this Addendum. Also, in determining the amount of any liability for purposes of this provision, there shall be taken into account I.R.C. Section 752(c) and any other applicable provisions of the I.R.C. and Regulations. **B.2** Valuation of Partnership Property; Capital Account Adjustments. The Book Value of Partnership property shall be its Adjusted Tax Basis except in the following instances: (a) Contributed Property.

(b) Distributed Property. The Book Value of property distributed (or deemed distributed) by the Partnership to any Partner, whether in connection with the Liquidation of the Partnership or otherwise, shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, to equal its Fair Market Value on the date of distribution (or deemed distribution), and the Capital Accounts of the Partners shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, to reflect the manner in which gain or loss, as computed for book purposes, would be allocated among the Partners if there were a taxable disposition of such property for such Fair Market Value. (c) Other Property at Time of Con tribution or Distribution. In connection with either (i) a contribution (or deemed contribution) of money or other property to the Partnership by a new or existing Partner in exchange for a new or increased interest in the Partnership, or (ii) a distribution (or deemed distribution) of money or other property by the Partnership to a withdrawing or continuing Partner in exchange for all or a portion of such Partner’s interest in the Partnership, or (iii) the Liquidation of the Partnership, the Book Values of all Partnership assets, including good will if applicable, shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, to equal their respective Fair Market Values on the date of such PAGE  \centered CAPITAL ACCOUNTING AND TAX ADDENDUM  4824-1329-4339.8 contribution or distribution (or dee med contribution or distribution), and the Capital Accounts of the Partners shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, to reflect the manner in which gain or loss, as computed for book purposes, would be allocated among the Partners if there were a taxable disposition of all such assets for such Fair Market Values; *provided, however*, in the case of Subparagraphs (i) and (ii) hereof, such adjustment need not be made if such contribution or distribution is of a de minimis amount or if the Partners reasonably determine that such adjustment is not necessary or appropriate in view of the cost to the Partnership of making such adjustment as compared with the distortion in the relative economic interests of the Partners which would result from not making such adjustment. Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) hereof are intended to comply with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(d), (e) and (f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. (d) Section 754 Adjustments. The Book Value of an item of Partnership property shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, to equal its Adjusted Tax Basis whenever an adjustment to the Adjusted Tax Basis of such item of Partnership property arises under I.R.C. Sections 732(d), 734 or 743 and such adjustment exceeds the difference between the Book Value of such item of Partnership property and its Adjusted Tax Basis prior to making such adjustment. Such increase or decrease in Book Value shall then be allocated to the Capital Accounts of the Partners in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m). This Paragraph shall be applied only after the application of Paragraphs B.2(a), (b) and (c), above. \centered **SPECIAL TAX ALLOCATION RULES** **C.1** Special Allocation Rules Where Book Value and Adjusted Tax Basis Are Unequal. Notwithstanding the general allocation rules set forth in Article 7 above, as to property the Book Value of which is different from its Adjusted Tax Basis (“Section 704(c) Property”), the following rules and definitions shall apply: (a) If the Book Value of property exceeds its Adjusted Tax Basis, such excess shall be referred to as “Built-in Gain.” Conversely, if the Adjusted Tax Basis of property exceeds its Book Value, such excess shall be referred to as “Built-in Loss.” (b) Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss may arise as the result of the contribution or deemed contribution of property to the Partnership by one or more Partners (the “Contributing Partners”) or as the result of the revaluation of existing Partnership property under Paragraph B.2 of this Addendum. If existing Partnership property is revalued, the existing Partners shall be considered the Contributing Partners as to such property. The term Contributing Partners shall include successors-in-interest thereto. (c) Book Depreciation, and gain or loss with respect to Section 704(c) Property as computed for book purposes, shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with the general profit and loss sharing percentages specified in Article 7, and the Partners’ Capital Accounts shall be adjusted accordingly, as set forth in Paragraph B.1 of this Addendum. PAGE  \centered CAPITAL ACCOUNTING AND TAX ADDENDUM  4824-1329-4339.8 (d ) Tax Depreciation, and gain or loss with respect to Section 704(c) Property as computed for tax purposes, shall be allocated to the Partners in a manner that takes into account the Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss with respect to such property, in accordance with Section 704(c) of the I.R.C. and equivalent principles, as follows, and such allocations shall not be independently reflected by further adjustments to the Partners’ Capital Accounts: (i) With respect to Built-in Gain property, [[Percentage 9]]% of any tax gain shall be allocated to the Contributing Partners in the same proportion as such Built-in Gain has been credited to their respective Capital Accounts; Tax Depreciation shall be allocated to the Part ners other than the Contributing Partners (the “Noncontributing Partners”) in the same proportion as, but in an amount not to exceed, the Book Depreciation with respect to such property which has been allocated to them under Paragraph C.1(c) of this Addendum; and any excess of such Tax Depreciation over the amount allocated to the Noncontributing Partners shall be allocated to the Contributing Partners in the same proportion that the Book Depreciation with respect to such property has been allocated to the Contributing Partners under Paragraph C.1(c) of this Addendum. These allocations shall continue until the Built-in Gain has been eliminated. Thereafter any Tax Depreciation and gain or loss with respect to such property shall be allocated to the Partners pursuant to the general profit and loss allocation provisions of Article 7 above. (ii) With respect to Built-in Loss property, [[Percentage 9]]% of any tax loss shall be allocated to the Contributing Partners in the same proportion as such Built-in Loss has been charged to their respective Capital Accounts; Tax Depreciation shall be allocated to the Noncontributing Partners in the same proportion as, but in an amount not to exceed, the Book Depreciation with respect to such property which has been allocated to them under Paragraph C.1(c) of this Addendum; and any excess of such Tax Depreciation over the amount allocated to the Noncontributing Partners shall be allocated to the Contributing Partners in the same proportion that the Book Depreciation with respect to such property has been allocated to the Contributing Partners under Paragraph C.1(c) of this Addendum. These allocations shall continue until the Built-in Loss has been eliminated. Thereafter any Tax Depreciation and gain or loss with res pect to such property shall be allocated to the Partners pursuant to the general profit and loss allocation provisions of Article 7 above. (iii) In the event that the allocation of tax gain, tax loss or Tax Depreciation to the Noncontributing Partners under Paragraph C.1(d)(i) or C.1(d)(ii) of this Addendum is limited by application of the “ceiling rule” set forth in Regulations Section 1.704-3(b)(1), the Partnership may do any of the following: (A) the Partnership may make reasonable curative allocations of income, gain, lo ss or deduction with respect to the tax item limited by the ceiling rule, including income from the disposition of contributed or revalued property, in accordance with the rules set forth in Regulations Section 1.704-3(c); or PAGE  \centered CAPITAL ACCOUNTING AND TAX ADDENDUM  4824-1329-4339.8 (B) the Partnership may make remedial allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to the tax item limited by the ceiling rule in accordance with the rules set forth in Regulations Section 1.704-3(d); or (C) if applicable, the Partnership may apply the “small disparity” rules of Regulations Section 1.704-3(e). The foregoing provision is intended to comply with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g) and Section 1.704-3(e) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. **C.2** Special and Regulatory Allocations. (a) Minimum Gain Chargeback. If there is a net decrease in Minimum Gain during any Partnership fiscal year, then in that event, prior to the making of any other allocation under this Article 7, there shall be specially allocated to all Partners items of income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) equal to their share of such net decrease in Minimum Gain within the meaning of Regulations Sections 1.704-2(f)(1) and 1.704-2(g)(2). (b) Qualified Income Offset. Subject to the provisions of Paragraph C.2(a) of this Addendum, in the event a Partn er unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation, or distribution described in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), items of income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate any deficit in such Partner’s Adjusted Capital Account as quickly as possible. This Paragraph C.2(b) is intended to comply with the qualified income offset requirement set forth in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. (c) Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any Partnership fiscal year shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance with the Partners’ percentage interests in Losses, as set forth in Section 7.2 above. This Paragraph C.2(c) is intended to comply with Regulations Section 1.704-2(e)(2) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
