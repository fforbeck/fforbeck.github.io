^^**Enforceability; Creation of Security Interest**. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Pledgor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Pledgor, enforceable against the Pledgor in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization and similar laws of general applicability affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether enforcement is sought in proceedings in equity or at law. The security interest created hereby constitutes (i) a legal and valid security interest in the Pledged Collateral owned by the Pledgor securing the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations, and (ii) a first priority and perfected security interest in the Pledged Collateral. The security interest created hereby shall be prior to any lien on the Pledged Collateral, other than liens arising by operation of law and that would be prior in right.

^^**Ownership and Liens**. The Pledgor is the record and beneficial owner of Blue Fin Shares, and the Blue Fin Shares constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Blue Fin Capital, Inc. The Pledgor owns the Pledged Collateral, free and clear of all liens, except for the security interest created by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents (as defined in the Investment Agreement). The Pledgor has not executed any other security agreement affecting the Pledged Collateral, and no financing statement or other similar instrument in respect of the Pledged Collateral is in effect or on file in any recording office in any jurisdiction, except pursuant to the Transaction Documents.

^**Covenants**. The Pledgor shall comply with the covenants contained in this Section 6 at all times during the period of time this Agreement remains in effect unless the Secured Party shall otherwise consent in writing:

^^**Ownership and Liens**. The Pledgor will maintain good and valid title to the Pledged Collateral, free and clear of all liens, except for the security interest created by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.

^^**Adverse Claim**. The Pledgor will promptly notify the Secured Party of any claim, action or proceeding affecting ownership of the Pledged Collateral, or any part thereof, or the security interest created hereunder. The Pledgor will promptly deliver to the Secured Party a copy of all written notices received by the Pledgor with respect to the Pledged Collateral. The Pledgor will defend the Pledged Collateral pledged hereby against, and take such other action as is necessary to remove, any lien or charge on, defect in title to, or other encumbrance on, any of the Pledged Collateral.

^^**Further Assurances**. The Pledgor will from time to time at its expense promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents and take all further action necessary or appropriate or that the Secured Party may reasonably request in order (i) to perfect and protect the security interest created or purported to be created hereby and the priority of such security interest, (ii) to enable the Secured Party to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder in respect of the Pledged Collateral, and (iii) to otherwise effect the purposes of this Agreement.

^**Transfer or Encumbrance**. The Pledgor will not (i) sell, assign (by operation of law or otherwise), transfer or otherwise dispose of the Pledgor’s rights in any of the Pledged Collateral, or (ii) grant a lien or security interest in or execute, file or record any financing statement or other security instrument with respect to the Pledged Collateral to any party other than the Secured Party.

^**Remedies Upon Foreclosure Event**. If a Foreclosure Event occurs, the Secured Party may exercise any and all the rights, powers and remedies of any owner of the Pledged Collateral (including the right to vote the securities and receive dividends and distributions with respect to such securities) and shall have and may exercise without demand any and all the rights and remedies granted to a secured party upon default under the UCC or otherwise available to the Secured Party under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, following a Foreclosure Event, the Secured Party is authorized to sell, assign, convey, transfer and deliver at its discretion, from time to time, all or any part of the Pledged Collateral together with all rights and entitlements appurtenant thereto at any private sale or public auction, on not less than ten (10) days written notice to the Pledgor, at such price or prices and upon such terms as the Secured Party may deem commercially reasonable. The Pledgor shall have no right to redeem the Pledged Collateral after any such sale or assignment. At any such sale or auction, the Pledgor may bid for, and become the purchaser of, the whole or any part of the Pledged Collateral offered for sale. In case of any such sale, after deducting the reasonable costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses of sale and delivery, the remaining proceeds of such sale shall be applied to the Secured Obligations (first, to the payment in full of all amounts owing under the Investment Agreement, with the balance to the remaining Secured Obligations); **provided** that after payment in full of the indebtedness under the Note and all other Secured Obligations, the balance of the proceeds of sale then remaining shall be paid to the Pledgor, and the Pledgor shall be entitled to any remaining portion of the Pledged Collateral. The Pledgor shall be liable for any deficiency if the remaining proceeds are insufficient to pay the indebtedness under the Note in full and the other Secured Obligations, including the reasonable fees of any attorneys employed by the Secured Party to collect such deficiency. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Foreclosure Event and upon request of the Secured Party, the Pledgor will not exercise any voting rights with respect to the Pledged Collateral.

^**Waiver of Presentment**. The Pledgor hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, presentment, notice (other than such notices as are expressly provided for) and demand with respect to breaches of the payment of any of the Secured Obligations.

^**Power of Attorney; Performance**. The Pledgor hereby irrevocably appoints the Secured Party as its attorney-in-fact during the term of this Agreement (such power of attorney being coupled with an interest and with full right of substitution) and proxy to exercise any voting rights with respect to the Pledged Collateral, and to take such other actions and exercise such other remedies provided herein, but only upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Foreclosure Event. If the Pledgor fails to perform any obligation hereunder required to be performed on the part of the Pledgor, the Secured Party may itself perform (or cause the performance of) such obligation, and the reasonable expenses of the Secured Party incurred in connection therewith shall be paid by the Pledgor.

^**No Assumption of Duties; Reasonable Care**. The rights and powers granted to the Secured Party hereunder are being granted in order to preserve and protect the Secured Party’s security interest in and to the Pledged Collateral granted hereby and will not be interpreted to, and will not, impose any duties on the Secured Party in connection therewith. The Secured Party will be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Pledged Collateral in its possession if the Pledged Collateral is accorded treatment substantially similar to that which the Secured Party accords its own property.

^**Miscellaneous**.  

^^**Amendment**. No modification, consent or amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid or effective unless the same is in writing and signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced.

^^**Waiver by the Secured Party**. The Secured Party may waive any Foreclosure Event without waiving any other subsequent Foreclosure Event. Neither the failure by the Secured Party to exercise, nor the delay by the Secured Party in exercising, any right or remedy upon any Foreclosure Event shall be construed as a waiver of such Foreclosure Event or as a waiver of the right to exercise any such right or remedy at a later date. No single or partial exercise by the Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder shall exhaust the same or shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof, and every such right or remedy hereunder may be exercised at any time. No waiver of any provision hereof or consent to any departure by the Pledgor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Secured Party and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instances, for the purpose for which given and to the extent therein specified. No notice to or demand on the Pledgor in any case shall of itself entitle the Pledgor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

^^**Costs and Expenses**. The Pledgor will, within five (5) days after demand, pay to the Secured Party the amount of any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and expenses and all costs and expenses of collection and sale of collateral), which the Secured Party may incur after a Foreclosure Event in connection with (i) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights or remedies of the Secured Party under the Investment Agreement, this Agreement or applicable law, or (ii) the failure by the Pledgor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof.

^^**GOVERNING LAW**. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF, EXCEPT FOR SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-4102 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW.

If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws, such provision shall be fully severable, shall not impair or invalidate the remainder of this Agreement and the effect thereof shall be confined to the provision held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable
