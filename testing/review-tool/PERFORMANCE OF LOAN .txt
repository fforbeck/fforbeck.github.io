^Upon the Buyer’s acquisition of the Property and pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents, (i) the Seller shall continue in its capacity as the “Borrower” under the Loan, (ii) the Seller shall remain personally liable to the Lender to repay the Loan under the Note (as defined on Exhibit B), (iii) the Seller shall remain personally liable as to the Swap Obligations , (iii) the Existing Guarantors shall continue in their capacity as guarantors of certain Loan obligations and the Swap Obligations, (iv) the Property shall continue to serve as security for the Loan and the Swap Obligations and (v) the Buyer shall become the “Mortgagor” under the Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as between the Seller Parties and the Buyer Parties, (i) the Buyer agrees to assume certain obligations of the Seller as “Borrower” under the Loan, (ii) the Buyer agrees to assume certain obligations of the Seller under the Swap Agreement, (iii) the Seller agrees to retain certain obligations of the Seller as “Borrower” under the Loan and under the Swap Agreement and (iv) the Existing Guarantors agree to retain their guaranty obligations with respect to the Loan and the Swap Agreement, all as more particularly set forth in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer Parties’ sole remedy for a breach of the representations made in paragraph 2(a) and 2(h) above shall be limited to the indemnities in this Section 8(a).

^^^Seller Indemnity Obligations Triggered; No Acceleration. In the event that Buyer is entitled to be indemnified by Seller and each Existing Guarantor under this Section 8(a) for any of the foregoing reasons and the Lender does not accelerate the Loan as a result of such breach or non-performance of Seller and/or any Existing Guarantor, entitlement to such indemnification shall accrue to Buyer immediately; provided, however, that Buyer shall continue to comply with its obligations hereunder as to the Assumed Obligations, including, without limitation, its obligation to make the Monthly Note Payments and Monthly Swap Payments directly to the Lender and comply with the Buyer’s obligations as “Mortgagor” under the Mortgage and Mortgage Modification. 

^^^Seller Indemnity Obligations Triggered; Acceleration. In the event that Buyer is entitled to be indemnified by Seller and each Existing Guarantor under this Section 8(a) and the Lender accelerates the Loan, entitlement to such indemnification shall accrue to Buyer immediately; provided, however, that Buyer shall be obligated to make Buyer’s Acceleration Payment (as hereinafter defined) directly to the Lender, and Seller and/or any Existing Guarantor shall be obligated to make Seller’s Acceleration Payment (as hereinafter defined), if any, directly to the Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the acceleration of the Loan, (i) Buyer hereby covenants and agrees that Buyer shall pay, directly to the Lender, the outstanding principal balance under the Note, or such lesser amount as the Lender may have accelerated, and any accrued interest thereon, including any late fees which accrue as a result of, and any default interest which accrues as a result of, any breach or non-performance by Buyer of the Assumed Obligations and/or this Agreement, but excluding any late fees and any default interest which accrue as a result of any breach or non-performance by Seller or any Existing Guarantor of the Retained Obligations and/or this Agreement (such sums shall collectively be referred to herein as **Buyer’s Acceleration Payment**), (ii) Seller shall pay any late fees and any default interest which accrues as a result of, any breach or non-performance by Seller of the Retained Obligations and/or this Agreement (such sums shall collectively be referred to herein as **Seller’s Acceleration Payment**), (iii) the Seller Parties or the Buyer Parties, as applicable in accordance with Section 22 below, shall pay, directly to the Lender, the Termination Amount (if the Lender has accelerated the entire outstanding principal balance of the Loan, and such Termination Amount is due as a result), and (iv) in the event the Lender accelerates the Loan on the basis of several defaults which include (and are stated in writing by Lender to include) Buyer’s failure to make Monthly Note Payments or Monthly Swap Payments, the parties agree that such failure constitutes a controlling default and Buyer shall pay all applicable default interest and any applicable late fee, regardless of any non-monetary default of the Seller Parties. 

^^Buyer’s and Buyer Parent’s Indemnity. Buyer and Buyer Parent agree to indemnify, defend and hold Seller Parties and their officers, directors, partners, members, agents, employees, affiliates, attorneys, heirs, successors and assigns (each a “Seller Indemnified Party” and collectively, “Seller’s Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against any and all liabilities, liens, claims, damages, costs, expenses, suits or judgments paid or incurred by any of Seller’s Indemnified Parties and all expenses related thereto, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees arising out of or in any way connected or related to (i) any liability Seller Parties have to Lender arising because of a breach or nonperformance by Buyer of any of the Assumed Obligations, (ii) any breach or nonperformance by Buyer or Buyer Parent of any provision or covenant contained in this Agreement and resulting in any Seller Parties having liability to Lender, including, but not limited to, a Buyer Default under Section 9, or (iii) the breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer or Buyer Parent contained in this Agreement and resulting in liability to Lender by any Seller Parties (each, an “Event(s) of Buyer Indemnification”). The indemnities set forth in this Section shall survive Closing without limitation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Buyer or Buyer Parent be obligated to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless any Seller Indemnified Party for any liabilities of a Seller Indemnified Party to the extent arising out of the Retained Obligations. Buyer’s and Buyer Parent’s obligations under this Agreement shall be secured by a mortgage on the Property, subordinate to the mortgage securing the Loan and the Swap Obligations, in the format attached hereto as **Exhibit “D”** (the “Second Mortgage”). If the Lender forecloses under the Mortgage, the parties acknowledge and agree that neither Buyer nor Buyer Parent shall have any liability to the Seller Indemnified Parties beyond the difference between any amount recovered upon a sale of the Property to a third party (or, if Lender or its affiliate or assignee takes title to the Property, the “Market Value” of the Property at the time of foreclosure) and any amounts owed to the Lender and the Seller by the Buyer hereunder. As used in the previous sentence, “Market Value” shall mean the fair market value of the Property determined by agreement between the Buyer and Seller within thirty (30) days of the Lender (or its affiliate or assignee) taking title. If such agreement cannot be reached, “Market Value” shall be determined as follows: the Seller and Buyer shall each select one independent appraiser within fifteen (15) days of the expiration of the aforementioned thirty-day period, which two appraisers shall each make a determination of the fair market value. In the event a party shall fail to select an independent appraiser within such fifteen-day period, the appraisal from the other party shall constitute the Market Value. In the event the fair market values of the two appraisers differ by less than [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the highest of such values, the fair market values of the two appraisals shall be averaged and the resulting amount shall be the Market Value of the Property. In the event the fair market values of the two appraisals differ by more than [[Percentage 1]]% of the highest of such values, then the two appraisers shall jointly select a third appraiser, who shall choose the appraisal of the initial two appraisals that the third appraiser determines to be closest in value to the fair market value of the Property, which value shall constitute the Market Value of the Property. Costs of the initial appraisers shall be borne by the parties who appointed them. Costs of the third appraiser, if applicable, shall be divided equally. 

^**Buyer or Buyer Parent Default.** Time is of the essence hereof. The term “Buyer Default,” as used in this Agreement, shall mean the occurrence of any one or more of the following events: 

^^The failure of Buyer or Buyer Parent to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement after seven (7) days written notice from Seller including, but not limited to, the Assumed Obligations; 

^^An Event of Default under the Second Mortgage; 

^^The filing of a proceeding in bankruptcy or arrangement or reorganization by or against Buyer or Buyer Parent pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code or any similar law, federal or state, including but not limited to: 

^^^Buyer or Buyer Parent shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or shall be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent, or shall file any petition or answer seeking or acquiescing in any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief for itself under any present or future federal, state, or other statute, law or regulation relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other relief for debtors, or shall seek or consent to or acquiesce in the appointment of any trustee, receiver or liquidator of any party hereto, or shall make any general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall admit in writing its inability to pay or shall fail to pay its material debts generally as they become due;

^^^A court of competent jurisdiction shall enter an order, judgment or decree approving a petition filed against Buyer or Buyer Parent seeking any reorganization, dissolution or similar relief under any present or future federal, state, or other statute, law or regulation relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other relief for debtors, or any party hereto shall be the subject of an order for relief entered by such a court, and such order, judgment or decree shall remain unvacated and unstaved for an aggregate of sixty (60) days (whether or not consecutive) from the fist date of entry thereof, or any trustee, receiver, custodian or liquidator of Buyer shall be appointed without the consent or acquiescence of such party and such appointment shall remain unvacated and unstayed for an aggregate of sixty (60) days (whether or not consecutive);

^^The dissolution or termination of the existence or the insolvency of Buyer or Buyer Parent; the appointment of a receiver for any part of the Property; or any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceedings under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Buyer. 

^^Commencement of foreclosure, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by Lender against the Property, which commencement results from the breach or non-performance of Buyer or Buyer Parent’s obligations under this Agreement. 

^^Final judgment(s) for the payment of money shall be rendered against the Buyer or Buyer Parent and shall remain undischarged for a period of thirty (30) days during which execution shall not be effectively stayed, if such judgment(s) materially, adversely impacts Buyer or Buyer Parent’s ability to comply with the terms of this Agreement. 

^**Rights and Remedies Upon Event of Buyer Default****.** Subject to the limitations contained in this Section 10, upon the occurrence of a Buyer Default, and the Buyer or Buyer Parent’s failure to cure such default within the time periods specified in this Agreement, Seller shall have the right to exercise any of the following remedies: 

^^Acceleration. Seller may, without further demand, presentment or notice to Buyer or Buyer Parent, declare the following to be due and payable to the Seller:

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or the Second Mortgage (defined in Section 8) to the contrary, the Seller may not declare the foregoing amounts due and payable to the Seller unless the Lender has accelerated the indebtedness owed under the Loan Documents in writing or served a Notice of Foreclosure under Minnesota Statutes, Chapters 580, 581, or 582. 

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or the Second Mortgage to the contrary, any payment by the Buyer to cure any monetary default under this Agreement and/or the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, Buyer’s Acceleration Payment, made post-Lender-acceleration and/or during the period of redemption after foreclosure sale shall be paid directly to the Lender and applied against the indebtedness under the Loan Documents.

No delay or omission of any party hereto in the exercise of any right or power accruing hereunder shall impair any such right or power or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and/or in the Second Mortgage, no party shall be liable to any other party hereunder and/or under the Second Mortgage for any indirect, consequential or punitive damages.

^**Entire Agreement.** This Agreement and the documents contemplated to be executed herewith constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall not be amended unless such amendment is in writing and executed by each of the parties. The Agreement supersedes all prior negotiations regarding the subject matter hereof.

The prevailing party shall be determined by the court based upon an assessment of which party’s major arguments or position prevailed. This provision shall in no way affect or diminish the Seller’s rights to reasonable attorneys fees or costs under the Second Mortgage. 

^**Swap Termination**. 

^^Payoff Prior to Sale or Acceleration. Prior to the Buyer’s sale of the Property or any acceleration of the Loan by the Lender, Buyer and Seller Parties agree that either Buyer or Seller Parties may periodically communicate with Lender to determine the Termination Amount at any given time applicable on a payoff of the full principal and interest amount due and owing on the Loan; Buyer and Seller Parties further agree that each shall cooperate with the other as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate any such communication. In the event there is no such fee applicable, Seller determines at its discretion that such fee is in an amount that Seller agrees to pay or Buyer determines at its discretion that such fee is in an amount that Buyer agrees to pay, and upon written request from the other (supported by documentation from Lender evidencing current the Termination Amount), (i) Buyer agrees to promptly make the Buyer’s Acceleration Payment directly to the Lender, (ii) Seller agrees to promptly make the Seller’s Acceleration Payment (if any) directly to the Lender and (iii) the party who has agreed, in its discretion, to pay the Termination Amount shall pay such Termination Amount directly to the Lender. 

^^Sale of the Property by Buyer. Upon any sale of the Property by Buyer and payment of the Buyer’s Acceleration Payment to the Lender in connection therewith, the Buyer shall be responsible for payment of the Termination Amount (if any) directly to the Lender, provided, however, that the Seller shall be responsible to make the Seller’s Acceleration Payment (if any) directly to the Lender. 

^^Acceleration of the Loan. 

^^^Payment by Buyer. Upon any acceleration of the Loan by the Lender for a failure of the Buyer to perform on the Assumed Obligations including, but not limited to, the failure to make the Monthly Note Payments and Monthly Swap Payments, the Buyer agrees to promptly make the Buyer’s Acceleration Payment and Termination Amount directly to the Lender.

^^^Payment by Seller. Upon any acceleration of the Loan by the Lender for a failure of the Seller to perform on the Retained Obligations, the Seller agrees to promptly make the Seller’s Acceleration Payment directly to the Lender and, except as provided hereinafter, to promptly pay the Termination Amount directly to the Lender. To the extent the Lender accelerates the Loan on the basis of several defaults which include (and are stated in writing by Lender to include) Buyer’s failure to make the Monthly Note Payments or Monthly Swap Payments, the parties agree that such failure constitutes a controlling default and the Buyer agrees to promptly make the Buyer’s Acceleration Payment and Termination Amount and any applicable late fee and any applicable default interest directly to the Lender regardless of any non-monetary default of the Seller Parties.

^^Termination Amount. In the event that the Termination Amount is a credit owed by Lender, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, such amount shall be shared by the Seller and the Buyer in proportion to the length of time the parties have owned the Property during the term of the Loan.
