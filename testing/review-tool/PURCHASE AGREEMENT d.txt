^^Binding Effect. Each Transaction Document to which the Seller is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership, conservatorship or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and, if applicable, the rights of creditors of corporations from time to time in effect or by general principles of equity.

Such representations and warranties speak as of the Closing Date, but shall survive the sale, transfer and assignment of the Receivables listed on the Schedule of Receivables by the Seller to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, [the sale, transfer and assignment of the Receivables listed on the Schedule of Receivables by the Purchaser to the Depositor pursuant to the [intermediate purchase agreement], the sale, transfer and assignment of the Receivables listed on the Schedule of Receivables by the Depositor to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale Agreement and the pledge of the Receivables by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

^Repurchase upon Breach. (a) Upon discovery by or notice to the Purchaser or the Seller of a breach of any of the representations and warranties described in Section 3.2 with respect to any Receivable listed on the Schedule of Receivables at the time such representations and warranties were made which materially and adversely affects the interests of the Noteholders, the party discovering such breach or receiving such notice shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other party hereto; *provided, that* delivery of the Monthly Servicer 

Purchase Agreement

Report, which identifies that Receivables are being or have been repurchased, shall be deemed to constitute prompt notice of such breach; *provided*, *further*, the failure to give such notice shall not affect any obligation of the Seller hereunder. If the breach materially and adversely affects the interests of the Noteholders, then the Seller shall either (i) correct or cure such breach or (ii) purchase (or cause to be purchased) such Receivable from the holder thereof, in either case on or before the last day of the second Collection Period (or, at the option of the Seller, the last day of the first Collection Period) following the date the Seller became aware of or was notified of such breach. Any such breach or failure will be deemed to not have a material and adverse effect if such breach or failure does not affect the ability of the Purchaser (or its assignee) to collect, receive and retain timely payment in full on such Receivable, including Liquidation Proceeds. Any such purchase by the Seller shall be at a price equal to the related Repurchase Price. In consideration for such repurchase, the Seller shall make (or shall cause to be made) a payment to the Purchaser equal to the Repurchase Price by depositing (or causing to be deposited) such amount into the Collection Account on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date immediately following the date of such repurchase. Upon payment of such Repurchase Price by the Seller, the Purchaser shall release and shall execute and deliver such instruments of release, transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse or representation, as may be reasonably requested by the Seller to evidence such release, transfer or assignment or more effectively vest in the Seller or its designee any Receivable listed on the Schedule of Receivables and related Purchased Assets repurchased pursuant to this Section 3.3. It is understood and agreed that the right to cause the Seller to repurchase [(or to enforce the obligation of [intermediate purchaser] under the [intermediate purchase agreement] to repurchase)] any Receivable listed on the Schedule of Receivables as described above shall constitute the sole remedy respecting such breach available to the Purchaser. 

^^[In addition to the foregoing repurchase obligations, if the interest of the Purchaser in any Receivable listed on the Schedule of Receivables is materially and adversely affected by a breach by [intermediate purchaser] of a representation or warranty relating to such Receivable in the [intermediate purchase agreement], the Seller shall repurchase such Receivable from the Purchaser but only if BANA shall in fact repurchase such Receivable. the Seller shall promptly remit into the Collection Account the purchase price paid with respect to such Receivable.]

^^The Seller shall maintain (or shall cause the Servicer to maintain) its computer systems so that, on and after the conveyance under this Agreement of the Receivables listed on the Schedule of Receivables on the Closing Date, the master computer records (including any backup archives, it being understood that any such backup archives may not reflect such interest until thirty-five (35) days after the applicable changes are made to such master computer records) that refer to a Receivable shall indicate clearly the interest of the Purchaser (or any subsequent assignee of the Purchaser) in such Receivable and that such Receivable is owned by such Person. 

^^If at any time the Seller shall propose to sell, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer any interest in motor vehicle receivables to any prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee, the Seller shall give to such prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee computer tapes, Records or printouts (including any restored from backup archives) that, if they shall refer in any manner whatsoever to any Receivable listed on the Schedule of Receivables, shall indicate clearly that such Receivable has been sold and is owned by the Purchaser (or any subsequent assignee of the Purchaser). 

^Other Liens or Interests. Except for the conveyances and grants of security interests pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the Seller shall not sell, pledge, assign or transfer the Receivables listed on the Schedule of Receivables or other property transferred to the Purchaser to any other Person, or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any interest therein, and the Seller shall defend the right, title and interest of the Purchaser in, to and under such Receivables or other property transferred to the Purchaser against all claims of third parties claiming through or under the Seller.

^\centered MISCELLANEOUS 

^Transfers Intended as Sale; Security Interest. 

^^Each of the parties hereto expressly intends and agrees that the transfers contemplated and effected under this Agreement are complete and absolute sales and transfers rather than pledges or assignments of only a security interest and shall be given effect as such for all purposes. It is further the intention of the parties hereto that the Receivables listed on the Schedule of Receivables and related Purchased Assets shall not be treated as property of [BANA by the FDIC or other governmental authority acting as conservator or receiver of BANA in a conservatorship, receivership, insolvency or other similar proceeding in respect of BANA under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1811 et seq. or other applicable law] [the Seller’s estate in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of the Seller.] The sales and transfers by the Seller of the Receivables listed on the Schedule of Receivables and related Purchased Assets hereunder are and shall be without recourse to, or representation or warranty (express or implied) by, the Seller, except as otherwise specifically provided herein. The limited rights of recourse specified herein against the Seller are intended to provide a remedy for breach of representations and warranties relating to the condition of the property sold, rather than to the collectibility of the Receivables. 

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Receivables listed on the Schedule of Receivables and other Purchased Assets are held to be property of the Seller, or if for any reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create indebtedness or a security interest in such Receivables and other Purchased Assets, then it is intended that: 

^^^This Agreement shall be deemed to be a security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the New York UCC and the UCC of any other applicable jurisdiction; 

^^^The conveyance provided for in Section 2.1 shall be deemed to be a grant by the Seller of, and the Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser, a security interest in all of its right (including the power to convey title thereto), title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to the Receivables listed on the Schedule of Receivables and other Purchased Assets, to secure such indebtedness and the performance of the obligations of the Seller hereunder; 

^^^The possession by the Purchaser or its agent of the Receivables Files related to the Receivables listed on the Schedule of Receivables and any other property as constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be deemed to be “possession by the secured party” or possession by the purchaser or a person designated by such purchaser, for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the New York UCC and the UCC of any other applicable jurisdiction; and 

^^^Notifications to persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from persons holding such property, shall be deemed to be 

Purchase Agreement

notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, bailees or agents (as applicable) of the Purchaser for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under applicable law. 

^Notices, Etc. All demands, notices and communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered or mailed by registered or certified first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, hand delivery, prepaid courier service, or by facsimile, and addressed in each case as specified on Schedule I to the Sale Agreement or at such other address as shall be designated in a written notice to the other parties hereto. Any notice required or permitted to be mailed to a Noteholder shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, at the address of such Noteholder as shown in the Note Register. Delivery shall occur only upon receipt or reported tender of such communication by an officer of the recipient entitled to receive such notices located at the address of such recipient for notices hereunder; *provided, however,* that any notice to a Noteholder mailed within the time prescribed in this Agreement shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Noteholder shall receive such notice. 

^Choice of Law. **THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW BUT EXCLUDING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ALL OTHER CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS, AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.** 

^Headings. The section headings hereof have been inserted for convenience only and shall not be construed to affect the meaning, construction or effect of this Agreement. 

^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. 

^Amendment. 

^^Any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended by the Seller and the Purchaser with prior written notice to each Rating Agency but without the consent of the Indenture Trustee, any Noteholder, the Issuer, [the Swap Counterparty,] [other intermediate purchasers,] the Owner Trustee, BANA, the Depositor or any other Person subject to subsection (d) of this Section 4.6; *provided* that (i) such amendment shall not, as evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate of the Seller or the Purchaser or an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee materially and adversely affect the interests of the Noteholders or (ii) the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect to such amendment; *provided further,* that in the case of any amendment pursuant to this Section 4.6(a), such amendment shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel, (i) affect the treatment of the Notes as indebtedness for federal income tax purposes, (ii) be deemed to cause, for federal income tax purposes, a taxable exchange of the Notes or (iii) cause the Issuer (or any part 

Purchase Agreement

thereof) to be treated as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. 

^^Subject to subsection (d) of this Section 4.6, this Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Seller and the Purchaser, with the consent of the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than a majority of the Note Balance of the Controlling Class for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders. It will not be necessary for the consent of Noteholders to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or consent, but it will be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents (and any other consents of Noteholders provided for in this Agreement) and of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by Noteholders will be subject to such reasonable requirements as the Indenture Trustee may prescribe, including the establishment of record dates pursuant to the Note Depository Agreement. 

^^Prior to the execution of any such amendment to this Agreement, the Seller shall provide written notification of the substance of such amendment to each Rating Agency; and promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent, the Seller shall furnish a copy of such amendment or consent to each Rating Agency and the Indenture Trustee. 

^^Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to receive and conclusively rely upon an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement and that all conditions precedent to the execution and delivery of such amendment have been satisfied. The Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such amendment which adversely affects the Owner Trustee’s or the Indenture Trustee’s, as applicable, own rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement may not be amended in any way that would materially and adversely affect the Owner Trustee’s, Indenture Trustee’s, [the Swap Counterparty’s] or the Administrator’s rights, privileges, indemnities, duties or obligations under this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or otherwise without the prior written consent of such party. 

^Waivers. No failure or delay on the part of the Purchaser, the Seller, the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in exercising any power or right hereunder (to the extent such Person has any power or right hereunder) shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. No notice to or demand on the Purchaser or the Seller in either case shall entitle it to any notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No waiver or approval by any party under this Agreement shall, except as may otherwise be stated in such waiver or approval, be applicable to subsequent transactions. No waiver or approval under this Agreement shall require any similar or dissimilar waiver or approval thereafter to be granted hereunder. 

^Entire Agreement. The Transaction Documents contain a final and complete integration of all prior expressions by the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter thereof and shall constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to 

Purchase Agreement

the subject matter thereof, superseding all prior oral or written understandings. There are no unwritten agreements among the parties. 

^Severability of Provisions. If any one or more of the covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement shall be for any reason whatsoever held invalid, then such covenants, agreements, provisions or terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. 

^Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall create and constitute the continuing obligations of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms, and shall remain in full force and effect until such time as the parties hereto shall agree. 

^Acknowledgment and Agreement.
