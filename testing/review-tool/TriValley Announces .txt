BAKERSFIELD, CA, [[Date 1: Date]]---Tri-Valley Corporation (NYSE AMEX-TIV) announced today that it executed a Securities Purchase Agreement on [[Date 1]], with a group of institutional investors to purchase $[[USD Value 2]] million of its common stock and warrants in a registered direct offering of securities. Net proceeds from this offering will be used to drill a horizontal injector well to evaluate Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) at its Pleasant Valley heavy oil project at Oxnard, California, for future use in the development and production of heavy oil reserves. Tri-Valley will use the remaining proceeds for start-up operations of existing wells and production facilities on its Claflin property near Bakersfield, California, and for working capital purposes.

Under the terms of the definitive agreements, the investors purchased [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of Tri-Valley's common stock at $[[USD Value 3: Number]] per share, for a total of $[[USD Value 2]] million in gross proceeds, and received warrants to purchase up to [[Shares 2: Number]] shares (the "Warrants") in the aggregate. The Warrants include Series A Warrants to purchase up to [[Shares 3: Number]] shares of common stock at $[[USD Value 4: Number]] per share for five years and Series B Warrants to purchase up to [[Shares 3]] shares of common stock at $[[USD Value 5: Number]] per share for seven years. Subject to certain limitations, the Company may also be obligated to issue to the investors a limited number of additional shares pursuant to certain purchase price share adjustments on [[Date 2: Date]] and [[Date 3: Date]] that may occur dependent upon the then current price of the Companyâ€™s common stock in relation to the orig inal issue price. All of such Warrants contain customary adjustments for corporate events such as reorganizations, splits, dividends, and the exercise prices of all such Warrants are subject to anti-dilution adjustments in the event of additional issuances of common stock below the exercise price then in effect.

The offering of the shares was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and declared effective by the SEC (file no. 333-163442) on [[Date 4: Date]]. Roth Capital Partners acted as financial advisor to the Company in the transaction.

**Recent Asset Sale**  
Tri-Valley also announced that it has recently completed the $[[USD Value 1: Number]] cash sale of a surplus steam generator, with a rated heating capacity of 50 million British thermal units per hour, which had been refurbished by its Great Valley Production Services subsidiary. In addition, Tri-Valley is negotiating the sale of its South Belridge and Shields-Arms leases. Based on a multiple of current annual net cash flow, the Company expects that the leases could generate an aggregate sales price of between $[[USD Value 6: Number]] and $[[USD Value 7: Number]] million. However, the actual sales proceeds could vary due to a number of contingencies including, but not limited to, changes in oil and gas prices, future operating results or changes in reserve estimates. The Company previously had identified these leases as being considered for divest iture in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended [[Date 5: Date]].
