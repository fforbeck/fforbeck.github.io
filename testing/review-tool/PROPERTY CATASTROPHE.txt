^As regards earthquake (the epicenter of which need not necessarily be within the territorial confines referred to in the opening paragraph of this article) and fire following directly occasioned by the earthquake, only those individual fire losses which commence during the period of 168 consecutive hours may be included in the Reassured’s “Loss Occurrence”.

^As regards freeze, only individual losses directly occasioned by collapse, breakage of glass and water damage (caused by bursting of frozen pipes and tanks) may be included in the Reassured’s “Loss Occurrence”.

^As respects to those “Loss Occurrences” referred to in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of Paragraph A above, if the disaster, accident, or loss occasioned by the event is of greater duration than 72 consecutive hours, then the Reassured may divide that disaster or loss into two or more “Loss Occurrences,” provided no two periods overlap and no individual loss is included in more than one such period, and provided that no period commence earlier than the date and time of the occurrence of the first recorded individual loss sustained by the Reassured arising out of that disaster, accident, or loss.

^This Agreement applies only to that portion of any Policy which a Reassured retains net for its own respective account, and in calculating the amount of any loss hereunder and also in computing the amount or amounts in excess of which this Agreement attaches, only loss or losses in respect of that portion of any Policy which the Reassured retains net for their own respective account shall be included.

^The amount of the Reinsurer’s liability hereunder in respect of any loss or losses shall not be increased by reason of the inability of a Reassured to collect from any other reinsurers, whether specific or general, any amounts which may have become due from such reinsurers, whether such inability arises from the insolvency of such other reinsurers or otherwise.

^Inter-company reinsurance among the Legal Entities used by the Profit Centers shall be entirely disregarded for all purposes of this Agreement.

^the amount actually paid or payable by a Reassured, (and also including but not limited to all allocated loss adjustment expenses, [attorney’s fees, subrogation expenses and other costs of investigation or litigation], and unallocated loss adjustment expenses calculated at [[Percentage 5: Number]]% of any loss) in settlement or payment of claims or judgements arising from loss occurrences for which a Reassured is or may be found liable under their respective policies.

^any salvage and subrogation recoveries, including any amounts recoverable under reinsurances which inure to the benefit of this Agreement, shall be first deducted from such loss to arrive at the amount of liability, if any, attaching hereunder.

^^^^^ 
Agreement and the FHFC, and such recoveries, together with any other reinsurance recoveries made by the Reassured applicable to said Loss Occurrence(s), exceed the amount permitted by Florida law, any amount in excess thereof shall reduce the Ultimate Net Loss subject to this Agreement for the Loss Occurrence(s) to which the recoveries apply.

For purposes hereof, if a loss reimbursement received by the Reassured under the FHCF is based on the Reassured’s losses in more than one Loss Occurrence and the FHCF does not designate the amount allocable to each such Loss Occurrence, the reimbursement shall be prorated in the proportion that the Reassured’s losses in each such Loss Occurrence bear to the Reassured’s total losses arising out of all Loss Occurrences to which the recovery applies.

^Recoveries under any other property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreements or aggregate property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement, shall be disregarded in arriving at the Ultimate Net Loss under this Agreement.

^Whenever the Reassured issues a lost instrument bond or a lost instrument letter of indemnity for salvage purposes or in lieu of loss payment under its policy, the Reinsurer agrees to accept liability under such bond or letter of indemnity in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

^The Reassured shall advise the Reinsurer promptly, but in no event later than 30 days, of all losses which, in the opinion of the Reassured, may result in a claim hereunder and of all subsequent developments thereto which, in the opinion of the Reassured, may materially affect the position of the Reinsurer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Reassured shall give notice to the Reinsurer once a claim exceeds or has the potential to exceed the retention.

^All loss settlements made by the Reassured, provided they are within the terms of this Agreement, shall be unconditionally binding upon the Reinsurer, who agrees to pay all amounts for which it may be liable immediately, but in no event later than 30 days, upon being furnished by the Reassured with reasonable evidence of the amount due.

^SEVERABILITY PROVISION  
If any provision of this Agreement shall be rendered illegal or unenforceable by the laws, regulations or public policy of any state, such provision shall be considered void in such state, but this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this

^^^^^ 
Agreement or the enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

^ERRORS AND OMISSIONS  
Inadvertent delays, errors or omissions made by the Reassured in connection with this Agreement shall not relieve the Reinsurer from any liability which would have attached had such delay, error or omission not occurred, provided always that such delay, error or omission shall be rectified as soon as possible after discovery by the Reassured.

^TAXES

The Reinsurer shall allow for the purpose of paying Federal Excise Tax the applicable percentage of the premium payable hereon (as imposed under Section 4371 of the Internal Revenue Code) to the extent such premium is subject to such tax.

The Reassured shall place at the disposal of the Reinsurer at all reasonable times, and the Reinsurer shall have the right to inspect through its designated representatives, during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, all books, records and papers of the Reassured in connection with any reinsurance hereunder, or the subject matter hereof.

^ARBITRATION  
^Any dispute or other matter in question between the Reassured and the Reinsurer arising out of, or relating to, the formation, interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement, whether such dispute arises before or after termination of this Agreement, shall be settled by arbitration. Arbitration shall be initiated by the delivery of a written notice of demand for arbitration by one party to the other within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen.

^If more than one reinsurer is involved in the same dispute, all such reinsurers shall constitute and act as one party for the purposes of this Article, provided, however, that nothing herein shall impair the rights of such reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint, defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing the liability of the Reinsurers under the terms of this Agreement from several to joint.

^Each party shall appoint an individual as arbitrator and the two so appointed shall

^^^^^ 
then appoint a third arbitrator. If either party refuses or neglects to appoint an arbitrator within sixty (60) days, the other party may appoint the second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators do not agree on a third arbitrator within sixty (60) days of their appointment, each of the arbitrators shall nominate three individuals. Each arbitrator shall then decline two of the nominations presented by the other arbitrator. The third arbitrator shall then be chosen from the remaining two nominations by drawing lots. The arbitrators shall be active or retired officers of insurance or reinsurance companies; the arbitrators shall not have a personal or financial interest in the result of the arbitration.

^The arbitration hearings shall be held in Boston, Massachusetts, or such other place as may be mutually agreed. Each party shall submit its case to the arbitrators within sixty (60) days of the selection of the third arbitrator or within such longer period as may be agreed by the arbitrators. The arbitrators shall not be obliged to follow judicial formalities or the rules of evidence except to the extent required by governing law, that is, the state law of the situs of the arbitration as herein agreed; they shall make their decisions according to the practice of the reinsurance business. The decision rendered by a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on both parties. Such decision shall be a condition precedent to any right of legal action arising out of the arbitrated dispute which either party may have against the other. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

^Each party shall pay the fee and expenses of its own arbitrator and one-half of the fee and expenses of the third arbitrator. All other expenses of the arbitration shall be equally divided between the parties.

^Except as provided above, arbitration shall be based, insofar as applicable, upon the procedures of the American Arbitration Association.

^SERVICE OF SUIT  
(This article applies to other than authorized Reinsurers and to Reinsurers who are domiciled outside the United States of America.)

This Service of Suit Article will not be read to conflict with or override the obligations of the parties to arbitrate their disputes as provided for in the Arbitration Article. This Article is intended as an aid to compelling arbitration or enforcing such arbitration or arbitral award, not as an alternative to the Arbitration Article for resolving disputes arising out of this Agreement.

In the event of the failure of the Reinsurer to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, the Reinsurer, at the request of the Reassured, will submit to the jurisdiction of a Court of competent jurisdiction within the United States. Nothing in this Article constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of the Reinsurers’ rights to commence an action in any Court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another Court as permitted by the laws of the United States or of any state in the United States. The Reinsurer, once the appropriate Court is selected, whether such court is the one originally chosen by the Reassured and

^^^^^ 
accepted by Reinsurer or is determined by removal, transfer, or otherwise, as provided for above, will comply with all requirements necessary to give said Court jurisdiction and, in any suit instituted against any of them upon this Agreement, will abide by the final decision of such Court or of any Appellate Court in the event of an appeal.

Service of process in such suit may be made upon **Mendes & Mount, LLP, 750 7**th** Avenue, [[Address 1: Address]]-6829.**

The above-named are authorized and directed to accept service of process on behalf of the Reinsurer in any such suit.

Further, pursuant to any statute of any state, territory or district of the United States that makes provision therefor, the Reinsurer hereby designate the Superintendent, Commissioner or Director of Insurance, or other officer specified for that purpose in the statute, or his successor or successors in office, as their true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceedings instituted by or on behalf of the Reassured or any beneficiary hereunder arising out of this Agreement, and hereby designate the above-named as the person to whom the said officer is authorized to mail such process or a true copy thereof.

^SPECIAL CONDITIONS  
The Reassured may terminate this Agreement at any time by the giving of 30 days notice in writing to the Reinsurer upon the happening of any one of the following circumstances:

^A State Insurance Department or other legal authority orders the Reinsurer to cease writing business; or

^The Reinsurer has become insolvent or has been placed into liquidation or receivership (whether voluntary or involuntary), or there have been instituted against it proceedings for the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, rehabilitator, conservator, trustee in bankruptcy or other agent known by whatever name, to take possession of its assets or control of its operations; or

^The Reinsurer’s policyholders’ surplus has been reduced by [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of the amount of surplus at the inception of this Agreement; or

^The Reinsurer has become merged with, acquired or controlled by any company, corporation or individual(s) not controlling the Reinsurer’s operations at the inception of this Agreement.

^The Reinsurer’s A.M. Best Rating has been assigned or downgraded below A- or Standard and Poor’s rating has been assigned or downgraded below A-.

The coverage afforded by this Agreement shall cease as of the date of termination and the Reinsurer shall return the unearned premium net of ceding commission, if any. If coverage hereunder terminates while a claim covered by this Agreement is in progress, the Reinsurer shall be liable subject to all other conditions hereof for its proportion of the entire claim, provided that the event giving rise to the claim started before such termination.

^^^^^ 
If the Reassured chooses to effect termination, it shall have the option to commute the Reinsurer’s liability for loss(es), whether reported or unreported, on policies covered by this Agreement as of the effective date of termination. The Reassured shall submit a statement of valuation of the outstanding claim or claims showing the elements considered reasonable to establish the “ultimate net loss,” and the Reinsurer shall pay the amount requested. In the event the Reassured and the Reinsurer cannot agree on the statement of valuation of the Reinsurer’s liability under such policies, either party may request in writing that the differences be settled by a panel of three actuaries. Each party shall appoint an actuary to assess such liability within 15 days after receipt of the written request for commutation. Upon such appointment, the two actuaries shall appoint a third actuary.

^^^^^ 
may interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses which it may deem available to the Reassured or its conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be payable subject to court approval out of the estate of the insolvent Reassured as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the Reassured in conservation or liquidation, solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer.

^OFFSET
