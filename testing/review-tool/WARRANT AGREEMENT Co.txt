The Company hereby appoints the Warrant Agent to act as warrant agent for the Company in accordance with the express (and no implied) instructions set forth hereinafter in this Warrant Agreement, and the Warrant Agent hereby accepts such appointment, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. 

^Issuance of Warrants. 

On the Effective Date or a date that is as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, Warrants will be issued by the Company in the amounts and to the recipients specified in the Plan. In accordance with Section 6 hereof and the Plan, the Company will cause to be issued to the Depository (as defined below), one or more Global Warrant Certificates (as defined below) evidencing a portion of the Warrants. The remainder of the Warrants shall be issued by book-entry registration on the books of the Warrant Agent (“**Book-Entry Warrants**”) and shall be evidenced by statements issued by the Warrant Agent from time to time to the registered holder of book-entry Warrants reflecting such book-entry position (the “**Warrant Statement**”). Each Warrant evidenced thereby entitles the holder, upon proper exercise and payment of the applicable Exercise Price, to receive from the Company, as adjusted as provided herein, one share of Common Stock at the Exercise Price. The shares of Common Stock or (as provided pursuant to Section 13 or Section 14 hereof) other shares of capital stock deliverable upon proper exercise of the Warrants are referred to herein as the “**Warrant Shares**.” The words “**holders**” or “**holder**,” as used herein in respect of any Warrants or Warrant Shares, shall mean the registered holder or registered holders thereof. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Warrant Agreement shall be [[Shares 1]] shares, as such amount is adjusted from time to time pursuant to Section 13 or Section 14 hereof. 

^Warrant Certificates. 

Subject to Section 7 of this Warrant Agreement, the Warrants shall be issued (1) via book-entry registration on the books and records of the Warrant Agent and evidenced by the Warrant Statements, in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto, and/or (2) in the form of one or more global certificates (the “**Global Warrant Certificates**”), the forms of election to exercise and of assignment to be printed on the reverse thereof, in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto. The Warrant Statements and Global Warrant Certificates may bear such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Warrant Agreement, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with any law or with any rules made pursuant thereto or with any rules of any securities exchange or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by (i) in the case of Global Warrant Certificates, the Appropriate Officers (as hereinafter defined) executing such Global Warrant Certificates, as evidenced by their execution of the Global Warrant Certificates, or (ii) in the case of a Warrant Statement, any Appropriate Officer, and all of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Warrant Agent. The Global Warrant Certificates shall be deposited on or after the date hereof with, or with the Warrant Agent as custodian for, The Depository Trust Company (the “**Depository**”) and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as the Depository’s nominee. Each Global Warrant Certificate shall represent such number of the outstanding Warrants as specified therein, and each shall provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of outstanding Warrants from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of outstanding Warrants represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased, as appropriate, in accordance with the terms of this Warrant Agreement. 

^Execution of Global Warrant Certificates. 

Global Warrant Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or Treasurer (each, an “**Appropriate Officer**”), and by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary. Each such signature upon the Global Warrant Certificates may be in the form of a facsimile signature of any such Appropriate Officer, Secretary, and any Assistant Secretary and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Global Warrant Certificates and for that purpose the Company may adopt and use the facsimile signature of any Appropriate Officer, Secretary, and any Assistant Secretary who shall have been an Appropriate Officer, Secretary, or an Assistant Secretary at the time of entering into this Warrant Agreement. If any Appropriate Officer, Secretary, or any Assistant Secretary who shall have signed any of the Global Warrant Certificates shall cease to be such Appropriate Officer, Secretary, or an Assistant Secretary before the Global Warrant Certificates so signed shall have been countersigned by the Warrant Agent or disposed of by the Company, such Global Warrant Certificates nevertheless may be countersigned and delivered or disposed of as though such Appropriate Officer, Secretary, or Assistant Secretary had not ceased to be such Appropriate Officer, Secretary, or Assistant Secretary of the Company; and any Global Warrant Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any person who, at the actual date of the execution of such Global Warrant Certificate, shall be a proper Appropriate Officer, Secretary, or Assistant Secretary of the Company to sign such Global Warrant Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Warrant Agreement any such person was not such Appropriate Officer, Secretary, or Assistant Secretary. 

Global Warrant Certificates shall be dated the date of countersignature by the Warrant Agent and shall represent one or more whole Warrants. 

^Registration and Countersignature. 

The Warrant Agent, on behalf of the Company, shall (i) register in the Warrant Register (as defined below) the Book-Entry Warrants and (ii) upon receipt of the Global Warrant Certificates duly executed on behalf of the Company, countersign one or more Global Warrant Certificates evidencing Warrants and shall deliver such Global Warrant Certificates to or upon the written order of the Company. Such written order of the Company shall specifically state the number of Warrants that are to be issued as Book-Entry Warrants and the number of Warrants that are to be issued as a Global Warrant Certificate. A Global Warrant Certificate shall be, and shall remain, subject to the provisions of this Warrant Agreement until such time as all of the Warrants evidenced thereby shall have been duly exercised or shall have expired or been canceled in accordance with the terms hereof. Each holder of Warrants shall be bound by all of the terms and provisions of the Warrant Agreement (a copy of which is available on request to the Secretary of the Company) and any amendments thereto as fully and effectively as if such holder had signed the same. 

No Global Warrant Certificate shall be valid for any purpose, and no Warrant evidenced thereby shall be exercisable, until such Global Warrant Certificate has been countersigned by the manual signature of the Warrant Agent. Such signature by the Warrant Agent upon any Global Warrant Certificate executed by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that such Global Warrant Certificate so countersigned has been duly issued hereunder. 

The Warrant Agent shall keep, at an office designated for such purpose, books (the “**Warrant Register**”) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it shall register the Book-Entry Warrants as well as any Global Warrant Certificates and exchanges and transfers of outstanding Warrants in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 7 of this Warrant Agreement, all in form satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent. No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of the Warrants, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed on the holder of the Warrant in connection with any such exchange or registration of transfer. The Warrant Agent shall have no obligation to effect an exchange or register a transfer unless and until any payments required by the immediately preceding sentence have been made. 

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer or exchange of any Warrant in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Warrant Agreement, the Warrant Agent and the Company may deem and treat the person in whose name any Warrant is registered as the absolute owner of such Warrant (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing made in a Global Warrant Certificate by anyone), for the purpose of any exercise thereof, any distribution to the holder of the Warrant thereof and for all other purposes, and neither the Warrant Agent nor the Company shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 

^Registration of Transfers and Exchanges. 

^^Transfer and Exchange of Global Warrant Certificates or Beneficial Interests Therein. The transfer and exchange of Global Warrant Certificates or beneficial interests therein shall be effected through the Depository, in accordance with this Warrant Agreement and the procedures of the Depository therefor. 

^^Exchange of a Beneficial Interest in a Global Warrant Certificate for Book-Entry Warrants. 

^^^Any holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Warrant Certificate may, upon request, exchange such beneficial interest for a Book-Entry Warrant. Upon receipt by the Warrant Agent from the Depository or its nominee of written instructions or such other form of instructions as is customary for the Depository on behalf of any person having a beneficial interest in a Global Warrant Certificate, the Warrant Agent shall cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depository and the Warrant Agent, the number of Warrants represented by the Global Warrant Certificate to be reduced by the number of Warrants to be represented by the Book-Entry Warrants to be issued in exchange for the beneficial interest of such person in the Global Warrant Certificate and, following such reduction, the Warrant Agent shall register in the name of the holder a Book-Entry Warrant and deliver to said Warrant holder a Warrant Statement. 

^^^Book-Entry Warrants issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in a Global Warrant Certificate pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall be registered in such names as the Depository, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent shall deliver such Warrant Statements to the persons in whose names such Warrants are so registered. 

^^Transfer and Exchange of Book-Entry Warrants. Book-Entry Warrants surrendered for exchange or for registration of transfer pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 7(c) or Section 7(h)(v) hereof shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent. When Book-Entry Warrants are presented to or deposited with the Warrant Agent with a written request: 

^^^to register the transfer of the Book-Entry Warrants; or 

^^^to exchange such Book-Entry Warrants for an equal number of Book-Entry Warrants of other authorized denominations, 

the Warrant Agent shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its requirements for such transactions are met, provided that the Warrant Agent has received a written instruction of transfer in form satisfactory to the Warrant Agent, duly executed by the holder thereof or the duly appointed legal representative thereof or by his attorney, duly authorized in writing. 

^^Restrictions on Exchange or Transfer of a Book-Entry Warrant for a Beneficial Interest in a Global Warrant Certificate. A Book-Entry Warrant may not be exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Warrant Certificate except upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth in this Section 7(d). Upon receipt by the Warrant Agent of appropriate instruments of transfer with respect to a Book-Entry Warrant, in form satisfactory to the Warrant Agent, together with written instructions directing the Warrant Agent to make, or to direct the Depository to make, an endorsement on the Global Warrant Certificate to reflect an increase in the number of Warrants represented by the Global Warrant Certificate equal to the number of Warrants represented by such Book-Entry Warrant (such instruments of transfer and instructions to be duly executed by the holder hereof or the duly appointed legal representative thereof or by his attorney, duly authorized in writing, such signatures to be guaranteed by an eligible guarantor institution), then the Warrant Agent shall cancel such Book-Entry Warrant on the Warrant Register and cause, or direct the Depository to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depository and the Warrant Agent, the number of Warrants represented by the Global Warrant Certificate to be increased accordingly. If no Global Warrant Certificates are then outstanding, the Company shall issue, and the Warrant Agent shall countersign, a new Global Warrant Certificate representing the appropriate number of Warrants. 

^^Restrictions on Transfer and Exchange of Global Warrant Certificates. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Warrant Agreement (other than the provisions set forth in Section 7(f)), unless and until it is exchanged in whole for a Book-Entry Warrant, a Global Warrant Certificate may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor Depository or a nominee of such successor Depository. 

^^Book-Entry Warrants. If at any time: 

^^^the Depository for the Global Warrant Certificates notifies the Company that the Depository is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for the Global Warrant Certificates and a successor Depository for the Global Warrant Certificates is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after delivery of such notice; or 

^^^the Company, in its sole discretion, notifies the Warrant Agent in writing that it elects to exclusively cause the issuance of Book-Entry Warrants under this Warrant Agreement; 

then the Warrant Agent, upon written instructions signed by an Appropriate Officer of the Company, shall register Book-Entry Warrants, in an aggregate number equal to the number of Warrants represented by the Global Warrant Certificates, in exchange for such Global Warrant Certificates, in such names and in such amounts as directed by the Depository or, in the absence of instructions from the Depository, the Company. 

^^Cancellation of Global Warrant Certificate. At such time as all beneficial interests in Global Warrant Certificates have either been exchanged for Book-Entry Warrants, redeemed, repurchased or cancelled, all Global Warrant Certificates shall be returned to, or cancelled and retained pursuant to applicable law by, the Warrant Agent, upon written instructions from the Company reasonably satisfactory to the Warrant Agent. 

^^Obligations with Respect to Transfers and Exchanges of Warrants. 

^^^To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Warrant Agent is hereby authorized to countersign, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 hereof and this Section 7, Global Warrant Certificates, if applicable, or register Book-Entry Warrants, if applicable, as required pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7 and for the purpose of any distribution of additional Global Warrant Certificates contemplated by Section 13 or Section 14 hereof. 

^^^All Book-Entry Warrants and Global Warrant Certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Book-Entry Warrants or Global Warrant Certificates shall be the valid obligations of the Company, entitled to the same benefits under this Warrant Agreement as the Book-Entry Warrants or Global Warrant Certificates surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. 

^^^No service charge shall be made to a holder of Warrants for any registration, transfer or exchange but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed on the holder in connection with any such exchange or registration of transfer. 

^^^So long as the Depository, or its nominee, is the registered owner of a Global Warrant Certificate, the Depository or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Warrants represented by such Global Warrant Certificate for all purposes under this Warrant Agreement. Except as provided in Section 7(b) and Section 7(f) hereof, upon the exchange of a beneficial interest in a Global Warrant Certificate for Book-Entry Warrants, owners of beneficial interests in a Global Warrant Certificate will not be entitled to have any Warrants registered in their names, and will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of any such Warrants and will not be considered the owners or holders thereof under the Warrants or this Warrant Agreement. Neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent, in its capacity as registrar for such Warrants, will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to beneficial interests in a Global Warrant Certificate or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial interests. 

^^^Subject to Section 7(b), Section 7(c), Section 7(d) hereof and this Section 7(h), the Warrant Agent shall, upon receipt of all information required to be delivered hereunder, from time to time register the transfer of any outstanding Warrants in the Warrant Register, upon surrender of Global Warrant Certificates, if applicable, representing such Warrants at the Warrant Agent Office referred to in Section 24 hereof (the “**Warrant Agent Office**”), duly endorsed, and accompanied by a completed form of assignment substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto (or with respect to a Book-Entry Warrant, only such completed form of assignment substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto), duly signed by the holder thereof or by the duly appointed legal representative thereof or by his attorney, duly authorized in writing, such signature to be guaranteed by any participant in the Securities Transfer Agent Medallion Program, the Stock Exchanges Medallion Program or the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Medallion Signature Program. Upon any such registration of transfer, a new Global Warrant Certificate or a Warrant Statement, as the case may be, shall be issued to the transferee. 

^Securities Law Compliance. 

The Warrants (including any Warrant Shares issued upon exercise thereof) were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirement of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code, and to the extent that a Warrant holder is an “underwriter” as defined in Section 1145(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, such holder may not be able to sell or transfer any Warrants or Warrant Shares in the absence of an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration thereunder. 

^Terms of Warrants; Exercise of Warrants. 

^^Subject to the terms of this Warrant Agreement, including Section 14(d) hereof, each Warrant holder shall have the right, which may be exercised in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, beginning on the date of original issuance of the Warrant pursuant to the terms of this Warrant Agreement and ending at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [[Date 3: Date]] (the “**Expiration Date**”), to exercise each Warrant and receive from the Company the number of fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares which the holder may at the time be entitled to receive on exercise of such Warrants and payment of the aggregate Exercise Price then in effect for such Warrant Shares. The Company shall promptly provide the Warrant Agent with written notice of the Expiration Date. After 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date, the Warrants will become wholly void and of no value. Any shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of any Warrants shall be shares of Class A Common Stock, unless such exercising holder elects in writing at the time it delivers the Warrant Exercise Notice (as defined below) to the Warrant Agent to receive shares of Class B Common Stock. In addition, prior to the delivery of any shares of Common Stock that the Company shall be obligated to deliver upon proper exercise of the Warrants, the Company shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations which require action to be taken by the Company. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the holder may exercise the Warrants by: 

^^^providing written notice of such election (“**Warrant Exercise Notice**”) to exercise the Warrant to the Company and the Warrant Agent at the addresses set forth in Section 24 no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date, which Warrant Exercise Notice shall be substantially in the form set forth either (x) in Exhibit A hereto, properly completed and executed by the holder provided that such written notice may only be submitted by persons who hold Book-Entry Warrants, or (y) in Exhibit B hereto, properly completed and executed by the holder, provided that such written notice may only be submitted with respect to Warrants held through the book-entry facilities of the Depository, by or through persons that are direct participants in the Depository; 

^^^delivering no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately prior to the Settlement Date, such Warrants to the Warrant Agent by book-entry transfer through the facilities of the Depository, if such Warrants are represented by a Global Warrant Certificate; and 

^^^paying (x) the applicable Exercise Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock in respect of which any Warrants are being exercised or (y) in the case of a Cashless Exercise, paying the required consideration in the manner set forth in Section 9(b), in each case, together with any applicable taxes and governmental charges. 

To the extent a Warrant Exercise Notice is delivered in respect of a Warrant no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date, but the deliveries and payments specified in clause (ii) and (iii) above are effected thereafter but no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately preceding the Settlement Date, the Warrants shall nonetheless be deemed exercised prior to the Expiration Date for the purposes of this Warrant Agreement. 

^^Provided the Common Stock is then listed or admitted for trading on a national securities exchange or an over-the-counter market or comparable system, and subject to the provisions of this Warrant Agreement, the holder shall have the right, in lieu of paying the Exercise Price in cash, to instruct the Company to reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of the Warrants (the “**Cashless Exercise**”) in accordance with the following formula: 

^=      \centered P
^where: 

^= the number of shares of Common Stock to be subtracted from the remaining number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants; 

^= the Exercise Price which would otherwise be payable in cash for the shares of Common Stock for which the Warrants are being exercised; and 

^= the Market Price of a share of Common Stock determined as of the day immediately preceding the day the Warrant Exercise Notice is delivered to the Warrant Agent. 

If the foregoing calculation results in a negative number, then no shares of Common Stock will be issuable via the Cashless Exercise. The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued on such exercise will be determined by the Company (with written notice thereof to the Warrant Agent) using the formula set forth in this Section 9(b). The Warrant Agent shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or confirm whether the Company’s determination of the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued on such exercise, pursuant to this Section 9(b), is accurate or correct. 

^^Subject to the adjustments set forth in Section 13 and Section 14 hereof, each Warrant, when exercised, will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at the Exercise Price then in effect for such share of Common Stock. Each Warrant not exercised pursuant to this Warrant Agreement prior to the Expiration Date shall become void and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect thereof under this Warrant Agreement shall cease as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date. 

^^The Exercise Price shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America either by certified or official bank or bank cashier’s check made payable to the order of the Company (or if agreed to in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account arranged with the Company prior to exercise). 

^^Any exercise of a Warrant pursuant to the terms of this Warrant Agreement shall be irrevocable and shall constitute a binding agreement between the holder and the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms. 

^^The Warrant Agent shall: 

^^^examine all Warrant Exercise Notices and all other documents delivered to it by or on behalf of holders as contemplated hereunder to ascertain whether, on their face, such Warrant Exercise Notices and any such other documents have been executed and completed in accordance with their terms; 

^^^where a Warrant Exercise Notice or other document appears on its face to have been improperly completed or executed or some other irregularity in connection with the exercise of the Warrant exists, the Warrant Agent shall endeavor to inform the appropriate parties (including the person submitting such instrument) of the need for fulfillment of all requirements, specifying those requirements which appear to be unfulfilled; 

^^^inform the Company of and cooperate with and assist the Company in resolving any reconciliation problems between the Warrant Exercise Notices received and delivery of Warrants to the Warrant Agent’s account; 

^^^advise the Company, no later than three business days after receipt of a Warrant Exercise Notice, of (x) the receipt of such Warrant Exercise Notice and the number of Warrants exercised in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Warrant Agreement, (y) the instructions with respect to delivery of the shares of Common Stock of the Company deliverable upon such exercise, subject to the timely receipt from the Depository of the necessary information, and (z) such other information as the Company shall reasonably require; 

^^^subject to the Common Stock being made available to the Warrant Agent by or on behalf of the Company for delivery to the Depository, liaise with the Depository and endeavor to effect such delivery to the relevant accounts at the Depository in accordance with its requirements; and 

^^^pay to the Company all funds received by the Warrant Agent in payment of the aggregate Exercise Price. 

^^All questions as to the validity, form and sufficiency (including time of receipt) of a Warrant exercise shall be determined by the Company in its sole discretion, which determination shall be final and binding. The Warrant Agent shall incur no liability for or in respect of and, except to the extent such liability arises from the Warrant Agent’s negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company for acting or refraining from acting upon, or as a result of such determination by the Company. The Company reserves the right to reject any and all Warrant Exercise Notices not in proper form or for which any corresponding agreement by the Company to exchange would, in the opinion of the Company, be unlawful. Such determination by the Company shall be final and binding on the holders, absent manifest error. Moreover, the Company reserves the absolute right to waive any of the conditions to the exercise of Warrants or defects in Warrant Exercise Notices with regard to any particular exercise of Warrants. Neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be under any duty to give notice to the holders of the Warrants of any irregularities in any exercise of Warrants, nor shall it incur any liability for the failure to give such notice. 

^^As soon as reasonably practicable after the exercise of any Warrant (and any event not later than 10 business days thereafter), the Company shall issue, or otherwise deliver, in authorized denominations to or upon the order of the holder of the Warrants, either: 

^^^if such holder holds the Warrants being exercised through the Depository’s book-entry transfer facilities, by same-day or next-day credit to the Depository for the account of such holder or for the account of a participant in the Depository the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled, in each case registered in such name and delivered to such account as directed in the Warrant Exercise Notice by such holder or by the direct participant in the Depository through which such holder is acting; or 

^^^if such holder holds the Warrants being exercised in the form of Book-Entry Warrants, a book-entry interest in the shares of Common Stock registered on the books of the transfer agent for the Company’s Common Stock (such agent, in such capacity, as may from time to time be appointed by the Company, the “**Transfer Agent**”) or, at the Company’s option, by delivery to the address designated by such holder in its Warrant Exercise Notice of a physical certificate or certificates representing the number of Warrant Shares to which such holder is entitled, in fully registered form, registered in such name or names as may be directed by such holder. Such Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such Warrant Shares as of the close of business on the date of the delivery thereof. 

If less than all of the Warrants evidenced by a Global Warrant Certificate surrendered upon the exercise of Warrants are exercised at any time prior to the Expiration Date, a new Global Warrant Certificate or Certificates shall be issued for the remaining number of Warrants evidenced by the Global Warrant Certificate so surrendered, and the Warrant Agent is hereby authorized to countersign the required new Global Warrant Certificate or Certificates pursuant to the provisions of Section 6 hereof and this Section 9. The Person in whose name any certificate or certificates for the Warrant Shares are to be issued (or such Warrant Shares are to be registered, in the case of a book-entry transfer) upon exercise of a Warrant shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of such Warrant Shares on the date such Warrant Exercise Notice is delivered. 

^^As provided in Section 16 hereof, no fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon exercise of any Warrants. 

^^All Global Warrant Certificates surrendered upon exercise of Warrants shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent. Such cancelled Global Warrant Certificates shall then be disposed of by or at the direction of the Company in accordance with applicable law. The Warrant Agent shall (x) advise an authorized representative of the Company as directed by the Company by the end of each day or on the next business day following each day on which Warrants were exercised, of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of a Warrant, (ii) the delivery of Global Warrant Certificates evidencing the balance, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable after such exercise of the Warrant and (iii) such other information as the Company shall reasonably require and (y) concurrently pay to the Company all funds received by the Warrant Agent in payment of the aggregate Exercise Price. The Warrant Agent promptly shall confirm such information to the Company in writing. 

^^The Warrant Agent shall keep copies of this Warrant Agreement and any notices given or received hereunder. 

^Payment of Taxes. 

No service charge shall be made to any holder of a Warrant for any exercise, exchange or registration of transfer of Warrants, and the Company will pay all documentary stamp taxes attributable to the initial issuance of Warrant Shares upon the exercise of Warrants; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance of Warrants or any certificates for Warrant Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of a Warrant surrendered upon the exercise of a Warrant, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such Warrants or the certificates representing the Warrant Shares unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. The Warrant Agent shall have no duty under to deliver such Warrants or the certificates representing such Warrant Shares unless and until it is satisfied that all such taxes and charges have been paid. 

^Mutilated or Missing Global Warrant Certificates. 

On receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Global Warrant Certificate and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, on delivery of an affidavit or an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company and the Warrant Agent and, if requested by either the Company or the Warrant Agent, the posting of an indemnity or a bond, also reasonably satisfactory to them, or, in the case of mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of a Global Warrant Certificate, the Company shall issue and the Warrant Agent shall countersign and deliver, in lieu of the Global Warrant Certificate, a new warrant certificate of like tenor and amount. 

^Reservation of Shares of Common Stock. 

The Company will at all times through the Expiration Date reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue shares of Common Stock upon exercise of Warrants, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may then be deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding Warrants, and the Transfer Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized and unissued or treasury shares of Common Stock as shall be required for such purpose. The Company will keep a copy of this Warrant Agreement on file with such Transfer Agent and with every transfer agent for any Shares issuable upon the exercise of Warrants pursuant to Section 9. The Warrant Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to requisition from time to time from such Transfer Agent stock certificates issuable upon exercise of outstanding Warrants, and the Company will supply such Transfer Agent with duly executed stock certificates for such purpose. The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon exercise of Warrants will be, upon payment of the aggregate Exercise Price and issuance thereof (in the case of an exercise), fully paid, nonassessable, free of preemptive rights and free from all taxes, liens, charges and security interests with respect to the issue thereof (other than any liens, charges and security interests created by the Warrant holder or the person to which the shares of Common Stock are to be issued). 

^Adjustment of Exercise Price and Number of Shares of Common Stock Issuable. 

The Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant are subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of the events enumerated in this Section 13, without duplication. 

^^Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock. If the Company, at any time or from time to time while any Warrant is outstanding: 

^^^pays a dividend in shares of Common Stock or makes a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock; 

^^^subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares (other than upon a reclassification to which clause (v) of this Section 13(a) or Section 13(j) hereof applies); 

^^^combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares (other than upon a reclassification to which clause (v) of this Section 13(a) or Section 13(j) hereof applies); 

^^^makes a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its capital stock other than Common Stock; or 

^^issues by reclassification of its Common Stock any shares of its capital stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger of the Company in which the Company is the surviving entity but excluding any reclassification in which property other than shares of capital stock is issued (in which event Section 14 hereof shall apply)), then the number of shares of Common Stock or other shares of capital stock of the Company receivable upon exercise of each Warrant immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the holder of each Warrant shall be entitled upon exercise to receive the kind and number of shares of Common Stock or other shares of capital stock of the Company that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of any of the events described above, had such Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the happening of such event or any record date with respect thereto. An adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (a) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such event retroactive to the record date, if any, for such event. 

^^Adjustment of Exercise Price. Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock or other shares of capital stock of the Company receivable upon the exercise of any Warrant is otherwise required to be adjusted as herein provided, the Exercise Price payable per share of Common Stock upon exercise of such Warrant shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock receivable upon the exercise of such Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (or, where clause (iv) or (v) of Section 13(a) hereof applies and shares of capital stock (other than solely Common Stock) become so receivable, the number of shares of Common Stock equivalent to such shares of capital stock based on the relative Market Price thereof) so receivable immediately thereafter. 

If after an adjustment a holder of a Warrant upon exercise thereof may receive shares of two or more classes or series of capital stock of the Company, the Board of Directors, in good faith, shall determine as the adjusted Exercise Price for each share of capital stock (other than Common Stock) so receivable an amount equal to the Exercise Price per share of Common Stock as adjusted pursuant to the preceding paragraph, multiplied by a fraction the denominator of which is the Market Price of a share of Common Stock and the numerator of which is the Market Price of such share of other capital stock. After such allocation, the exercise privilege and the Exercise Price of each class or series of capital stock shall thereafter again be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to shares of Common Stock in this Section 13 and Section 14. 

^^Adjustments for Distributions of Cash or Assets, Etc. If the Company, at any time or from time to time while any Warrant is outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of Common Stock (including any such distribution made to the stockholders of the Company in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation) evidences of its indebtedness, cash or assets (other than (i) distributions and dividends payable in shares of Common Stock or (ii) ordinary cash dividends paid ratably to all holders of Common Stock), then, in each case, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Market Price per share of Common Stock on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined by an Independent Appraiser) of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness or assets so to be distributed, applicable to one share of Common Stock, and the denominator of which shall be such Market Price per share of Common Stock. 

^^Issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents Below Market Price. If the Company, at any time or from time to time while any Warrant is outstanding, shall offer to all holders of Common Stock the right to purchase (i) Additional Shares of Common Stock, at a price per share less than [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of the then current Market Price, or (ii) any Common Stock Equivalent and the price per share for which Additional Shares of Common Stock may be issuable thereafter pursuant to such Common Stock Equivalent plus the price payable for such Common Stock Equivalent shall be less than [[Percentage 4]]% of the then current Market Price, then each holder of Warrants shall have the right to participate, on an as exercised basis, in any such offering pro rata with the holders of Common Stock. The “then Current Market Price” with respect to any offer of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalent shall be determined for purposes of this Section 13(d) as of the trading day immediately preceding the public announcement of the offer. 

^^When De Minimis Adjustment May Be Deferred. No adjustment in the Exercise Price need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent ([[Percentage 5: Number]]%) in the Exercise Price. Any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 13 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. 

^^When No Adjustment Required. 

^^^No adjustment need be made pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 13(b) hereof for a transaction referred to in Section 13(a) hereof if Warrant holders participate in such transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors determines in good faith to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction. 

^^^No adjustment need be made for any issuance of securities by the Company on the Effective Date of the Plan or pursuant to the Plan. 

^^^No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock. 

^^^Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, no adjustment to the Exercise Price shall result in zero or in a negative number. To the extent the Warrants become exercisable into cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash. Interest will not accrue on the cash. 

^^Notice of Certain Transactions. If: 

^^^the Company takes any action that would require an adjustment to the Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock or other shares of capital stock receivable upon exercise of Warrants pursuant to this Section 13 or Section 14; 

^^^the Company determines to adjust the number of Warrants pursuant to Section 13(e) hereof; or 

^^^there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, 

the Company shall mail to Warrant holders a notice stating the proposed record date for a dividend or distribution or the proposed effective date of a subdivision, combination, reclassification, consolidation, merger, liquidation or dissolution or other transaction resulting in an adjustment hereunder. The Company shall mail the notice at least fifteen (15) days before such date. Failure to mail the notice or any defect in it shall not affect the validity of the transaction. 

Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted, the Company also shall provide the notices in accordance with Section 24 hereof. 

^^Company Determination Final. Any determination that the Company or the Board of Directors must make pursuant to this Section 13 is (absent manifest error) conclusive if such determination is made in good faith and in accordance with the provisions of this Warrant Agreement. 

^^Warrant Agent’s Disclaimer. The Company shall promptly provide the Warrant Agent with written notice of any adjustment pursuant to this Section 13. The Warrant Agent shall be fully protected in relying on such written notice and on any adjustment or statement contained therein. The Warrant Agent (if not the Company) has no duty to determine when an adjustment under this Section 13 should be made (if at all), how it should be made or what it should be. The Warrant Agent makes no representation as to the validity or value of any securities or assets issued upon exercise of Warrants. The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for the Company’s failure to comply with this Section 13. The Warrant Agent shall have no duty or liability with respect to, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment under this Section 13 until it has received written notice thereof pursuant to this Section 13. 

^^Optional Tax Adjustment. The Company may at its option, at any time prior to the Expiration Date, increase the number of shares of Common Stock or other shares of capital stock into which each Warrant is exercisable, or decrease the Exercise Price, in addition to those changes required by Section 13(a) and Section 13(b) hereof, as deemed advisable by the Board of Directors, in order that any event treated for federal income tax purposes as a dividend of stock or stock rights shall not be taxable to the recipients. 

^Change of Control. 

^^Any recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets or other transaction, in each case which is effected at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Expiration Date in such a way that the holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities and/or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock is referred to herein as an “**Organic Change**.” Prior to the consummation of any Organic Change, the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that each of the registered holders of Warrants shall thereafter have the right to acquire and receive upon exercise of such holder’s Warrant, in lieu of or addition to (as the case may be) the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon the exercise of such holder’s Warrant, such shares of stock, securities and/or assets as may be issued or payable in the Organic Change with respect to or in exchange for the number of shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon exercise of such holder’s Warrant had such Organic Change not taken place. The Company shall not effect any such Organic Change, unless prior to the consummation thereof, the successor entity (if other than the Company) resulting from such consolidation or merger or the entity purchasing such assets assumes by written instrument the obligation to deliver to each such Warrant holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such Warrant holder may be entitled to acquire. In any case, the Company shall make appropriate provision with respect to such Warrant holders’ rights and interests to insure that the provisions of this Section 14 shall thereafter be applicable to the Warrants. 

^^If prior to the Expiration Date, an agreement resulting in a Change of Control Event is entered into: 

^^^within 15 days prior to the date of the consummation of any Change of Control Event (the “**Change of Control Event Date**”), the Company or the surviving Person (if other than the Company) shall notify the Warrant Agent in writing of such occurrence and shall make an offer to purchase from all Warrant holders (the “**Change of Control Offer**”) all outstanding Warrants at a purchase price equal to the Change of Control Payment Amount on the Change of Control Payment Date in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 14(b) and, if the Change of Control Offer is mandatory, in accordance with Section 14(d); and 

^^^within five days after the occurrence of the Change of Control Event Date, the Company or the surviving Person (if other than the Company) shall also cause (i) a notice of the Change of Control Offer to be sent at least once to the Dow Jones News Service or similar business news service in the United States, and (ii) the Warrant Agent to send by first-class mail, postage prepaid to each Warrant holder, at the address appearing in the warrant register, a notice stating: 

^that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 14(b) and that all Warrants tendered will be accepted for payment of the Change of Control Payment Amount, and otherwise subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein; 

^the Change of Control Payment Amount and the purchase date (which shall be a business day no earlier than 20 business days and no later than 30 business days from the date such notice is mailed (the “**Change of Control Payment Date**”)); 

^that any Warrant not tendered will remain outstanding and will be adjusted in accordance with Section 14(a); 

^that Holders accepting the offer to have their Warrants purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender, in the case of Global Warrant Certificates, the Global Warrant Certificates representing such Warrants to the Warrant Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third business day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; 

^that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their acceptance if the Warrant Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the third business day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Warrant holder, the number of Warrants tendered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing his election to have such Warrants purchased; 

^those holders whose Warrants are being purchased only in part will be issued new Warrants representing the unpurchased portion of the Warrants surrendered, if any, provided that each such new Warrant issued shall be in denominations of one Warrant and integral multiples thereof; 

^any other procedures that a Warrant holder must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or effect withdrawal of such acceptance; and 

^the name and address of the Warrant Agent. 

^^^Any notice of a mandatory Change of Control Offer made pursuant to Section 14(d) shall be modified from the foregoing as appropriate, and shall state that the Expiration Date shall be deemed to be the Change of Control Payment Date for all purposes of this Agreement. 

^^^On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company or the surviving Person (if other than the Company) shall, to the extent lawful, (x) accept for payment Warrants tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer and (y) deposit with the Warrant Agent money sufficient to pay the Change of Control Payment Amount for all Warrants so tendered. The Warrant Agent, upon receipt of written instructions from the Company, shall promptly mail to each holder of Warrants so accepted, payment in an amount equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment Amount, and the Company shall execute and issue, and the Warrant Agent shall promptly authenticate a new Global Warrant Certificate or issue Book-Entry Warrants equal to any unpurchased portion of the Warrants surrendered, provided that each such new Warrants shall be issued in denominations of one Warrant and integral multiples thereof. 

^^The provisions of this Section 14(b) are subject, in all cases, to any applicable requirements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Where there is any inconsistency between the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and the requirements of this Section 14(b), the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, shall supersede. 

^^If Section 14(a) or Section 14(b) apply, the adjustments provided in Section 13 shall not apply. The provisions of this Section 14 shall apply to any successive Organic Change or Change of Control Event to the extent there are any outstanding Warrants. 

^^Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14(b) and Section 14(c), the Company may elect to make the Change of Control Offer mandatory, in which case the notice referred to in Section 14(b)(ii) shall state (i) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to Section 14(b) and this Section 14(d), and (ii) that all Warrants shall be cancelled and retired on the Change of Control Payment Date, which Change of Control Payment Date shall be no later than the Change of Control Event Date. If the Company elects to make the Change of Control Offer mandatory, the Expiration Date shall be deemed to be the Change of Control Payment Date for all purposes of this Agreement and no Warrant holder shall have any further rights under this Warrant Agreement *other than* (A) the right to receive the Change of Control Payment Amount as provided herein; or (B) as to any Warrant for which a Warrant Exercise Notice was delivered as provided in Section 9(a), the rights set forth therein. 

^Priority Adjustments, Further Actions. 

^^If any single action would require adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to more than one subsection of Section 13 or Section 14 hereof, only one adjustment shall be made and such adjustment shall be the amount of adjustment that has the highest, relative to the rights and interests of the registered holders of the Warrants then outstanding, absolute value. 

^^The Company will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any consolidation, merger, reorganization, transfer of assets, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of the Warrants, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company (i) will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock on the exercise of the Warrants from time to time outstanding and (ii) will not take any action which results in any adjustment of the Exercise Price if the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable after the action upon the exercise of all of the Warrants would exceed the total number of shares of Common Stock then authorized by the Company’s certificate of incorporation, as may be amended and in effect from time to time and available for the purposes of issue upon such exercise. Notwithstanding the previous sentences, the Company shall not be prohibited from effecting a consolidation, merger, reorganization or transfer of assets by this Section 15. 

^Fractional Interests. 

The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares of Common Stock on the exercise of Warrants. If more than one Warrant shall be presented for exercise at the same time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock that shall be issuable upon the exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock purchasable on exercise of all of the Warrants so presented. If any fraction of a share of Common Stock would, except for the provisions of this Section 16, be issuable on the exercise of any Warrants (or specified portion thereof), the Company shall notify the Warrant Agent in writing of the amount to be paid in lieu of the fraction of a share of Common Stock and concurrently pay or provide to the Warrant Agent for repayment to the Warrant holder an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) such fraction of a share of Common Stock and (ii) the excess of (x) the Market Price of a share of Common Stock over (y) the Exercise Price. The Warrant Agent shall be fully protected in relying on such notice and shall have no duty with respect to, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of, any payment for shares under this Section 16 unless and until the Warrant Agent shall have received such notice and sufficient monies. 

^Stock Exchange Listings. 

So long as any Warrants remain outstanding, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Warrants and the Warrant Shares, immediately upon their issuance upon exercise of Warrants, (i) listed on each national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed or (ii) if the Common Stock is not then listed on any national securities exchange, listed for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market System or such other over-the-counter quotation system, if any, on which the Common Stock may then be listed, in either case no later than [[Date 4: Date]]. 

^Financial and Business Information. 

Whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the Commission, commencing [[Date 5: Date]] (the “**Reporting Date**”) so long as any Warrants are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Warrant Agent and all holders of Warrants (i) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing with the Commission on Forms l0-Q and 10-K if the Company were required to file such forms, including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and, with respect to the annual information only, a report thereon by the Company’s certified independent accountants, and (ii) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the Commission on Form 8-K if the Company were required to file such reports, in each case within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and regulations (the information and reports in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, “**SEC Reports**”). The Company shall provide the Warrant Agent with a sufficient number of copies of all SEC Reports that the Warrant Agent may be required to deliver to the holders of the Warrants under this Section 18. The Company may satisfy its delivery obligation under this Section 18 by posting the SEC Reports on its website. 

^Warrant Holders Not Stockholders. 

Nothing contained in this Warrant Agreement or in any of the Global Warrant Certificates shall be construed as conferring upon the holders of any Warrant (i) the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as stockholders in respect of the meetings of stockholders or the election of Directors of the Company or any other matter or to attend any such meetings or any other proceedings of the holders of Common Stock; (ii) the right to receive any cash dividends distributable to the holders of Common Stock prior to, or for which the relevant record date precedes, the date of the exercise of such Warrant; or (iii) or any other rights whatsoever as stockholders of the Company. 

^Merger, Consolidation or Change of Name of Warrant Agent. 

Any person into which the Warrant Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Warrant Agent shall be a party, or any person succeeding to all or substantially all of the shareholder services business of the Warrant Agent or any successor Warrant Agent, shall be the successor to the Warrant Agent hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, if such person would be eligible for appointment as a successor Warrant Agent under the provisions of Section 23. If, at the time such successor to the Warrant Agent by merger or consolidation succeeds to the agency created by this Warrant Agreement, any of the Global Warrant Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor to the Warrant Agent may adopt the countersignature of the original Warrant Agent; and if, at that time any of the Global Warrant Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any such successor to the Warrant Agent may countersign such Global Warrant Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Warrant Agent or in the name of the successor Warrant Agent; and in all such cases such Global Warrant Certificates shall have the full force and effect provided in the Global Warrant Certificates and in this Warrant Agreement. 

If at any time the name of the Warrant Agent is changed and at such time any of the Global Warrant Certificates have been countersigned but not delivered, the Warrant Agent whose name has changed may adopt the countersignature under its prior name; and if at that time any of the Global Warrant Certificates have not been countersigned, the Warrant Agent whose name has changed may countersign such Global Warrant Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Global Warrant Certificates shall have the full force and effect provided in the Global Warrant Certificates and in this Warrant Agreement. 

^Warrant Agent. 

^^The Warrant Agent undertakes only the duties and obligations expressly imposed by this Warrant Agreement and the Global Warrant Certificates, in each case upon the terms and conditions set forth below, by all of which the Company and the holders of Warrants, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound: 

^^The statements contained herein and in the Global Warrant Certificates shall be taken as statements of the Company. The Warrant Agent assumes no responsibility for the accuracy or correctness of any of the same except such as describe the Warrant Agent or action taken or to be taken by it. The Warrant Agent assumes no responsibility with respect to the distribution of the Global Warrant Certificates except as herein otherwise provided. 

^^Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Warrant Agreement the Warrant Agent deems it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, the Warrant Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from an Appropriate Officer and to apply to the Appropriate Officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and such instructions shall be full authorization and protection to the Warrant Agent and, absent gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (each as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction), the Warrant Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered to be taken, or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with the instructions of any such Appropriate Officer or in reliance upon any statement signed by any one of such Appropriate Officers with respect to any fact or matter which may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by such signed statement.

In lieu of paying the Exercise Price as set forth in the preceding paragraph, subject to the provisions of the Warrant Agreement, each Book-Entry Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof, at the election of such holder, to exercise the Book-Entry Warrant by authorizing the Company to withhold from issuance a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Book-Entry Warrant which when multiplied by the Market Price of the Common Stock is equal to the aggregate Exercise Price, and such withheld shares of Common Stock shall no longer be issuable under the Book-Entry Warrant. 

The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares of Common Stock.
