Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company has the right to sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer has the obligation to purchase from the Company, Purchase Shares as follows:

^^**Commencement of Purchases of Common Stock**. After the Commencement Date (as defined below), the purchase and sale of Purchase Shares hereunder shall occur from time to time upon written notices by the Company to the Buyer on the terms and conditions as set forth herein following the satisfaction of the conditions (the “Commencement”) as set forth in Sections 6 and 7 below (the date of satisfaction of such conditions, the "Commencement Date").

The Company may deliver multiple Purchase Notices to the Buyer from time to time so long as the most recent Purchase has been completed.

^^**Payment for Purchase Shares**. The Buyer shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the Purchase Amount with respect to such Purchase Shares as full payment for such Purchase Shares via wire transfer of immediately available funds on the same Business Day that the Buyer receives such Purchase Shares if they are received by the Buyer before 1:00 p.m. eastern time or if received by the Buyer after 1:00 p.m. eastern time, the next Business Day. All payments made under this Agreement shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America via wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as the Company may from time to time designate by written notice in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Agreement is due on any day that is not a Business Day, the same shall instead be due on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day.

^^**Purchase Price Floor**. The Company and the Buyer shall not effect any sales under this Agreement on any Purchase Date where the Closing Sale Price would be less than the Floor Price. “Floor Price” means $[[USD Value 2: Number]], which shall be appropriately adjusted for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split or other similar transaction.

The representations and warranties of the Company and the Buyer contained in Sections 2, 3 and 5 hereof, the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 8 hereof and the agreements and covenants set forth in Section11, shall survive the Commencement and any termination of this Agreement.

^**[Intentionally Omitted.]**  

^^**Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver**. No failure or delay in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege.

The Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Investor to the extent it is a party thereto) constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights and remedies generally, or by general principles of equity, including principles of materiality, commercial reasonableness, good faith, conscionability and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity), and except that the enforceability of any provision of the Transaction Documents releasing, exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction may be limited by applicable federal and state laws.

^The execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the offering, sale and issuance of the Commitment Shares and the Purchase Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, do not: (i) conflict with the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company, (ii) violate or result in a breach of or a default under any material agreement, note, lease, mortgage, deed or other material instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound that is an exhibit to the SEC Documents (collectively, the “Material Agreements”), (iii) violate the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any U.S. federal or New York state statute, law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company and which in our experience is generally applicable to transactions in the nature of those contemplated by the Transaction Documents, (iv) require any consent, approval or authorization of, or any registration, declaration or filing with, any U.S. federal or New York state governmental body or regulatory agency, except (a) as contemplated by the Transaction Documents or (b) for such of the foregoing as have been obtained or made, or (v) violate any court or administrative order, writ, injunction or decree which names the Company and is specifically directed to it or its property and of which we have knowledge (which is based solely on a review of our litigation docket and a certificate of the Company dated today and delivered to you), except, in the case described in clause (ii) above, for such violations, breaches or defaults as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

^The issuance of the Purchase Shares and Commitment Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents has been duly authorized and the Commitment Shares are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, to our knowledge, free of all preemptive or other similar rights under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as currently in effect, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or any Material Agreement. When issued and paid for in accordance with the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Shares shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, to our knowledge, free of all preemptive or other similar rights under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as currently in effect, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or any Material Agreement. To our knowledge, the execution and delivery of the Registration Rights Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder shall not, give rise to any rights under any Material Agreement of any other person for the registration under the 1933 Act of any shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company which have not been waived.

^To our knowledge, except as disclosed on Schedule 3(h) in the Purchase Agreement, there is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending (in which service of process has been received by an employee or agent of the Company or an agent for service of process) before any court, public board or body, any governmental agency, any stock exchange or market, or self-regulatory organization, or which has been threatened in writing, against the Company or any of its officers or directors which (i) questions the validity of any of the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby or any action taken or to be taken pursuant thereto or (ii) is required to be disclosed in any SEC Document and has not been so disclosed. We call your attention to the fact that, in connection with the delivery of this opinion, we have not ordered or reviewed judgment, lien or any other searches of public or private records of the Company or its properties.

In addition, we have participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement (SEC File #________) covering the resale of the Purchase Shares and the Commitment Shares, including the form of prospectus contained therein, and in conferences with officers of the Company during which the Registration Statement and related matters were discussed and reviewed and, although we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in (i) the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, (ii) the form of prospectus contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (iii) the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, solely on the basis of the information that was developed in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and schedules and the other financial and statistical data, or exhibits, included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we express no belief), at the time it became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
