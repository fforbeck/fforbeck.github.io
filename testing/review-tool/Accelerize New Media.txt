^**Indemnification and Contribution.**  
^^**Indemnification by the Company** The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Placement Agent and each person, if any, who controls the Placement Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act and/or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Placement Agent or such controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (A) in the Offering Documents, or (B) in any blue sky application or other document executed by the Company specifically for blue sky purposes or based upon any other written information furnished by the Company or on its behalf to any state or other jurisdiction in order to qualify any or all of the Securities under the securities laws thereof (any such application, document or information being hereinafter called a “Blue Sky Application”), (ii) any breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or in any of the Subscription Agreements, or (iii) the omission or alleged omission by the Company to state in the Offering Documents or in any Blue Sky Application a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and will reimburse the Placement Agent and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Placement Agent or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, whether arising out of an action between the Placement Agent and a third party; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information regarding the Placement Agent which is furnished to the Company by the Placement Agent specifically for inclusion in the Offering Documents or any such Blue Sky Application or (ii) any breach by the Placement Agent of the representations, warranties or covenants contained herein (together, (i) and (ii) above are referred to as the “Non-indemnity Events”).

^^**Indemnification by the Placement Agent** The Placement Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and/or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any Non-Indemnity Event; and will reimburse the Company and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action provided that such loss, claim, damage or liability is found ultimately to arise out of or be based upon any Non-Indemnity Event.

^^**Procedure** Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify in writing the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; and the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will relieve the indemnifying party from any liability under this Section 6 as to the particular item for which indemnification is then being sought, but not from any other liability which it may have to any indemnified party. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party, similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel who shall be to the reasonable satisfaction of such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. Any such indemnifying party shall not be liable to any such indemnified party on account of any settlement of any claim or action effected without the consent of such indemnifying party.

^^**Contribution** If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to any indemnified party (other than as a result of the failure to notify the indemnifying party as provided in Section 7.3 hereof) in respect to any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand, and the Placement Agent, on the other hand, from the Offering, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above, but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand , and of the Placement Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Placement Agent, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the Offering (net of sales commissions, but before deducting other expenses) received by the Company bear to the commissions received by the Placement Agent. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Placement Agent, on the other hand, will be determined with reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact of the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, and the Placement Agent, on the other hand, and their relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

^^**Equitable Considerations** The Company and the Placement Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable consideration referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 (f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

^^**Attorneys’ Fees** The amount payable by a party under this Section 7 as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to above will be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel incurred by an indemnified party in any action or proceeding between the indemnifying party and indemnified party or between the indemnified party and any third party or otherwise).

^**Termination** Prior to the completion of the Offering Documents and the commencement of the Offering, either party may terminate this Agreement by giving a prior written notice to the other party, provided that the terminating party agrees to reimburse the other party in full for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, its legal fees and disbursements), up to a maximum of $[[USD Value 5: Number]] Following the completion of the Offering Documents and the commencement of the Offering, each of the Company and the Placement Agent will have the right to terminate this Agreement for any reason by giving a 30-day prior written notice to the other party, or, immediately upon notice at any time, at or prior to the Initial Closing: (a) if the other party shall have failed, refused, or been unable to perform any of its obligations hereunder, or breached any of its representations or warranties hereunder; or (b) if, in the Placement Agent’s or the Company’s reasonable opinion, there has occurred an event materially affecting the value of the Securities. If the Placement Agent elects not to proceed with the Offering as a result of the condition enumerated in clause (a) above, or the Company elects not to proceed with the Offering for any reason other than the Placement Agent’s failure to proceed expeditiously with the Offering, the Company shall reimburse the Placement Agent in full for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, its legal fees and disbursements), up to a maximum of $[[USD Value 5]] If the Company elects not to proceed with the Offering as a result of the condition enumerated in clause (a) above, or the Placement Agent elects not to proceed with the Offering for any reason other than the Company’s failure to proceed expeditiously with the Offering, the Placement Agent shall reimburse the Company in full for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, its legal fees and disbursements), up to a maximum of $[[USD Value 5]]

^**Competing Claims** The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Placement Agent will not proceed to perform hereunder until it receives assurances, in form and substance satisfactory to the Placement Agent and their counsel, that as of the first date that the Offering Documents are presented to potential purchasers of Shares, there will be no claims or payments for services in the nature of a finder’s fee with respect to the Offering or any other arrangements, agreements, payments, issuances or understandings that may affect the Placement Agent’s compensation hereunder other than any claims that may be made by the Placement Agent’s own personnel. The Placement Agent shall compensate any of its personnel who may have acted in such capacities, as it shall determine.

^**Miscellaneous**.  

^^**Governing Law**. This Agreement will be deemed to have been made and delivered in the State of New York and will be governed as to validity, interpretation, construction, effect and in all other respects by the internal law of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

The Company further agrees to accept and acknowledge service of any and all process which may be served in any such suit, action or proceeding in the Supreme Court of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and agrees that service of process upon it mailed by certified mail to its address shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding.
