\centered **DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES** 

Section 6.1.  Seller’s Remedies.  
^^If Purchaser fails or refuses to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement or Purchaser otherwise is in default under this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser agree that the damages Seller would sustain as a result of the failure, refusal or default by Purchaser would be substantial but would be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, Seller and Purchaser agree that in the event of such a failure, refusal or default by Purchaser, Seller will be entitled to receive the Deposit from Escrow Agent as liquidated damages as Seller’s sole and exclusive remedy, whereupon this Agreement will terminate and neither Seller nor Purchaser will have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement. 

^^If following the Closing, Purchaser materially defaults under its obligations set forth in Section 8.23 hereof, Seller shall have the right to make a Claim against Purchaser for any loss, cost, expense and damages resulting from such default, provided that any Claim by Seller against Purchaser arising out of such default shall be limited to the actual amount of the loss, cost, expense and damages suffered or incurred by Purchaser as a result of such default (excluding consequential, punitive and similar damages). 

Section 6.2.  Purchaser’s Remedies.  

^^^^^ 
^^If Seller fails to secure the appropriate corporate authorization to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.16 or materially fails to perform or materially breaches any obligations or covenants in Section 8.20(b) or Section 8.20(c) hereof, Purchaser will be entitled to receive the Deposit from Escrow Agent, this Agreement will terminate and neither Seller nor Purchaser will have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement other than those rights and obligations that expressly survive the termination of this Agreement. 

^^If Seller fails or refuses to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (other than as a result of (i) Seller’s failure to secure the appropriate authorization to consummate the transaction or (ii) Seller’s failure to effectuate the Life Time Fitness Centers Loans Separation Transaction pursuant to Section 8.20(a), for which Purchaser shall have the rights and remedies set forth in Section 3.8 hereof), including any failure by Seller to deliver to Purchaser the Closing Documents required to be delivered by Seller, Purchaser will have the right, at Purchaser’s sole option, to (i) terminate this Agreement and receive the Deposit from Escrow Agent or (ii) institute a proceeding for specific performance. 

^^If following the Closing, Seller materially defaults under its obligations set forth in Section 8.20(d), Section 8.20(e) or Section 8.22 hereof, Purchaser shall have the right to make a Claim against Seller for any loss, cost, expense and damages resulting from such default, provided that any Claim by Purchaser against Seller arising out of such default shall be limited to the actual amount of the loss, cost, expense and damages suffered or incurred by Purchaser as a result of such default (excluding consequential, punitive and similar damages). 

^^Purchaser will have no rights or remedies against Seller or Seller’s Affiliates, agents, employees, representatives or trustees in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement other than the rights and remedies expressly set forth in this Section 6.2 and the rights and remedies provided in Section 6.3 below with respect to a Material Breach of a Seller’s Representation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Purchaser’s rights under this Article will inure to the benefit of Purchaser only and will terminate with respect to each Loan, upon the transfer of all or any portion of Purchaser’s interest in such Loan or upon the acquisition by any successor to Purchaser of Purchaser’s interest in such Loan. 

Section 6.3.  Material Breach of a Seller’s Representation. 

^^If Purchaser discovers a Material Breach of a Seller’s Representation, Purchaser will deliver Notice of the Material Breach to Seller within three (3) Business Days of Purchaser’s discovery of the Material Breach, but in no event after the Material Breach Termination Date. If Purchaser fails to deliver Notice of the Material Breach to Seller within the three (3) Business Day period described above or if Purchaser delivers the Notice to Seller after the Material Breach Termination Date, Purchaser will be deemed to have waived the Material Breach and Purchaser will have no right to assert a Claim for the Material Breach. 

^^^^^ 
^^If, prior to or at the Closing, Purchaser delivers to Seller Notice of a Material Breach of a Seller’s Representation as provided in Section 6.3(a), then Seller may elect, within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Notice, in its sole and absolute discretion, to cure the Material Breach in all material respects. If Purchaser delivers the Notice to Seller less than thirty (30) days before the Closing, the Closing will be adjourned to the extent necessary to allow Seller thirty (30) days in which to make an election as described above. If Seller elects to cure the Material Breach, then the Closing will be adjourned for a reasonable period of time to allow Seller to effectuate a cure. If Seller does not make an election or, having elected to cure the Material Breach, Seller fails to do so within a reasonable period of time after Seller’s election, Purchaser will have the option either to (i) waive the Material Breach and consummate the transaction or (ii) rescind and cancel this Agreement, in which event Purchaser will be entitled to receive the Deposit from Escrow Agent and neither Seller nor Purchaser will have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement. 

^^If, after the Closing but prior to or on the Material Breach Termination Date, Purchaser delivers to Seller Notice of a Material Breach of a Seller’s Representation as to a Loan, as provided in Section 6.3(a), then Seller may elect, in its sole and absolute discretion, within thirty (30) days of Purchaser’s delivery of the Notice, either to cure the Material Breach in all material respects or to repurchase such Loan. If Seller does not make an election or, having elected to cure the Material Breach, fails to do so, any Claim arising out of the Material Breach will be limited to the lesser of (i) the actual amount of the loss suffered by Purchaser as a result of the Material Breach (excluding consequential, punitive and similar damages) as evidenced by documentation satisfactory to Seller and (ii) the amount of the Repurchase Price for such Loan. 

^^If Seller elects to repurchase a Loan, Seller will repurchase the Loan on a whole loan, servicing-released basis (except for the MGM Tower Loan and the Willowbrook Mall Loan) at the Repurchase Price. On the date of repurchase, Seller will pay the Repurchase Price to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Purchaser. 

^^In connection with any repurchase of a Loan in accordance with this Agreement, and as a condition to Seller’s payment of the Repurchase Price, Purchaser will tender to Seller the Loan Files for such Loan previously delivered to Purchaser, and Purchaser will endorse and assign to Seller each document that constitutes a part of the Loan Files that was endorsed or assigned to Purchaser, in the same manner as provided in Article III. In addition, Purchaser will make the same representations and warranties to Seller as of the date of the repurchase as Seller has made to Purchaser under Section 5.2 with respect to the sale and purchase of such Loan on the Closing Date. Furthermore, Purchaser will represent and warrant to Seller that (i) the provisions of the Note, the Mortgage, the Assignment and the other documents in such Loan Files have not been waived, modified, altered, satisfied, cancelled or subordinated in any respect or rescinded, (ii) Purchaser has not instituted any foreclosure action or other suit or proceeding in connection with such Loan, (iii) the Property has not been released from the lien of the

Upon the request of Seller, Purchaser (or its Affiliates) shall promptly provide all reasonable back-up materials requested by Seller relating to such extension. This Section 8.23(d) shall survive the Closing.
