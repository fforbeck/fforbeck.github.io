In the event that Consultant is requested or required to perform work for the Services beyond that which is specifically set forth in **Exhibit A**, any such additional services and an appropriate adjustment to the amounts owed shall be negotiated in good faith and the Parties shall amend this Agreement to reflect such additional services and any additional or modified terms in respect thereof prior to the provision of such new services.

^**Payment for Services**. Emergent shall compensate Consultant for Services in accordance with the payment terms set forth in **Exhibit A**, and all invoices for payment shall be submitted to Emergent as detailed therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any invoice to be processed and paid, such invoice must refer to the applicable Emergent Accounting Code designated in **Exhibit A**. If Consultant bills on an hourly basis, all invoices must be accompanied by a timesheet detailing the hours worked and signed by both Consultant and Emergent. Payment of Consultant’s invoices shall be in full compensation for the Services performed by Consultant unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by the Parties. Invoices shall be payable within thirty (30) days of receipt by Emergent.

Consultant shall submit monthly invoices detailing expenses incurred during the immediately preceding month by appropriate category and shall provide supporting documentation as is acceptable to Emergent in its reasonable discretion.

In the event Consultant deems it necessary to purchase equipment, goods, software or other tangible or intangible property for which it will seek reimbursement from Emergent, no such purchase shall be made and Emergent shall not be responsible for reimbursement to Consultant unless Consultant has received Emergent's express, prior written authorization.

^**Confidentiality of Information**. Consultant acknowledges that this Agreement creates a confidential relationship between Consultant and Emergent. Consultant and Emergent acknowledge that, in order to perform the Services, it will be necessary for Emergent to allow Consultant to have access to certain commercially valuable, proprietary, and confidential information of Emergent and its Affiliates.

Consultant shall return all such Confidential Information to Emergent upon completion of the Services hereunder or upon Emergent’s request. If Confidential Information is sought by any source, including any governmental organization, Consultant must immediately notify Emergent of such request and refuse to divulge any such information at least until a representative of Emergent is permitted to address the situation and either consents to the disclosure or has the opportunity to engage legal means to protect the disclosure of such information.
