^^Waiver of Immunity. The Borrower irrevocably waives any immunity to which it or its property may at any time be or become entitled, whether characterised as sovereign immunity or otherwise, from any set-off or legal action in Hong Kong or elsewhere, including immunity from service of process, immunity from jurisdiction of any court or tribunal, and immunity of any of its property from attachment prior to judgment or from execution of a judgment.
