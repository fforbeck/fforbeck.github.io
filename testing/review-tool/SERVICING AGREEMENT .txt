^The Servicer is willing to service, on behalf of the Issuer, the Receivables. 

^The Servicer is willing to act as the custodian, on behalf of the Issuer, of the Receivables and related property. 

In consideration of the foregoing, other good and valuable consideration, and the mutual terms and covenants contained herein, the Parties hereto agree as follows: 

^\centered DEFINITIONS AND USAGE 

^Definitions. Certain capitalized terms used in the above recitals and in this Agreement are defined in and shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in Appendix A to the Sale Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, between the Depositor and the Issuer. All references herein to “ the Agreement” or “ this Agreement” are to this Servicing Agreement as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the exhibits and attachments hereto and the capitalized terms used herein which are defined in such Appendix A, and all references herein to Articles, Sections and subsections are to Articles, Sections or subsections of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. The rules of construction and usage set forth in such Appendix A shall be applicable to this Agreement. 

^\centered SERVICER AS CUSTODIAN 

^Custody of Receivable Files. To assure uniform quality in servicing the Receivables and to reduce administrative costs, the Indenture Trustee, upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, hereby revocably appoints BANA to act as Custodian, and BANA hereby accepts such appointment, to act solely as the agent for the Indenture Trustee, as pledgee of the Issuer and as custodian of the following documents or instruments, which are hereby constructively delivered to the Indenture Trustee, as pledgee of the Issuer pursuant to the 

Indenture (collectively, the “Receivable Files”) with respect to each Receivable (but only to the extent applicable to such Receivable and only to the extent held in tangible paper form): 

^^the fully executed original of the installment sale contract or the promissory note and security agreement, as applicable, for such Receivable (with respect to tangible chattel paper) or an “authoritative copy” (as such term is used in Section 9-105 of the UCC) of the Receivable (with respect to electronic chattel paper) or, if no such original executed Receivable or authoritative copy exists, a copy thereof, including any written amendment or extensions thereto; *provided*, *however*, that an authoritative copy may be held by a third party service provider; 

^^the original credit application, an electronic image thereof or a photocopy thereof to the extent held in paper form; 

^^the original Certificate of Title for the related Financed Vehicle (or evidence that such certificate of title has been applied for) or such other documents (electronic or otherwise, as used in the applicable jurisdiction) that the Servicer will keep on file, in accordance with its normal policies and procedures, evidencing the security interest of BANA, as first lienholder or secured party, in such Financed Vehicle; *provided, however*, that in lieu of being held in the Receivable File, the Certificate of Title may be held by a third party service provider engaged by the servicer to obtain or to hold the Certificate of Title; and 

^^any and all other documents that the Servicer keeps on file in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices relating to the individual Receivable, Obligor or Financed Vehicle. 

The Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall have no responsibility to monitor the Servicer’s performance as custodian and shall have no liability in connection with the Servicer’s performance of such duties hereunder. 

The Custodian hereby acknowledges receipt of the Receivable Files for each Receivable listed on the Schedule of Receivables. 

^Effective Period, Termination, and Amendment; Interpretive and Additional Provisions. The Servicer’s appointment as Custodian has become effective as of the Cut-Off Date and will continue in full force and effect until terminated as herein provided. The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties imposed on it by this Agreement as Custodian except upon the reasonable determination by the Servicer that the performance of its duties herein is no longer permissible under applicable law. No such resignation shall become effective until a successor Custodian shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the Custodian in accordance with Section 6.2. If BANA resigns as Servicer in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or if all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer are terminated under Section 6.1, the appointment of the Servicer as Custodian hereunder will be terminated. As soon as practicable after any termination under this Section 2.2 the Custodian at its expense will deliver to the Indenture Trustee or the Indenture Trustee’s designee, the Receivable Files and the related accounts and Records maintained by the Custodian at such place or places as the Indenture Trustee may reasonably designate *provided*, *however*, that with respect to authoritative copies of the Receivables constituting electronic chattel paper, the Servicer, as Custodian, in its sole discretion, shall either (i) continue to hold any such authoritative copies on behalf of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee or the Indenture Trustee’s agent or (ii) deliver copies of such authoritative copies and destroy the authoritative copies maintained by the Servicer prior to its termination such that such copy delivered to the Indenture Trustee or the Indenture Trustee’s agent becomes the authoritative copy of the Receivable constituting electronic chattel paper. 

^\centered ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF 

\centered RECEIVABLES AND PURCHASED PROPERTY 

^Duties of Servicer. Effective as of the Cut-Off Date, the Servicer is hereby appointed and authorized to act as agent for the Issuer and in such capacity shall manage, service, administer, make collections on, and make remittances with respect to, the Receivables in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices, using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with respect to comparable automotive receivables that it services for itself or others. The Servicer hereby accepts such appointment and authorization and agrees to perform the duties of Servicer set forth herein. The Servicer’s duties shall include tracking the balances of outstanding Receivables, notifying Obligors of the amounts and due dates of their required payments, communicating with Obligors regarding their accounts and seeking to collect overdue payments. The Servicer is not required under the Transaction Documents to make any disbursements via wire transfer or otherwise on behalf of an Obligor. There are no requirements under the Receivables or the Transaction Documents for funds to be, and funds shall not be, held in trust for an Obligor. No payments or disbursements shall be made by the Servicer on behalf of an Obligor. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.2, the Servicer shall follow its Customary Servicing Practices and shall have full power and authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with such managing, servicing, administration and collection that it may deem necessary or desirable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered, pursuant to this Section 3.1, to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself or the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders, the Certificateholder, or any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Receivables and the Financed Vehicles. The Servicer is hereby authorized to commence, in its own name or in the name of the Issuer, a legal Proceeding to enforce a Receivable as contemplated by Section 3.3, to enforce all obligations or participate in a legal Proceeding (including without limitation a bankruptcy Proceeding) relating to or involving a Receivable including a Defaulted Receivable. If the Servicer commences or participates in such a legal Proceeding in its own name, the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered by the Issuer pursuant to this Section 3.1 to obtain possession of the related Financed Vehicle and immediately and without further action on the part of the Issuer or the Servicer, the Issuer shall thereupon automatically assign in trust such Receivable and the security interest in the related Financed Vehicle to the Servicer for the benefit of the Issuer for purposes of commencing or participating in any such Proceeding as a party or claimant. Upon such automatic assignment, the Servicer will be, and will have all the rights and duties of, a secured party under the UCC and other applicable law with respect to such Receivable and the related Financed Vehicle. At the 

Servicer’s request from time to time, the Issuer shall provide the Servicer with evidence of the assignment in trust for the benefit of the Issuer, as applicable, as may be reasonably necessary for the Servicer to take any of the actions set forth in the following sentence. The Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered by the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver in the Servicer’s name any notices, demands, claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents or instruments in connection with any such Proceeding. If in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding it shall be held that the Servicer may not enforce a Receivable on the grounds that it shall not be a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce such Receivable, the Issuer shall, at the Servicer’s expense and direction, take steps to enforce such Receivable, including bringing suit in the name of the Issuer. The Issuer shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney and other documents and take any other steps which the Servicer may deem necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its duties herein. Except to the extent required by the preceding two sentences, the authority and rights granted to the Servicer in this Section 3.1 shall be nonexclusive and shall not be construed to be in derogation of the retention by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee of equivalent authority and rights. 

^Collection of Receivable Payments. (a) The Servicer will make reasonable efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and provisions of the Receivables as and when the same become due in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices. Subject to Section 3.6, the Servicer may grant waivers, extensions, deferrals, alterations, amendments, modifications or adjustments with respect to any Receivable in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices; *provided*, *however*, that if the Servicer (i) extends the date for final payment by the Obligor of any Receivable beyond the last day of the Collection Period preceding the Final Scheduled Payment Date for the latest maturing Class of Notes (such extension, a “ Post-Maturity Term Extension”), or (ii) reduces the Annual Percentage Rate or the Amount Financed with respect to any Receivable (such reduction, a “ Reduction Event”) other than as required by applicable law (including, without limitation, by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act) or by court order it will promptly purchase such Receivable in the manner provided in Section 3.7; *provided*, *further*, that the Servicer shall not make any modification described in the preceding proviso that would trigger a purchase pursuant to the above provisions or pursuant to Section 3.7, in either case for the sole purpose of enabling the Servicer to purchase a Receivable from the Issuer. The Servicer shall not be required to make any advances of funds or guarantees regarding collections, cash flows or distributions. Payments on the Receivables, including payoffs, made in accordance with the related documentation for such Receivables, shall be posted to the Servicer’s records related to such Receivables in accordance with the its Customary Servicing Practices. Such payments shall be allocated to principal, interest or other items in accordance with the related documentation for such Receivables. 

^^The Servicer may in its discretion waive any late payment charge or any other fees that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing a Receivable. The Servicer and its Affiliates may engage in any marketing practice or promotion or any sale of any products, goods or services to Obligors with respect to the Receivables for the account of the Servicer and/or its Affiliates (but not the Issuer) so long as such practices, promotions or sales are offered to obligors of comparable motor vehicle receivables serviced by the Servicer for itself and others, whether or not such practices, promotions or sales might indirectly result in a decrease in the aggregate amount of payments made (but not any related contractual obligation) on the 

Receivables, prepayments or faster or slower timing of the payment of the Receivables. The Servicer and its Affiliates may also sell insurance or debt cancellation products, including products which result in the repayment of some or all of the amount of a Receivable owned by the Issuer upon the death or disability of the Obligor or any casualty with respect to the Financed Vehicle. 

^^The Servicer shall distribute to the applicable Obligor any rebates or refunds of premiums with respect to the cancellation or termination of any insurance policy, extended warranty or service contract required by law or contract to be returned to such Obligor (but only to the extent such amounts are actually received by the Servicer). 

^^Records documenting collection efforts with respect to any Receivable shall be maintained by the Servicer during the period a Receivable is delinquent in accordance with the Servicer’s Customary Servicing Practices. Such records shall be maintained on at least a periodic basis that is not less frequent than the Servicer’s Customary Servicing Practices, and describe the entity’s activities in monitoring delinquent pool assets including, for example, phone calls, letters and payment rescheduling plans in cases where delinquency is deemed temporary (e.g., illness or unemployment) in accordance with the Servicer’s Customary Servicing Practices. 

^^The Servicer shall not be required to maintain a fidelity bond or errors and omissions policy. 

^Realization Upon Receivables. On behalf of the Issuer, the Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its Customary Servicing Practices, to repossess or otherwise convert the ownership of the Financed Vehicle securing any Receivable as to which the Servicer has determined eventual payment in full is unlikely unless it determines in its sole discretion that repossession will not increase the Liquidation Proceeds by an amount greater than the expense of such repossession or that the proceeds ultimately recoverable with respect to such Receivable would be increased by forbearance. The Servicer is authorized to follow such Customary Servicing Practices as it follows in its servicing of comparable motor vehicle receivables, which practices, policies and procedures may include selling the Financed Vehicles at public or private sale and other actions by the Servicer in order to realize upon such a Receivable. The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in any case in which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the Servicer shall not be required to expend funds in connection with any repair or towards the repossession of such Financed Vehicle unless it shall reasonably determine in its discretion that such repair and/or repossession shall increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related Receivable by an amount greater than the amount of such expenses. After repossession of a Financed Vehicle, the Servicer shall in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices sell such Financed Vehicle in a public or private sale as soon as is practicable after repossession, subject to any applicable laws. The Servicer is authorized to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate on behalf of the Issuer to evidence the sale of the Financed Vehicle at public or private sale free from any Lien or other interest of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee. The Servicer shall be entitled to receive Liquidation Expenses with respect to each Defaulted Receivable at such time as the Receivable becomes a Defaulted Receivable from the related Liquidation Proceeds. 

The Servicer, in its sole discretion, may in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices sell any Receivable’s Deficiency Balance. Net proceeds of any such sale allocable to the related Receivable will constitute Liquidation Proceeds, and the sole right of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee with respect to any such Receivable will be to receive such Liquidation Proceeds. Upon such sale, (i) the Indenture Trustee shall release the lien on any Deficiency Balance sold by the Servicer hereunder and (ii) the Servicer will mark its computer records indicating that any such Receivable has been sold. 

^Allocations of Collections. If an Obligor is obligated under one or more Receivables and also under one or more other assets owned by the Servicer or assigned to a third party, then any payment on any such asset received from or on behalf of such Obligor will, if identified as being made with respect to a particular item or asset, be applied to such item, and otherwise will be allocated by the Servicer in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices. 

^Maintenance of Security Interests in Financed Vehicles. The Servicer shall, in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices and at its own expense, take such steps as are necessary to maintain perfection of the security interest created by each Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle. It is understood that the Financed Vehicles are the collateral and security for the Receivables, but that the Certificate of Title with respect to a Financed Vehicle does not constitute collateral and merely evidences such security interest. The Issuer hereby authorizes the Servicer to re-perfect such security interest on behalf of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, as necessary because of the relocation of a Financed Vehicle, or for any other reason. 

^Covenants of Servicer. Unless required by law (including, without limitation, by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act) or court order, the Servicer will not release the Financed Vehicle securing each such Receivable from the security interest granted by such Receivable in whole or in part except (i) in the event of payment in full by or on behalf of the Obligor thereunder or payment in full less a deficiency which the Servicer would or would not attempt to collect in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices, (ii) in connection with repossession or (iii) except as may be required by an insurer in order to receive proceeds from any Insurance Policy covering such Financed Vehicle. 

^Purchase of Receivables Upon Breach by the Servicer. Upon discovery by any party to this Agreement of (i) a Post-Maturity Term Extension or a Reduction Event as contemplated by Section 3.2 or (ii) a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Sections 3.5 or 3.6 that materially and adversely affects the interest of the Noteholders, the party discovering such event described in clause (i) or (ii) herein shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other party hereto; *provided,* that delivery of the Monthly Servicer Report, which identifies Receivables that are being or have been purchased, shall be deemed to constitute prompt notice of such event; *provided*, *further*, the failure to give such notice shall not affect any obligation of the Servicer hereunder. If (i) either a Post-Maturity Term Extension or Reduction Event occurs with respect to any Receivable or (ii) a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Sections 3.5 or 3.6 materially and adversely affects the interests of the Noteholders, then the Servicer shall either (i) correct or cure such breach or (ii) purchase such Receivable from the holder thereof, in either case on or before the last day of the second Collection Period (or, at the option of the Servicer, the last day of the first Collection Period) following the date the Servicer became aware of or was notified of such breach. Any such breach or failure of the covenants set forth in Sections 3.5 or 3.6 will be deemed to not have a material and adverse effect if such breach or failure does not affect the ability of the Issuer (or its assignee) to collect, receive and retain timely payment in full on such Receivable, including Liquidation Proceeds. Any such purchase by the Servicer shall be at a price equal to the related Repurchase Price. In consideration for such purchase, the Servicer shall make a payment to the Issuer equal to the Repurchase Price by depositing such amount into the Collection Account on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date immediately following the date of such repurchase. Upon receipt by the Issuer of such Repurchase Price by the Servicer, the Issuer shall (and shall cause the Indenture Trustee to) release and execute and deliver such instruments of release, transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse or representation, as may be reasonably requested by the Servicer to evidence such release, transfer or assignment or more effectively vest in the Servicer or its designee all of the Issuer’s rights (and, if applicable, the Indenture Trustee’s rights and security interest) in any Receivable and related Purchased Assets repurchased pursuant to this Section 3.7. It is understood and agreed that the right to cause the Servicer to purchase any Receivable as described above shall constitute the sole remedy (except as provided in Section 5.2 of this Agreement) against the Servicer for such breach available to the Issuer. 

^Servicing Fee and Supplemental Servicing Fee Payable to the Servicer. (a) Servicing Fee. To compensate the Servicer for services rendered under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the Issuer will pay the Servicer the Servicing Fee from the Cut-Off Date until the earliest to occur of:

^^^termination of the Servicer pursuant to Section 6.2; or 

^^^the Termination Date (as defined in Section 6.5).

^^Supplemental Servicing Fee. In addition to the Servicing Fee, and as additional compensation for its services rendered under this Agreement, the Servicer will be entitled to retain any late fees, prepayment charges, extension fees and other administrative fees and expenses or similar charges allowed by applicable law collected (from whatever source) on the Receivables during each Collection Period (such amounts, the “Supplemental Servicing Fee”).

^^The Servicer will deliver to the Issuer, with a copy to the Indenture Trustee and the Administrator promptly after having obtained knowledge thereof, notice of the occurrence of any Servicer Termination Event. Except to the extent set forth in this Sections 3.9(b), 6.3 and 

^^of this Agreement and Sections 3.12 and 6.5 of the Indenture, the Transaction Documents do not require any policies or procedures to monitor any performance or other triggers and Events of Default. 

^^So long as the Depositor is filing any reports with respect to the Issuer under the Exchange Act, the Servicer will deliver to the Issuer, on or before [[Date 1]] of each year, beginning on [[Date 1]], 20[__], a report regarding the Servicer’s assessment of compliance with the Servicing Criteria during the immediately preceding calendar year, including disclosure of any material instance of non-compliance identified by the Servicer, as required under paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-18, Rule 15d-18 of the Exchange Act and Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

^Servicer Expenses. Subject to any limitations on the Servicer’s liability herein, the Servicer will be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities hereunder, including fees, expenses and disbursements of any independent accountants and taxes imposed on the Servicer, except expenses incurred in realizing upon Receivables under Section 3.3. 

^Annual Registered Public Accounting Firm Attestation Report. So long as the Depositor is filing any reports with respect to the Issuer under the Exchange Act, on or before [[Date 2: Date]] of each year, beginning [[Date 3: Date]], 20[__], the Servicer shall cause a registered public accounting firm, who may also render other services to the Servicer or to its Affiliates, to furnish to the Servicer and the Depositor, each attestation report on assessments of compliance with the Servicing Criteria with respect to the Servicer or any Affiliate thereof during the related fiscal year delivered by such accountants pursuant to paragraph (c) of Rule 13a-18 or Rule 15d-18 of the Exchange Act and Item 1122 of Regulation AB. The certification required by this paragraph may be replaced by any similar certification using other procedures or attestation standards which are now or in the future in use by servicers of comparable assets, or which otherwise comply with any rule, regulation, “no action” letter or similar guidance promulgated by the Commission. 

^1934 Act Filings. The Issuer hereby authorizes the Servicer and the Depositor, or either of them, to prepare, sign, certify and file any and all reports, statements and information respecting the Issuer and/or the Notes required to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder.

Pending deposit in the Collection Account, Collections may be used by the Servicer at its own risk and are not required to be segregated from its own funds. 

^^If the Monthly Remittance Condition is not satisfied with respect to the Servicer, then the Servicer shall deposit an amount equal to all Collections on the Receivables received by the Servicer into the Collection Account within two Business Days of identification by the Servicer.

No disbursements shall be made directly by the Servicer to a Noteholder, and the Servicer shall not be required to maintain any investor record relating to the posting of disbursements or otherwise. 

^\centered THE SERVICER 

^Representations of Servicer. The Servicer makes the following representations as of the Cut-Off Date and as of the Closing Date: 

^^Existence and Power. The Servicer is a national banking association validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States and has, in all material respects, full power and authority to own its assets and operate its business as presently owned or operated, and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or affect the enforceability or collectibility of the Receivables or any other part of the Purchased Assets.

^^^failure on the part of the Servicer duly to observe or to perform in any material respect any other covenants or agreements, as the case may be, set forth in this Agreement, which failure shall (A) materially and adversely affect the rights of Noteholders or Certificateholders and (B) continue unremedied for a period of ninety (90) days after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given (1) to the Servicer by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee or (2) to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Servicer by the Noteholders of Notes evidencing not less than a majority of the Note Balance amount of the Outstanding Notes or, if no Notes are Outstanding, by holders of Certificates evidencing a majority of the beneficial interest in the Issuer; or 

^^^the Servicer suffers a Bankruptcy Event; 

*provided, however,* that if a delay in or failure of performance referred to under clauses (i) or (ii) above was caused by *force majeure* or similar occurrence the grace period in the applicable clause will be extended for an additional thirty days; 

*provided, further,* the existence or occurrence of any “material instance of noncompliance” (within the meaning of Item 1122 of Regulation AB) shall not create any presumption that any event in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above has occurred; 

then the Indenture Trustee (*provided*, that a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee shall have received written notice thereof) shall promptly notify each Rating Agency, and in each and every case, so long as a Servicer Termination Event shall not have been remedied, either the Indenture Trustee or the holders of Notes evidencing not less than a majority of the principal amount of the Notes Outstanding (or, if no Notes are Outstanding, Holders of Certificates evidencing at least a majority of the beneficial interest in the Issuer), by notice then given in writing to the Servicer (and to the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer if given by the Noteholders and to the Issuer if given by the Certificateholders and in each case with a copy to the Rating Agencies) may terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement. On or after the receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Notes, the Certificates or the Trust Estate or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the Indenture Trustee or such successor Servicer as may be appointed under Section 6.2; and, without limitation, the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer are hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the predecessor Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement of the Receivables and related documents, or otherwise. 

^^Upon termination of the Servicer under Section 6.1(a), the predecessor Servicer shall cooperate with the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer and such successor Servicer in effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the predecessor Servicer under this Agreement, including the transfer to the Indenture Trustee or such successor Servicer for administration of all cash amounts that shall at the time be held by the predecessor Servicer for deposit, or shall thereafter be received with respect to a Receivable and the delivery of the Receivable Files and the related accounts and Records to the extent maintained by the Servicer. All reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with transferring the Receivable Files to the successor Servicer and amending this Agreement to reflect such succession as Servicer pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall be paid by the predecessor Servicer upon presentation of reasonable documentation of such costs and expenses. 

^Appointment of Successor Servicer. (a) Upon the Servicer’s receipt of notice of termination pursuant to Section 6.1 or the Servicer’s resignation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the predecessor Servicer shall continue to perform its functions as Servicer under this Agreement, in the case of termination, only until the date specified in such termination notice or, if no such date is specified in a notice of termination, until receipt of such notice and, in the case of resignation, until the later of (x) the date 45 days from the delivery to the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer of written notice of such resignation (or written confirmation of such notice) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (y) the date upon which the predecessor Servicer shall become unable to act as Servicer, as specified in the notice of resignation and accompanying Opinion of Counsel. In the event of the Servicer’s resignation or termination hereunder, the Indenture Trustee shall appoint a successor Servicer, and the successor Servicer shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in form acceptable to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee (with a copy to each Rating Agency). In the event that a successor Servicer has not been appointed at the time when the predecessor Servicer has ceased to act as Servicer in accordance with this Section 6.2, the Indenture Trustee without further action shall automatically be appointed the successor Servicer. The Indenture Trustee may resign as the Servicer by giving written notice of such resignation to the Issuer and in such event shall be released from such duties and obligations, such release not to be effective until the date a successor Servicer enters into a written assumption as provided in this Section 6.2. Upon delivery of any such notice to the Issuer, the Issuer shall obtain a new servicer as the successor Servicer in accordance with this Section 6.2. Notwithstanding the above, if the Indenture Trustee shall be legally unable so to act or if, within 30 days after the delivery of its notice of resignation, the Issuer shall not have obtained a successor Servicer, the Indenture Trustee shall appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, any established institution, having a net worth of not less than $[[USD Value 1: Number]] and whose regular business shall include the servicing of automotive receivables, as the successor to the Servicer under this Agreement; *provided* that the Rating Agency Condition shall be satisfied in connection with such appointment. 

^^Upon appointment, the successor Servicer shall be the successor in all respects to the predecessor Servicer and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties, and liabilities arising thereafter relating thereto placed on the predecessor Servicer, by the terms and provisions of this Agreement; *provided*, that (i) any failure of such successor Servicer to perform such responsibilities or duties that are caused by the predecessor Servicer’s failure to provide information or monies required hereunder shall not be considered a default by such successor Servicer, (ii) such successor Servicer shall have no liability for actions, inactions or representations of the predecessor Servicer, (iii) the successor Servicer shall have no obligation to pay any taxes required to be paid by the predecessor Servicer, (iv) the successor Servicer shall have no obligation to pay any of the fees and expenses of any other party involved in this transaction and (v) the successor Servicer shall have no liability or obligation with respect to any indemnification obligations of any predecessor Servicer. The indemnification obligations of the successor Servicer are expressly limited to those instances in which liability would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith. 

^^In connection with such appointment, the Indenture Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor Servicer out of payments on Receivables as it and such successor Servicer shall agree; *provided*, *however*, that no such compensation shall be in excess of the compensation permitted for the predecessor Servicer under this Agreement. The Indenture Trustee and such successor Servicer shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession. 

^^Notwithstanding anything herein or in the other Transaction Documents to the contrary, in no event shall any successor Servicer be required to purchase any Receivable pursuant to Section 3.7 herein. 

^Notification to Noteholders and Certificateholders. Upon any termination of, or appointment of a successor to, the Servicer pursuant to this Article VI, the Indenture Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to Noteholders, and the Issuer shall give prompt written notice thereof to Certificateholders at their respective addresses of record and to each Rating Agency. 

^Waiver of Past Servicer Termination Events.

Upon any such waiver of a past Servicer Termination Event, such Servicer Termination Event shall cease to exist, and shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Servicer Termination Event or impair any right consequent thereon. The Indenture Trustee shall provide written notice of any such waiver to the Rating Agencies. 

^Termination. Unless earlier terminated, this Agreement will terminate on the Payment Date in the month following the final payment or liquidation of all the Receivables (the “ Termination Date”). 

^Optional Purchase of All Receivables. The Servicer, may purchase the outstanding Receivables (such purchase, the “ Optional Purchase”) and the other assets in the Trust Estate (other than the Reserve Account) on any Payment Date if both of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) as of the last day of the related Collection Period, the Pool Balance has declined to [[Percentage 2: Number]]% or less of the Pool Balance as of the Cut-Off Date and (ii) the sum of the Optional Purchase Price and the Available Collections for such Payment Date would be sufficient to pay (A) the Servicing Fee for such Payment Date and all unpaid Servicing Fees with respect to prior periods, (B) interest then due on the Notes, (C) the aggregate Outstanding Note Balance of all of the Notes, as determined by the Indenture Trustee and (D) expenses (including indemnification amounts) due to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Administrator and the Servicer, which have not been previously paid. To exercise such option, the Servicer shall deposit the Optional Purchase Price into the Collection Account on the Business Day prior to such Payment Date. The Servicer shall furnish written notice of such election to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee not later than twenty (20) days (or such longer period as may be required by the Clearing Agency in connection with the Note Depository Agreement for notice in connection with a redemption of the Notes) prior to the Redemption Date. Following its receipt of such notice, (i) the Indenture Trustee will promptly (but not later than 3 Business Days after it has received such notice) provide notice of such purchase [to the Swap Counterparty and] to the Noteholders of record on such date and (ii) the Issuer will promptly (but not later than 3 Business Days after it has received such notice) provide notice of such purchase to the Certificateholders of record on such date. The purchase price for the Trust Estate (other than the Reserve Account) under this Section 6.6 shall be equal to the Optional Purchase Price. If the Servicer exercises its option to purchase the Trust Estate (other than the Reserve Account), the Notes shall be redeemed and in each case in whole but not in part on the Redemption Date for the Redemption Price.
