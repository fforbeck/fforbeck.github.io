^**Authorization of Stockholders’ Representative**. Each Principal Stockholder hereby confirms his approval of the Stockholders’ Representative’s power and authority, and each of the other provisions set forth in Article XI of the Merger Agreement is hereby agreed, confirmed and ratified and shall be deemed incorporated by reference herein. In addition to the powers and authority granted thereby, the Stockholders’ Representative is hereby appointed, authorized and empowered to act for the benefit of each Principal Stockholder in connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, as the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each Principal Stockholder, for the following purposes and with the following powers and authority:

^^^in the event of an amendment to the Merger Agreement which is approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, to confirm to the Purchaser that this Agreement, the Option Agreement and, to the extent any Stockholder consent is required therefor, that the consents of the Principal Stockholders in the Company Stockholders’ Consents remain in full force and effect; and

^^^to execute and deliver such immaterial modifications or waivers in connection with this Agreement or, to the extent any Stockholder consent is required, the Merger Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

^**Miscellaneous**.  

^^Continuing Obligations; Equitable Remedies. The restrictions set forth in Sections 1 and 2 are considered by the parties to be reasonable for the purposes of protecting the value of the business and goodwill of the Surviving Corporation (after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger) and each Principal Stockholder acknowledges that the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation would be irreparably harmed and that monetary damages would not provide an adequate remedy to the Purchaser in the event the covenants contained in Sections 1 and 2 were not complied with in accordance with their terms. The Principal Stockholders agree that any breach by such Principal Stockholder of any provision of Sections 1 or 2 shall entitle the Purchaser and, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to secure the enforcement of these provisions, in addition to any other remedies (including damages) which may be available to the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation. If any of the Principal Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates, heirs and personal and legal representatives breaches the covenants set forth in Section 1, the one-year period from the Closing Date described therein during which such restrictions apply shall be extended for a period equal to the period that a court having jurisdiction has determined that such covenant has been breached. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of Sections 1 and 2 be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If any provisions of Section 1 or 2 relating to the time period, scope of activities or geographic area of restrictions is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum permissible time period, scope of activities or geographic area, as the case may be, the time period, scope of activities or geographic area shall be reduced to the maximum which such court deems enforceable. If any provisions of Section 1 or 2 other than those described in the preceding sentence are adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed amended (with respect only to the jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made) in such manner as to render them enforceable and to effectuate as nearly as possible the original intentions and agreement of the parties.

^^Public Announcement. No public announcement or other publicity regarding this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be made prior to or after the date hereof without the prior written consent of Company and Purchaser as to form, content, timing and manner of distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude any party or its Affiliates from making any public announcement or filing required pursuant to any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation.

^^Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when delivered personally, (b) when transmitted by facsimile (receipt confirmed), (c) on the fifth (5th) Business Day following mailing by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), or (d) on the next Business Day following deposit with an overnight delivery service of national reputation, to the parties at the following addresses and facsimile numbers (or at such other address or facsimile number for a party as may be specified by like notice):
