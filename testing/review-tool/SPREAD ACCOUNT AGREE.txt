^^Resignation. The Collateral Agent and any successor Collateral Agent may resign only (i) upon a determination that by reason of a change in legal requirements the performance of its duties under this Agreement would cause it to be in violation of such legal requirements in a manner which would result in a material adverse effect on the Collateral Agent, and the Controlling Party does not elect to waive the Collateral Agent’s obligation to perform those duties which render it legally unable to act or elect to delegate those duties to another Person, or (ii) with the prior written consent of the Controlling Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

Such predecessor shall, nevertheless, on the written request of either Secured Party or the Trust, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all the estates, properties, rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder.

No amendment, modification, waiver or supplement to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement shall in any event be effective unless the same shall have been made or consented to in writing by each of the parties hereto and each Rating Agency shall have received prior written notice with respect to such amendment, modification, waiver or supplement; notwithstanding the foregoing, for so long as Assured Guaranty shall be the Controlling Party, amendments, modifications, waivers or supplements hereto, the Collateral or the Spread Account or any requirement hereunder to deposit or retain any amounts in such Spread Account or to distribute any amounts therein as provided in Section 3.03 shall be effective if made or consented to in writing by Assured Guaranty, the Trust and the Collateral Agent (the consent of which shall not be withheld or delayed with respect to any amendment that does not adversely affect the Collateral Agent), but shall in no circumstances require the consent of the Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent or the Noteholders. 

^Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any party hereto or to any circumstance or in any jurisdiction governing this Agreement shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute, regulation or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it is invalid or unenforceable and the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of any such invalid or unenforceable provision to the parties, jurisdictions or circumstances other than to whom or to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby nor shall the same affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree that the holding by any court of competent jurisdiction that any remedy pursued by the Collateral Agent, or any of the Secured Parties, hereunder is unavailable or unenforceable shall not affect in any way the ability of the Collateral Agent or any of the Secured Parties to pursue any other remedy available to it or them (subject, however, to the provisions of this Agreement limiting such remedies).
