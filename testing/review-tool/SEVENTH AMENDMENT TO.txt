At the request of the Borrower or the Lender, any Claim shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9, U.S. Code) (the “Act”). The Act will apply even though the Loan Agreement provides that it is governed by the law of a specified state.

Arbitration proceedings will be determined in accordance with the Act, the applicable rules and procedures for the arbitration of disputes of JAMS or any successor thereof (“JAMS”), and the terms of this paragraph. In the event of any inconsistency, the terms of this paragraph shall control.

The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS and conducted in any U.S. state where real or tangible personal property collateral for this credit is located or if there is no such collateral, in Maryland. All Claims shall be determined by one arbitrator; however, if Claims exceed Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 6]]), upon the request of any party, the Claims shall be decided by three arbitrators. All arbitration hearings shall commence within ninety (90) days of the demand for arbitration and close within ninety (90) days of commencement and the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be issued within thirty (30) days of the close of the hearing. However, the arbitrator(s), upon a showing of good cause, may extend the commencement of the hearing for up to an additional sixty (60) days. The arbitrator(s) shall provide a concise written statement of reasons for the award. The arbitration award may be submitted to any court having jurisdiction to be confirmed and enforced.

The arbitrator(s) will have the authority to decide whether any Claim is barred by the statute of limitations and, if so, to dismiss the arbitration on that basis. For purposes of the application of the statute of limitations, the service on JAMS under applicable JAMS rules of a notice of Claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit. Any dispute concerning this arbitration provision or whether a claim is arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to award legal fees pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.

This paragraph does not limit the right of the Lender to: (i) exercise self-help remedies, such as but not limited to, setoff; (ii) initiate judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure against any real or personal property collateral; (iii) exercise any judicial or power of sale rights; or (iv) act in a court of law to obtain an interim remedy, such as but not limited to, injunctive relief, writ of possession or appointment of a receiver, or additional or supplementary remedies.

^ \centered 17. **WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL**.

FURTHERMORE, WITHOUT INTENDING IN ANY WAY TO LIMIT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, TO THE EXTENT ANY CLAIM IS NOT ARBITRATED, THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF SUCH CLAIM. THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE PARTIES ENTERING INTO THIS SEVENTH AMENDMENT AND THE LOAN AGREEMENT. 

^ \centered 18. **No Oral Agreements**. This Seventh Amendment, the Loan Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the other Amendment Documents constitute the entire agreement of the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten or oral agreements between the parties.    

^ \centered 19. **Illegality or Unenforceability**.  Any determination that any provision or application of this Seventh Amendment is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, or in any instance, shall not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of any such provision in any other instance, or the validity, legality, or enforceability of any other provision of this Seventh Amendment. 

^ \centered 20. **Counterparts**. This Seventh Amendment may be executed in multiple identical counterparts, each of which when duly executed shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall be construed together as one agreement. This Seventh Amendment will not be binding on or constitute evidence of a contract between the parties hereto until such time as a counterpart has been executed by such party and a copy thereof is delivered to each other party to this Seventh Amendment.
