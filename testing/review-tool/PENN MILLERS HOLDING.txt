^\centered INTRODUCTION 

Section  1.1  Purpose. The purpose of the Penn Millers Holding Corporation Open Market Share Purchase Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) is to attract, retain and motivate certain key employees of the Penn Millers Holding Corporation (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries, to focus the efforts of employees on continued improvement in the profitability of the Company, and to promote the success and enhance the value of the Company by requiring employees to increase their stock ownership in the Company. The Plan is a cash-based long-term incentive plan that provides award opportunities based on achievement of performance goals over a two-year or three-year period. 

Section  1.2  Effective Date. The “Effective Date” of the Plan is [[[Date 1: Date]]]. 

Section  1.3  Administration. The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”). The Committee, from time to time, may adopt any rules and procedures it deems necessary or desirable for the proper and efficient administration of the Plan that are consistent with the terms of the Plan. Any notice or document required to be given or filed with the Committee will be properly given or filed if delivered to or mailed by registered mail, postage paid, to the Corporate Secretary of the Board of Directors, Penn Millers Holding Corporation, [[Address 1: Address]]-0016. For purposes of this Plan, the term “Compensation Committee” shall mean the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), which Committee shall be composed of two or more members of the Board, all of whom are (a) “non-employee directors” as such term is defined under the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (b) “outside directors” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and (c) independent under any applicable stock listing agreement with, or rules of, any exchange or electronic trading system. 

Section  1.4  Supplements. The provisions of the Plan may be modified by supplements to the Plan. The terms and provisions of each supplement are a part of the Plan and supersede any other provisions of the Plan to the extent necessary to eliminate any inconsistencies between the supplement and any other Plan provisions.

^\centered ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION 

Section  2.1  Eligibility. Any employee of the Company is eligible to become a “Participant” in the Plan, provided the employee is designated as a Participant by the Committee in writing. 

Section  2.2  Participation. A designated employee or otherwise eligible employee will become a Participant as of the later of the Effective Date or the date specified by the Committee. Any Participant may be removed as an active Participant by the Committee effective as of any date. 

^\centered AWARDS 

Section  3.1  Awards. At the beginning of each Performance Period, the Committee may, in its discretion, make an Award to a Participant. Each Award will be equal to a percentage of the Participant’s annual base salary at the beginning of the Performance Period as described in the applicable Award Agreement. 

^^Performance Period. Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, a “Performance Period” is a rolling three-calendar-year period over which an Award can be earned. 

^^Award Agreement. An “Award” to a Participant will be evidenced by a written “Award Agreement” issued by the Company to a Participant that specifies the Performance Goals, the Performance Period, and other necessary terms and conditions applicable to the Award. Such Award Agreement will be substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto. 

^^Award Levels. Participants will receive varying Awards based on their position with the Company. 

^^Discretionary Award. The President and Chief Executive Officer may recommend to the Committee, and the Committee, with respect to the President and Chief Executive Officer, may recommend to the Board, that an additional discretionary Award (the “Discretionary Award”) be made to a Participant to address external market considerations, including for recruiting purposes. 

^^Final Award. The “Final Award” is the amount of an Award as adjusted based upon the level at which the Performance Goals have been achieved, including any Discretionary Award, that is ultimately paid to a Participant under the Plan for a Performance Period. Final Awards may be modified up or down at the Committee’s discretion to account for performance that is not captured in the Performance Goals. The Committee in its discretion may also consider Extraordinary Occurrences when assessing performance results and determining Final Awards. “Extraordinary Occurrences” mean those events that, in the opinion and discretion of the Committee, are outside the significant influence of the Participant or the Company and are likely to have a significant unanticipated effect, whether positive or negative, on the Company’s operating and/or financial results. 

^^^^^ 

^^Performance Goals. The vesting of an Award shall be subject to the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals, which shall be set forth in an Award Agreement. “Performance Goals” are one or more goals established by the Committee that relate to one or more Performance Criteria. “Performance Criteria” means any objective determination based on one or more of the following areas of performance of the Company, a subsidiary, or any division, department, or group of either which includes, but is not limited to: earnings, cash flow, revenue, financial ratios, market performance, shareholder return, operating income or profits (including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), earnings per share, return on assets, return on equity, return on investment, stock price, expense reduction, systems conversion, special projects as determined by the Committee, increases in book value, and acquisition integration initiatives. Performance Goals shall be established by the Committee prior to the issuance of an Award. 

^^Establishment of Performance Goals. Performance Goals for Performance Periods commencing on and after [[[Date 1]]], will be communicated to Participants in writing after they have been established by the Committee. 

^^Achievement Level. Three achievement levels will be defined for each Performance Goal. 

^^^Threshold. The “Threshold” achievement level is the minimum achievement level accepted for a Performance Goal. 

^^^Target. The “Target” achievement level is the planned achievement level for a Performance Goal. 

^^^Maximum. The “Maximum” achievement level is achievement that substantially exceeds the Target achievement level. 

^^[Interpolation. Achievement levels between Threshold  Target and Target  Maximum will be interpolated in a consistent manner as determined by the Committee.] 

Section  3.3  Earning and Vesting of Awards. Generally, an Award will become earned, and therefore vested, if: 

^^the applicable Performance Goals for the Performance Period are satisfied; and 

^^the Participant is actively employed on the last day of the Performance Period. 

The value of Awards will be calculated in accordance with the applicable Award Agreement. 

^^^^^ 

^^Effect of Termination of Service. 

^^In General. If a Participant incurs a Termination of Service for any reason other than a reason set forth in subsection 3.4(b), then any portion of an Award which has not otherwise become vested as of the date of Termination of Service will be forfeited, effective as of the date of such termination. For purposes of the Plan, “Termination of Service” means the occurrence of any act or event or any failure to act, that actually or effectively causes or results in a Participant ceasing, for whatever reason, to be an employee of the Company, including, but not limited to, death, Disability, retirement, termination by the Company of the Participant’s employment (whether for Cause or otherwise), and voluntary resignation or termination by the Participant of his or her employment for any reason. 

^^Termination Due to Death, Disability, or after Age 65. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.3 and subsection 3.4(a), if a Participant incurs an involuntary Termination of Service due to death or Disability after reaching age 55 or 10 years of service with the Company, any portion of an Award which has not otherwise become vested as of the date of such Termination of Service will be treated as earned and vested, effective as of the date of such Termination of Service, at the Target level and in a pro rata manner equivalent to the period of time during the Performance Periods the Participant participated in the Plan prior to the Termination of Service. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.3 and subsection 3.4(a), if a Participant incurs a Termination of Service for any reason other than by the Company for Cause after reaching age 65, any portion of his or her Award eligible to become earned and vested in the Performance Periods in which the termination occurs will, to the extent the Performance Goals for such Performance Periods are satisfied, be treated as earned and vested, effective as of the last day of such Performance Periods in which the Termination of Service occurs, in a pro rata manner equivalent to the period of time during the Performance Periods the Participant participated in the Plan. 

^^^For purposes of the Plan, “Disability” means “permanent and total disability” as defined in Code Section 22(e)(3). 

^^^For purposes of the Plan, “Cause” will mean “cause” as defined under a Participant’s employment agreement with the Company or if there is no such agreement, or if such agreement does not define “cause,” “Cause” will mean: 

^any government regulatory agency recommends or orders in writing that the Company or a subsidiary terminate the employment of a Participant or relieve him or her of his or her duties; 

^a Participant is convicted of or enters a plea of guilty or *nolo contendere* to a felony, a crime of falsehood, or a crime involving fraud or moral turpitude, or the actual incarceration of a Participant for a period of 45 consecutive days; 

^a determination by the Committee that a Participant willfully failed to follow the lawful instructions of the Board or any officer of the Company or a subsidiary after such Participant’s receipt of written notice of such instructions, other than a failure resulting from the Participant’s Disability; 

^^^^^ 
^a determination by the Committee that a Participant willfully or continuously failed to substantially and satisfactorily perform his duties with the Company or a subsidiary (other than any such failure resulting from the Participant’s Disability), within a reasonable period of time after a demand for substantial performance or notice of lack of substantial or satisfactory performance is delivered to the Participant; or 

^a determination by the Committee that a Participant has failed to conform to an applicable code of conduct of the Company. 

For purposes of the Plan, no act, or failure to act, on a Participant’s part shall be deemed “willful” unless done, or omitted to be done, by such Participant not in good faith and without reasonable belief that such Participant’s action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. In addition, term “code of conduct” shall meant the policies and procedures related to employment of employees by the Company or a subsidiary set forth in the Company’s employee handbook or any similar document. The code of conduct may be amended and updated at any time. The term “code of conduct” shall also include any other policy or procedure that may be adopted by the Company or a subsidiary and communicated to employees. 

Section  3.5  Effect of Change in Control. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 3.3 and 3.4, if a Change in Control of the Company occurs, then any portion of an Award which has not otherwise become vested as of the date of the Change in Control will be treated as earned and vested, effective as of the date of the Change in Control, at the Target level and in a pro rata manner equivalent to the period of time during the Performance Periods the Participant participated in the Plan prior to the Change in Control. “Change in Control” of the Company will mean a “Change in Control” as defined in the Penn Millers Stock Incentive Plan, as may be amended from time to time. 

Section  3.6  Payment of Awards; Open Market Purchases. 

^^A Final Award will be paid in a single sum cash payment by [[Date 2: Date]] of the year following the year in which the Award becomes vested. Compensation will be paid upon approval by the Committee. However, in the event of a Change in Control, payment of a Final Award will be made in a single sum on the date on which the Change in Control occurs. 

^^Within 30 days following payment of a Final Award to a Participant, the Participant shall purchase on the open market the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the value of such Final Award (less applicable federal, state, and local taxes) divided by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of such purchase, rounding any fractional shares to the nearest lower whole share. Within 30 days following such purchase of such shares of Common Stock, the Participant will submit proof of such purchase to the satisfaction of the Committee. The Committee will develop appropriate procedures for Participants to demonstrate the purchase of shares of Common Stock on the open market in accordance with this subsection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Final Award is paid to a Participant at or following his or her Termination of Service as provided in subsection 3.4(b) or a Change in Control, the provisions of this subsection 3.6(b) shall not apply with respect to such Final Award. 

^^^^^ 
^^In the event that the Committee determines in its sole discretion that a Participant fails to comply with the requirements of subsection 3.6(b) above, the Committee shall have the right to recover, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the value of the most recent Final Award (less applicable federal, state, and local taxes) paid to the Participant. 

^^Nothing in this Section 3.6 shall preclude the Committee from providing additional restrictions with respect to the transfer of Common Stock purchased by reason of the requirements of subsection 3.6(b). 

^^Shares purchased pursuant to subsection 3.6(b) shall be subject to the Company’s insider trading policy (including but not limited to any blackout period), securities pre-clearance policy, stock ownership guidelines, and any other restrictions that may be imposed from time to time on the Company’s employees by the Company or applicable law. 

^^For purposes of the Plan, “Common Stock” means the common stock of the Company (par value $[[USD Value 1: Number]] per share) as described in the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, or such other stock as shall be substituted therefor. 

Section  3.7  Forfeiture and Recovery of Awards. 

^^Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Company reserves the right to withhold, reduce, eliminate, amend, modify or suspend Awards or the payment of Final Awards based on a Participant’s failure to adhere to the Company’s stock ownership guidelines. 

^^Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if a Participant shall engage in any “harmful activity” (as defined herein) while employed by the Company or a subsidiary or during the six-month period thereafter, then (a) all amounts of cash received by the Participant in connection with the payment of a Final Award shall inure to the benefit of the Company and (b) any and all Awards that have not yet vested and any and all Final Awards that have not yet been paid shall immediately be forfeited. If any cash inures to the benefit of the Company under this subsection, the Participant shall pay cash to the Company within 30 days after receiving written notice from the Company that the Participant has engaged in a harmful activity. The determination by the Committee as to whether a Participant engaged in “harmful activity” while employed by the Company or a subsidiary or during the six-month period thereafter shall be final and conclusive, unless otherwise determined by a majority of disinterested members of the Board. 

^^A “harmful activity” shall have occurred if a Participant shall do any one or more of the following: 

^^^Engage in any fraud or intentional misconduct that is a significant contributing factor to the Company having to restate all or a portion of its financial statement(s). 

^^^Engage in activities that would constitute grounds for the Company or a subsidiary to terminate the Participant’s employment by reason of a Termination or Dismissal for Cause (as defined in the Company’s Stock Incentive Plan) or for Cause (as defined in an applicable employment agreement between the Participant and the Company and/or a subsidiary), whether or not the Participant is employed at the time the Participant engages in such activities. 

^^^^^ 
^^^Solicit or hire any employees of the Company or a subsidiary or induce any of such employees to terminate their employment relationship with the Company or a subsidiary. 

^^^Solicit, induce, or attempt to solicit or induce any customer, supplier, or other entity doing business with the Company of a subsidiary to cease doing business with the Company or a subsidiary or, in the case of a customer, to place agribusiness insurance, as that term is commonly understood in the industry, with any competitor of the Company or a subsidiary. For purposes of the foregoing provision, the term “customer” shall mean a business that the Company or a subsidiary insures on the date that the Participant’s employment terminates (or has insured during the previous twelve months) and a broker who has placed business with the Company or a subsidiary on the date that the Participant’s employment terminates but only with respect to those clients of the broker for which the broker has placed business with the Company or a subsidiary in the 12-month period preceding the date that the Participant’s employment terminates. 

^^^Directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, render services for (as a consultant or an advisor), or accept any employment with (i) Nationwide Agribusiness Insurance Company, Michigan Millers Insurance Company, or Westfield Insurance Company, or any of their successors in interest or (ii) the agribusiness insurance business of any other insurance company whose business has, or could reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s or a subsidiary’s business insurance business. 

^^^Directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, render services for (as a consultant or an adviser), or accept any employment with, within a 50-mile radius of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, any other property and casualty insurance or reinsurance line of business to the extent that such ownership, management, operating, rendering of services, or employment (and the activities necessarily incident thereto) have, or could reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s or a subsidiary’s business insurance business. 

^^^For any reason, in any fashion, form or manner, either directly or indirectly, divulge, disclose or communicate to any person, firm, corporation, or other business entity, in any manner whatsoever, any confidential information or trade secrets concerning the business of the Company or a subsidiary, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any customer lists or other customer identifying information, the techniques, methods or systems of the Company’s or a subsidiary’s operations or management, any information regarding their respective financial matters, or any other material information concerning the business of the Company or a subsidiary, their manner of operation, plan, or other material data.
