^^^GC China owns [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the outstanding stock of Luckcharm, which owns [[Percentage 1]]% of the outstanding stock of Wuhan. GC China, Luckcharm, Wuhan, WGST, ZJN and their respective predecessors, successors, assigns and affiliates shall collectively be referred to herein as the “GC China Group.”

^^^On [[Date 2: Date]], Wuhan and Deltawind signed a Technical License Contract (the “Technical License”). The Technical License granted Wuhan certain rights with respect to certain manufacturing technology and know-how owned or developed by Deltawind.

^^^On [[Date 2]], WGST, ZJN, and Deltawind signed a Foreign Equity Joint Venture Contract (the "Equity Joint Venture Contract"). In [[Date 3: Date]] Wuhan was incorporated.

^^^The Nordic Group has never been a party to the China JV Agreements.

^^^In accordance with an Asset Transfer Agreement between Nordic UK and Deltawind dated [[Date 7: Date]] (the “Asset Transfer Agreement”), Nordic UK acquired certain rights related to the wind turbine technology and know-how owned or developed by Deltawind.

^^^The GC China Group has never been a party to the Asset Transfer Agreement.

^^^Subsequent to the consummation of the Asset Transfer Agreement, the Parties have unresolved disagreements with regard to their respective rights and obligations in relation to the Technical License and the China JV Agreements.

^^^Nordic USA is the owner of U.S. Trademark Registration No. 3,536,392 for the mark NORDIC WINDPOWER for use in connection with wind turbines and wind-powered electricity generators and U.S. Trademark Registration No. 3,536,393 for the mark NORDIC WINDPOWER & Design for use in connection with wind turbines and wind-powered electricity generators.

^^^GC China is the owner of certain trademarks and trademark registrations in China that include the word NORDIC.

^^^On [[Date 8: Date]], Nordic USA instituted civil case no. 09-03672-PJH in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that GC China was engaged in activities that infringed the Nordic Group’s rights and caused confusion in the Nordic Group’s target audiences (the “Lawsuit”).

^^^GC China has answered and vigorously disputes the Lawsuit.

^^^The Nordic Group and Deltawind, on the one hand, and the GC China Group, on the other hand, now wish to reach a full and final settlement of the Lawsuit and all other disputes among them and to terminate all agreements, arrangements, relationships and understandings among them other than as set forth in this Agreement.

^^^For purposes of this Agreement, “China” or PRC” shall mean the People’s Republic of China, which shall include Macau and Hong Kong SAR, but expressly excludes Taiwan.

**Now Therefore****,** in consideration of the respective promises, and the terms, conditions, provisions and covenants of this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

Without regard to the foregoing, the Parties hereby agree that the Technical License is hereby terminated effective as of the Effective Date of this Agreement in any and all jurisdictions. All past, present and future rights and obligations under the Technical License shall be null, void and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Date of this Agreement.

The Nordic Group will, at its expense and the GC China Group’s request, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the GC China Group and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors and agents against any and all Claims (including reasonable attorneys’ and other reasonable professionals’ fees and costs) arising, in whole or in part, in connection with any breach of this Agreement (including any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein) by the Nordic Group; provided that the GC China Group shall promptly notify the Nordic Group in writing about any such claim and if prejudice occurs as a result of the GC China Group’s delay in providing notice, then the Nordic Group shall not be liable for any losses that directly result from the delay of providing such notice to the extent of such prejudice.

^^**Indemnification Procedure**. A person or entity that intends to claim indemnification under this Section 10 (an “Indemnitee”) must promptly notify the other Party (the “Indemnitor”) in writing of any Claim in respect of which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification, and the Indemnitor will assume the defense thereof whether or not such Claim is rightfully brought; provided, however, that an Indemnitee will have the right to take sole control of the defense and retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnitee, unless Indemnitor does not assume the defense, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnitee will be paid by the Indemnitor. The Indemnitee, and its employees and agents, will cooperate fully with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigations of any Claim. The Indemnitor may not enter into any settlement or compromise unless such settlement or compromise unconditionally releases the Indemnitee from all liability for all Claims or unless such settlement or compromise is consented to in writing by the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnitor will not be liable for the indemnification of any Claim settled or compromised by the Indemnitee without the written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
