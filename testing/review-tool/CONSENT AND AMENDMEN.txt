^Consent. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7 below and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in Section 8 below, Agent and Lenders hereby consent to the consummation of the Punch Acquisition by Encore pursuant to the terms of the Punch Acquisition Agreement. This is a limited consent and shall not be deemed to constitute a consent or waiver of any other term, provision or condition of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, as applicable, or to prejudice any right or remedy that Agent or any Lender may now have or may have in the future under or in connection with the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document.
