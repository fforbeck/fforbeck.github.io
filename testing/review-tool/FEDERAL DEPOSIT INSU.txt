Any increase in Leverage Ratio and total Risk-Based Capital necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph 3 of this ORDER may not be accomplished through a negative provision to the Bank’s ALLL.

^^If all or part of the increase in Leverage Ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital required by paragraph 3 of this ORDER is accomplished by the sale of securities, the Board shall adopt and implement a plan for the sale of such additional securities, including the voting of any shares owned or proxies held or controlled by them in favor of the plan. Should the implementation of the plan involve a public distribution of the Bank’s securities (including a distribution limited only to the Bank’s existing shareholders), the Bank shall prepare offering materials fully describing the securities being offered, including an accurate description of the financial condition of the Bank and the circumstances giving rise to the offering, and any other materials disclosures necessary to comply with Federal securities laws.

^^In complying with the provisions of paragraph 3 of this ORDER, the Bank shall provide to any subscriber and/or purchaser of the Bank’s securities, a written notice of any planned or existing development or other changes, which are materially different from the information reflected in any offering materials used in connection with the sale of Bank securities.

Such analysis shall be accomplished in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s Instructions for the Reports of Condition and Income, Interagency Statements of Policy on the ALLL, and other applicable regulatory guidance that addresses the adequacy of the Bank’s ALLL. Elimination of any of these assets through proceeds of other loans made by the Bank is not considered collection for purposes of this paragraph.
