**NATURAL SODA HOLDINGS, INC** of 3200 County Rd. 31, Rifle, Colorado USA and **NATURAL SODA, INC** of 3200 County Rd. 31, Rifle, Colorado USA (each a **Licensee**).

**BACKGROUND**  
^The parties have executed and delivered a License Agreement dated [[Date 4]]; and

^The parties wish to amend Section 4.2 of the License Agreement on the terms set forth herein.

**THE PARTIES AGREE** as follows:   
^Section 4.2 of the License Agreement is amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

^^Right of First Offer   
^^PJC grants to the Licensee the right of first refusal to engage in the Prohibited Activities (“**Pre-emptive Right”**) should PJC at any time during the Term of this Agreement decide to permit a third party (other than the Licensee) to engage in the Prohibited Activities.

^^If PJC decides to permit an independent third party (other than the Licensee) to engage in the Prohibited Activities, PJC must inform the Licensee of:

^^^that decision by written notice; and

^^^the key terms and conditions under which PJC is considering permitting the third party to engage in the Prohibited Activities.

^^If the Licensee wishes to exercise the Pre-emptive Right, the Licensee and PJC shall, within 21 days of the exercise of the Pre-emptive Right, enter into a written agreement on a similar basis to the key terms and conditions referred to under clause 4.2(b)(ii).
