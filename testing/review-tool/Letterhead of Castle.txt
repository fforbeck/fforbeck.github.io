PacWest Bancorp 401 West "A" Street [[Address 1: Address]] Attention: Victor R. Santoro 

Dear Vic: 

This letter agreement (the "Agreement") will confirm that, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, PacWest Bancorp (the "Company") has engaged Castle Creek Financial LLC ("Castle Creek") as the exclusive financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Company's efforts to (a) acquire or invest in other financial institutions, excepting therefrom the opening of individual bank branches in the ordinary course of business or acquisition of deposit bases, loan pools or failed institutions from the FDIC; (b) effect a sale of the Company or a material amount of its assets; or (c) pursue a financing or recapitalization transaction (collectively, the "Transaction"). As the exclusive financial advisor to the Company, Castle Creek will, in addition to providing services in connection with a proposed Transaction provide other services pursuant to paragraph 9. This Agreement amends and restates the letter agreement between the Company and Castle Creek dated as of [[Date 2: Date]]. 

^In connection with a proposed Transaction, at the request of the Company, Castle Creek will provide such services as the Company shall reasonably request including: (i) assisting the Company in the structuring of the financial aspects of a Transaction; (ii) identifying alternative potential parties and contacting such parties as the Company may designate; (iii) assist the Company in negotiating the terms of a Transaction with such parties; (iv) assisting the Company in communicating the strategic implications of the Transaction to the investment community; and (v) advising the Company in connection with its efforts to raise any additional capital that may be required to facilitate the Transaction. Further, Castle Creek and the Company expressly acknowledge that the fees provided for under paragraph 3 for a completed Transaction were determined in light of the fact that significant financial advisory services are rendered to the Company in connection with potential Transactions that are not successfully completed. Thus, such fees earned pursuant to paragraph 3 will serve as compensation for services rendered in connection with a completed Transaction and in connection with potential Transactions that are not successfully completed. Further, such fees are in recognition of the exclusive arrangement between Castle Creek and the Company, and Castle Creek's commitment to source and present opportunities in the Company's geographic market and niche for the Company's sole consideration and decision before presenting such opportunities to any third party. 

^In connection with a proposed Transaction, you will furnish Castle Creek with such material regarding the business and financial condition of the Company as we reasonably request, all of which will be accurate and complete in all material respects at the time furnished in writing. The Company will also use its reasonable best efforts to assure that its personnel, consultants, experts, attorneys and accountants are made available to Castle Creek upon Castle Creek's reasonable request in connection with services provided or to be provided by Castle Creek. While any proposed Transaction may be pending that was initiated during the term of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly notify Castle Creek of (i) any material changes in the business or financial condition of the Company from the written information provided to Castle Creek, and (ii) any material events or developments relating to the financial condition or business operations or prospects of the Company and promptly make available for Castle Creek's review copies of all filings related to the Transaction made by the Company with any regulatory agency and copies of all press releases related to the Transaction issued by the Company. We are relying, without independent verification, on the accuracy and completeness of all information furnished to us in 

^In consideration of the services to be provided hereunder, the Company agrees to pay to Castle Creek the following cash fees:  

^In the event that a sale of the Company is completed, an amount equal to one percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the Transaction Value (as defined below) for the Transaction. 

^In the event that an acquisition of or investment in another financial institution is completed by the Company, an amount based upon the following schedule will be owed to Castle Creek upon the consummation of the acquisition or investment based upon the Transaction Value for the Transaction, net of the cost of a "fairness opinion" if such opinion is deemed necessary:

**Deal Value ($ in millions)**            **Fees** (1)      If      $[[USD Value 2: Number]]<$[[USD Value 3: Number]]      then      [[Percentage 1]]% of the Transaction Value (2)      If      Over $[[USD Value 3]]      then      $[[USD Value 1: Number]] plus [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the amount of the Transaction Value in excess of $[[USD Value 3]] million.

^Regardless of whether a Transaction is completed, the Company will reimburse Castle Creek, upon its demand, for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including travel expenses and fees and disbursements of counsel retained by Castle Creek in connection with this engagement). In seeking such reimbursement, Castle Creek shall provide an explanation of such charges. 

^The Company agrees to indemnify and hold Castle Creek harmless in accordance with the terms and conditions of Appendix A attached hereto and made a part hereof as though fully set forth in this Agreement. No termination or modification hereof, or completion of Castle Creek's engagement hereunder, shall limit or affect such indemnification. 

^Castle Creek's services hereunder may be terminated by the Company or Castle Creek at any time upon 30 days written notice, provided that Castle Creek shall be entitled to any fees payable pursuant to Section 3 and Section 8 hereof in the event that the Company completes a Transaction (i) on which Castle Creek provided advice or participated in discussions with any of the investors in such Transaction or (ii) with any of the parties as to which Castle Creek advised the Company or with whom the Company engaged in discussions regarding a possible Transaction prior to the termination of this Agreement, providing that such Transaction is completed within eighteen months following the termination of this Agreement. In addition, Castle Creek shall remain entitled to the reimbursement of fees and expenses under the terms and conditions described in 

^In order to coordinate our efforts with respect to any Transaction for which the Company intends to engage a financial advisor, during the period of our engagement hereunder if the Company or its management receives an inquiry regarding a Transaction, they will promptly advise Castle Creek of such inquiry in order that we can evaluate such prospective party and its interest and assist the Company in any resulting negotiations. 

^Pursuant to section 3(C) hereinabove, it is understood and agreed that if the Company decides to pursue a financing or recapitalization Transaction for which Castle Creek is to provide any of the financial advisory services described above in Section 1 hereof, the Company and Castle Creek shall negotiate in good faith acceptable compensation for Castle Creek in consideration of such services, which compensation will take into account, among other things, the results obtained and the custom and practice among investment bankers acting in similar situations. The compensation owed to Castle Creek in accordance with the fee structure agreed upon by the Company and Castle Creek in respect of a financing or recapitalization Transaction shall be paid to Castle Creek in cash upon the completion of any such Transaction. It is understood that no separate fee will be owed to Castle Creek in consideration of services in connection with a financing or recapitalization Transaction if such Transaction is undertaken in connection with a Transaction described in Section 3(B) above. 

^It is understood and agreed that Castle Creek will provide such other services that may from time to time be mutually agreed upon by Castle Creek and the Company. Castle Creek expressly acknowledges that it will not be compensated specifically for these services other than the reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, but that such fees earned from acting as a financial advisor to the Company for a Transaction will serve as compensation to Castle Creek for such non-Transaction services rendered. Such services rendered to the Company not directly related to a specific Transaction may include, but are not exclusive to (i) the development and preparation of long term financial and strategic plans, (ii) assistance with investor and public relations, and (iii) capital management advisory services. 

^Except as expressly provided herein, no fee paid or payable to Castle Creek or any of its affiliates shall be used as an offset or credit against any other fee paid or payable to Castle Creek or any of its affiliates. 

^This Agreement, along with the indemnity in Appendix A and the Confidentiality Agreement attached hereto as Annex B, embody the sole terms of the agreement between the Company and Castle Creek with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all previous agreements, whether oral or written, between the Company and Castle Creek with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be altered, varied, revised or amended, except by an instrument in writing signed by both the Company and Castle Creek after the date first written above. The Company and Castle Creek have not made any other agreements or representations of any kind with respect to such subject matter. 

^This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to principles of conflict of laws. To the extent legally permissible, any right to trial by jury with respect to any claim or proceeding related to or arising out of this engagement or any transaction or conduct in connection herewith, is waived. Any claim or dispute arising out of this Agreement or the alleged breach thereof shall be submitted by the parties to binding and nonappealable arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in [[Address 2: Address]], under the commercial rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided 

^This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall continue one and the same instrument. This Agreement may be executed by the exchange of facsimile signatures, which shall have the same force and effect as if original signatures had been exchanged. 

^The Company expressly acknowledges that Castle Creek has been retained solely as an advisor to the Company, and not as an advisor to or agent of any other person, and that the Company's engagement of Castle Creek is not intended to confer rights upon any persons not a party hereto (including shareholders, employees or creditors of the Company) as against Castle Creek, Castle Creek's affiliates or their respective directors, officers, agents and employees. Any advice provided to the Company by Castle Creek pursuant to this Agreement is solely for the information and assistance of the executive management and Board of Directors of the Company. Such advice shall be treated as confidential information and shall not be disclosed to any third party except in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Any reference to Castle Creek or to any affiliate of Castle Creek in any release or communication to any party outside the Company is subject to Castle Creek's prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Castle Creek shall not refer to the Company in any written materials (other than performance overviews and marketing materials related thereto that may be distributed to both prospective and current investors and clients of Castle Creek and its affiliates) without the Company's prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If this Agreement is terminated prior to any release or communication, no reference shall be made to Castle Creek without Castle Creek's prior written approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein is intended to prevent the Company from complying with any disclosure obligations under applicable law, without seeking Castle Creek's consent. 

^Neither the Company nor Castle Creek may assign, transfer, license, or sublicense its rights under this Agreement without the other party's prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld in the other party's sole and absolute discretion. Subject to the limitation in this paragraph, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon both the Company and Castle Creek and their respective successors and assigns. 

^Castle Creek represents that it has the necessary expertise to provide the services contemplated by this Agreement and that the compensation provided for herein is fair and reasonable and comparable to the compensation that would be charged by an independent provider of such services with the same type, level and quality of expertise. The Company acknowledges that the services contemplated herein will meet legitimate needs of the Company and that it is in the best interests of the Company to obtain such services. 

^After closing a Transaction, Castle Creek shall have the right to place advertisements in financial and other newspapers and other newspapers and journals at its own expense describing its services to the Company under this Agreement, provided that Castle Creek shall have submitted a copy of any such proposed advertisements to the Company for its prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
