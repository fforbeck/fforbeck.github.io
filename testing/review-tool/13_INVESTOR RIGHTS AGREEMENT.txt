The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party under this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.

^^The indemnification required by this Section 6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or Indemnified Damages are incurred.

^^The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (i) any cause of action or similar right of the Company Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law.

^**Contribution**. To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that: (i) no Person involved in the sale of Registrable Securities which Person is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) in connection with such sale shall be entitled to contribution from any Person involved in such sale of Registrable Securities who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation; and (ii) contribution by any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant hereto were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method or allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to herein.

^**Assignment of Registration Rights**. The registration rights provided pursuant to Sections 2 through 10 of this Agreement shall be assignable in full or in part by the Purchaser to any transferee of such Purchaser’s Registrable Securities if: (i) the Purchaser agrees in writing with the transferee or assignee to assign such rights, and a copy of such agreement is furnished to the Company within a reasonable time after such assignment; (ii) the Company is, contemporaneous with such transfer or assignment, furnished with written notice of (a) the name and address of such transferee or assignee, and (b) the Registrable Securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned; and (iii) at or before the time the Company receives the written notice contemplated by clause (ii) of this sentence the transferee or assignee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of the provisions contained herein.

^**Amendment**. Provisions of this Agreement may be amended and the observance thereof may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only with the written consent of the Company and the Required Holders (or, in the case of an amendment to or wavier of the second sentence of Section 12 adversely affecting the rights of holders of Preferred Stock, the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding). Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 9 shall be binding upon the Purchaser and the Company. No such amendment shall be effective to the extent that it applies to less than all of the holders of the Registrable Securities.

^**Preservation of** **Rights****.** Except with the prior consent of the Required Holders, the Company shall not, for so long as there are Registrable Securities, (a) grant any registration rights to third parties that are inconsistent with the rights granted hereunder, or (b) enter into any agreement, take any action, or permit any change to occur, with respect to its securities that violates or subordinates the rights expressly granted to the holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement.

^**Rule 144 Compliance****.** With a view to making available to the holders of Registrable Securities the benefits of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and any other rule or regulation of the Commission that may at any time permit a holder to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration on Form S-3 (or any successor form), the Company shall:

^^make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 at all times; and

^^use its commercially reasonable best efforts to file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

^**Voting Rights**. Each Purchaser shall have the voting rights of a holder of the Preferred Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Determination for the Preferred Stock. In addition, until a Special Voting Right Termination Event occurs, the Company shall not incur or issue any additional debt, other than trade debt incurred in the normal course and commercial bank working capital debt, whether revolving or term debt, without the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding.

^**Miscellaneous**.

^^A Person is deemed to be a holder of Registrable Securities whenever such Person owns or is deemed to own of record such Registrable Securities.

^^Any notices, consents, waivers or other communications required or permitted to be given under the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been delivered: (i) upon receipt, when delivered personally, (ii) upon receipt, when sent by facsimile (provided confirmation of transmission is mechanically or electronically generated and kept on file by the sending party), so long as such facsimile is followed by mail delivery of the same information contained in such facsimile, or (iii) one Business Day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, in each case properly addressed to the party to receive the same. The addresses for such communications shall be:

^^Failure of any party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement or otherwise, or delay by a party in exercising such right or remedy, shall not operate as a waiver thereof.

^^All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdictions other than the State of California.

There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein and therein. This Agreement and the instruments referenced herein supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

^^Subject to the requirements of Section 8, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the permitted successors and assigns of each of the parties hereto.

^^The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

^^This Agreement may be executed in identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement, once executed by a party, may be delivered to the other party hereto by facsimile transmission of a copy of this Agreement bearing the signature of the party so delivering this Agreement.

^^Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be done and performed, all such further acts and things, and shall execute and deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as any other party may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

^^As used herein, “Dollar”, “US Dollar” and “$” each mean the lawful money of the United States.

^^The parties acknowledge that it would be impossible to fix money damages for violations of this Agreement and that such violations will cause irreparable injury for which an adequate remedy at law is not available. The parties hereby agree that any party hereto may, in its sole discretion, apply to any state or federal court in the State of California for specific performance or similar relief as such court may deem just and proper in order to enforce this Agreement or prevent any violation thereof and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each party waives any objection or defense to the imposition of such relief. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit any party from bringing any action for damages in addition to an action for specific performance or an injunction for a breach of this Agreement.
