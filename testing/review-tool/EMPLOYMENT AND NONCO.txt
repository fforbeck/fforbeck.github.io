^**Covenants of the Executive**. 

^^**No Conflicts**. The Executive represents and warrants that he is not personally subject to any agreement, order or decree, which restricts his acceptance of this Agreement and performance of his duties with the Company hereunder.

^^**Non-Competition**. During the Employment Term and for a period of time following the termination of the Employment Term equal to the greater of (i) one (1) year and (ii) the period of time during which the Executive receives Severance Pay (the “Restrictive Period”), the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever, either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity whom he may manage, control, participate in, consult with, render services for or be employed or associated, compete with the Business (as hereinafter defined) in any of the following described manners:

^^^Engage in, assist or have any interest in, as principal, consultant, advisor, agent, financier or employee, any business entity which is, or which is about to become engaged in, providing goods or services in competition with the Addus HealthCare Group within a geographic radius of thirty (30) miles from any Addus HealthCare Group branch office; or 

^^^Solicit or accept any business (or help any other person solicit or accept any business) from any person or entity which on the Effective Date is a customer of the Addus HealthCare Group or which during the Employment Term becomes a customer of the Addus HealthCare Group. 

For purposes hereof, the term “Business” means the business of providing home care services of the type and nature that the Addus HealthCare Group then performed and/or any other business activity in which the Addus HealthCare Group then performed or program or service then under active development proposed to be performed and/or any other business activity in which the Addus HealthCare Group becomes engaged in on or after the date hereof while the Executive is employed by the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from owning [[Percentage 4: Number]]% or less of any securities of a competitor, if such securities are listed on a nationally recognized securities exchange or traded over-the-counter. If, at the time of enforcement of this Section 9(b), a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under the circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum period, scope or geographic area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area determined to be reasonable under the circumstances by such court. 

^^**Non-Disclosure**.

^^**Covenant Regarding Confidential and Proprietary Information**.

^^^The Executive will promptly disclose in writing to the Company each improvement, discovery, idea, invention, and each proposed publication of any kind whatsoever, relating to the Business made or conceived by the Executive either alone or in conjunction with others while employed hereunder if such improvement, discovery, idea, invention or publication results from or was suggested by such employment (whether or not patentable and whether or not made or conceived at the request of or upon the suggestion of the Company, and whether or not during his usual hours of work, whether in or about the premises of the Addus HealthCare Group and whether prior or subsequent to the execution hereof). The Executive will not disclose any such improvement, discovery, idea, invention or publication to any person, entity or governmental authority, except to the Company. Each such improvement, discovery, idea, invention and publication shall be the sole and exclusive property of, and is hereby assigned by the Executive to, the Company, and at the request of the Company, the Executive will assist and cooperate with the Company and any person or entity from time to time designated by the Company to obtain for the Company or its designee the grant of any letters patent in the United States of America and/or such other country or countries as may be designated by the Company, covering any such improvement, discovery, idea, invention or publication and will in connection therewith execute such applications, statements, assignments or other documents, furnish such information and data and take all such other action (including, without limitation, the giving of testimony) as the Company may from time to time reasonably request. The foregoing provisions of this Section 9(d) shall not apply to any improvement, discovery, idea, invention of publication for which no equipment, supplies, facilities or confidential and proprietary information of Addus HealthCare Group was used and which was developed entirely on the Executive’s own time, unless (x) the improvement, discovery, idea, invention or publication relates to the Business or the actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Business, or (y) the improvement, discovery, idea, invention or publication results from any work performed by the Executive for the Addus HealthCare Group. 

^^^The Executive recognizes and acknowledges that he will have access to certain confidential and proprietary information of Addus HealthCare Group, including, but not limited to, Trade Secrets and other proprietary commercial information, and that such information constitutes valuable, special and unique property of Addus HealthCare Group. The Executive agrees that he will not, for any reason or purpose whatsoever, except in the 

performance of his duties hereunder, or as required by law, disclose any of such confidential information to any person, entity or governmental authority without express authorization of the Company. 

^^**Non-Disparagement**. The Executive agrees that, during the Employment Term and the Restrictive Period, he will not make any statement, either in writing or orally, that is communicated publicly or is reasonably likely to be communicated publicly, and that is reasonably likely to disparage or otherwise harm the business or reputation of the Addus HealthCare Group, or the reputation of any of its current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders.

^^**Return of Documents and Other Property**. Upon termination of employment, the Executive shall return all originals and copies of books, records, documents, customer lists, sales materials, tapes, keys, credit cards and other tangible property of Addus HealthCare Group within the Executive’s possession or under his control.

^^**Remedies for Breach**. In the event of a breach or threat of a breach of the provisions of this Section 9, the Executive hereby acknowledges that such breach or threat of a breach will cause the Company to suffer irreparable harm and that the Company shall be entitled to an injunction restraining the Executive from breaching such provisions; but the foregoing shall not be construed as prohibiting the Company from having available to it to any other remedy, either at law or in equity, for such breach or threatened breach, including, but not limited to, the immediate cessation of employment and any remaining Severance Pay and benefits pursuant to Section 8 and the recovery of damages from the Executive and the notification of any employer or prospective employer of the Executive as to the terms and conditions hereof (without limiting or affecting the Executive’s obligations under the other paragraphs of this Section 9).

^^**Acknowledgment**. The Executive acknowledges that he will be directly and materially involved as a senior executive in all important policy and operational decisions of Addus HealthCare Group. The Executive further acknowledges that the scope of the foregoing restrictions has been specifically bargained between the Company and the Executive, each being fully informed of all relevant facts. Accordingly, the Executive acknowledges that the foregoing restrictions of this Section 9 are fair and reasonable, are minimally necessary to protect Addus HealthCare Group, its stockholders and the public from the unfair competition of the Executive who, as a result of his employment with the Company, will have had access to the most confidential and important information of Addus HealthCare Group, its Business and future plans. The Executive furthermore acknowledges that no unreasonable harm or injury will be suffered by him from enforcement of the covenants contained herein and that he will be able to earn a reasonable livelihood

following termination of his employment notwithstanding enforcement of the covenants contained herein.

^^^**Right of Set Off**. In the event of a breach by the Executive of the provisions of this Agreement, the Company is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and after ten (10) days prior written notice to the Executive, to set-off and apply any and all amounts at any time held by the Company on behalf of the Executive and all indebtedness at any time owing by the Addus HealthCare Group to the Executive against any and all of the obligations of the Executive now or hereafter existing.

^**Prior Agreement**. This Agreement supersedes and is in lieu of any and all other employment arrangements between the Executive and the Company or its predecessor or any subsidiary and any and all such employment agreements and arrangements are hereby terminated and deemed of no further force or effect. 

^**Assignment**. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or duties of the Executive hereunder shall be assignable by the Executive and any such purported assignment by him shall be void. The Company may assign all or any of its rights hereunder. 

^**Notices**. Unless specified in this Agreement, all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given upon receipt or refusal thereof if delivered personally, sent by overnight courier service, mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), postage prepaid, or emailed to the other party’s email address on the Company’s computer network.

Terms used herein that are defined in the Plan shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. If there is any inconsistency between the terms of this Award Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the Plan’s terms shall supersede and replace the conflicting terms herein.

Said exercise price is equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of the Option. The Shares subject to the Option are referred to herein as the “**Option Shares**.” 

^Type of Option. The Option is a Nonqualified Stock Option which is not intended to be governed by Section 422 of the Code and will be interpreted accordingly. 

^Expiration Date. The Option shall expire on the expiration date set forth above (the “**Expiration Date**”) unless the Option expires earlier as provided in Section 6 of this Award 

Agreement. 

^Vesting of Option. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the provisions of this Award Agreement (including the requirement in Section 6 that the Option Holder continue to be employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries on the dates set forth below), the Option will be exercisable in accordance with the following schedule:

^^If the Option Holder is entitled to exercise the vested and exercisable portion of the Option, and wishes to do so, in whole or part, the Option Holder shall deliver to the Company a fully completed and executed notice of exercise, in such form as may be designated by the Company in its sole discretion, specifying the exercise date and the number of Option Shares to be purchased pursuant to such exercise.

^^The Company’s obligation to deliver Option Shares to the Option Holder under this Award Agreement is subject to and conditioned upon the Option Holder satisfying all tax obligations associated with the Option Holder’s receipt, holding and exercise of the Option. Unless otherwise approved by the Committee, all such tax obligations shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. 

^^The Company and its affiliates and Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct from any compensation otherwise due to the Option Holder the amount necessary to satisfy all such taxes.

^Discretionary Plan; Employment. The Plan is discretionary in nature and may be suspended or terminated by the Company at any time. With respect to the Plan, (a) each grant of an Option is a one-time benefit which does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Options, or benefits in lieu of Options; (b) all determinations with respect to any such future grants, including, but not limited to, the times when the Option shall be granted, the number of Option Shares, the Option Price, and the times when each Option shall be exercisable, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (c) if the Option Holder is an Employee, the Option Holder’s participation in the Plan shall not create a right to further or continued employment with the Option Holder’s employer and shall not interfere with the ability of the Option Holder’s employer to terminate the Option Holder’s employment relationship at any time with or without cause; (d) the Option Holder’s participation in the Plan is voluntary; (e) the 

Option is not part of normal and expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payment, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits, or similar payments; (f) the future value of the Shares underlying the Option is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; (g) if the underlying Shares do not increase in value, the Option will have no value; and (h) the ability of the Option Holder to sell Shares acquired pursuant to the Option may be limited by applicable securities laws.

^Transfer Restrictions. The Option Shares may not be sold or otherwise disposed of in any manner that would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities laws.
