The Committee acting in its absolute discretion shall exercise such powers and take such action as expressly called for under this Plan and, further, the Committee shall have the power to interpret this Plan and (subject to § 15 and § 16 and Rule 16b-3) to take such other action in the administration and operation of this Plan as the Committee deems equitable under the circumstances, which action shall be binding on the Company, on each affected Eligible Employee or Director and on each other person directly or indirectly affected by such action. Furthermore, the Committee as a condition to making any grant under this Plan to any Eligible Employee or Director shall have the right to require him or her to execute an agreement which makes th e Eligible Employee or Director subject to non-competition provisions and other restrictive covenants which run in favor of the Company.

**§ .**

\centered **ELIGIBILITY**

Only Eligible Employees shall be eligible for a grant of ISOs under this Plan, and only Eligible Employees shall be eligible to participate in any Cash Incentive Program.

**§ .**

\centered **OPTIONS**

^^**Committee Action**. The Committee acting in its absolute discretion shall have the right to grant Options to Eligible Employees and to Directors under this Plan from time to time to purchase shares of Stock, but the Committee shall not (subject to § 14) take any action, whether through amendment, cancellation, replacement grants, or any other means, to reduce the Option Price of any outstanding Options absent the approval of the Company’s stockholders. Each grant of an Option to a Eligible Employee or Director shall be evidenced by an Option Certificate, and each Option Certificate shall set forth whether the Option is an ISO or a Non-ISO and shall set forth such other terms and conditions of such grant as the Committee acting in its absolute discretion deems consistent with the terms of this Plan; however, (a) if the Committee grants an ISO and a Non-ISO to a Eligible Employee on the same date, the right of the Eligible Employee to exercise the ISO shall not be conditioned on his or her failure to exercise the Non-ISO and (b) if the only condition to exercise of the Option is the completion of a period of ser vice, such period of service shall be no less than the one (1) year periodwhich starts on the date as of which the Option is granted unless the Committee determines that a shorter period of service (or no period of service) better serves the Company’s interest.

^^**$[[USD Value 1]] Limit**. No Option shall be treated as an ISO to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Stock subject to the Option which would first become exercisable in any calendar year exceeds $[[USD Value 4: Number]] Any such excess shall instead automatically be treated as a Non-ISO. The Committee shall interpret and administer the ISO limitation set forth in this § 7.2 in accordance with § 422(d) of the Code, and the Committee shall treat this § 7.2 as in effect only for those periods for which § 422(d) of the Code is in effect.

^^**Option Price**. The Option Price for each share of Stock subject to an Option shall be no less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date the Option is granted; provided, however, if the Option is an ISO granted to an Eligible Employee who is a Ten Percent Stockholder, the Option Price for each share of Stock subject to such ISO shall be no less than [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date such ISO is granted.

^^**Payment**. The Option Price shall be payable in full upon the exercise of any Option and, at the discretion of the Committee, an Option Certificate can provide for the payment of the Option Price either in cash, by check or in Stock which is acceptable to the Committee, through any cashless exercise procedure which is effected by an unrelated broker through a sale of Stock in the open market and which is acceptable to the Committee, by directing the Company to withhold shares of Stock otherwise issuable in connection with the exercise of the Option having a Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price, or in any combin ation of such forms of payment. Any payment made in Stock shall be treated as equal to the Fair Market Value of such Stock on the date the certificate for such Stock (or proper evidence of such certificate) is presented to the Committee or its delegate in such form as acceptable to the Committee.

^^**Exercise**.  
^^**Exercise Period**. Each Option granted under this Plan shall be exercisable in whole or in part at such time or times as set forth in the related Option Certificate, but no Option Certificate shall make an Option exercisable on or after the earlier of

^^^the date which is the fifth anniversary of the date the Option is granted, if the Option is an ISO and the Eligible Employee is a Ten Percent Stockholder on the date the Option is granted, or

^^^the date which is the tenth anniversary of the date the Option is granted, if the Option is (A) a Non-ISO or (B) an ISO which is granted to an Eligible Employee who is not a Ten Percent Stockholder on the date the Option is granted.

^^**Termination of Status as Eligible Employee or Director**. Subject to § 7.5(a), an Option Certificate may provide for the exercise of an Option after an Eligible Employee’s or a Director’s status as such has terminated for any reason whatsoever, including death or disability.

**§ .**

\centered **STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS**

^^**Committee Action**. The Committee acting in its absolute discretion shall have the right to grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible Employees and to Directors under this Plan from time to time, and each Stock Appreciation Right grant shall be evidenced by a Stock Appreciation Right Certificate or, if such Stock Appreciation Right is granted as part of an Option, shall be evidenced by the Option Certificate for the related Option.

^^**Terms and Conditions**.  
^^**Stock Appreciation Right Certificate**. If a Stock Appreciation Right is granted independent of an Option, such Stock Appreciation Right shall be evidenced by a Stock Appreciation Right Certificate, and such certificate shall set forth the number of shares of Stock on which the Eligible Employee’s or Director’s right to appreciation shall be based and the SAR Value of each share of Stock. Such SAR Value shall be no less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date that the Stock Appreciation Right is granted. The Stock Appreciation Right Certificate shall set forth such other terms and conditions for the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right as the Committee deems appropriate under the circumstances, but no Stock Appreciation Ri ght Certificate shall make a Stock Appreciation Right exercisable on or after the date which is the tenth anniversary of the date such Stock Appreciation Right is granted.

^^**Option Certificate**. If a Stock Appreciation Right is granted together with an Option, such Stock Appreciation Right shall be evidenced by an Option Certificate, the number of shares of Stock on which the Eligible Employee’s or Director’s right to appreciation shall be based shall be the same as the number of shares of Stock subject to the related Option, and the SAR Value for each such share of Stock shall be no less than the Option Price under the related Option. Each such Option Certificate shall provide that the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right with respect to any share of Stock shall cancel the Eligible Employee’s or Director’s right to exercise his or her Option with respect to such share and, conversely, that the exercise of the Option with respect to any share of Stock shall cancel the Eligible Employee’s or Director’s right to exercise his or her Stock Appreciation Right with respect to such share. A Stock Appreciation Right which is granted as part of an Option shall be exercisable only while the related Option is exercisable. The Option Certificate shall set forth such other terms and conditions for the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right as the Committee deems appropriate under the c ircumstances.

^^**Minimum Period of Service**. If the only condition to exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right is the completion of a period of service, such period of service shall be no less than the one (1) year period which starts on the date as of which the Stock Appreciation Right is granted unless the Committee determines that a shorter period of service (or no period of service) better serves the Company’s interest.

^^**Exercise**. A Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable only when the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on which the right to appreciation is based exceeds the SAR Value for such share, and the payment due on exercise shall be based on such excess with respect to the number of shares of Stock to which the exercise relates. An Eligible Employee or Director upon the exercise of his or her Stock Appreciation Right shall receive a payment from the Company in cash or in Stock issued under this Plan, or in a combination of cash and Stock, and the number of shares of Stock issued shall be based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised. The Committee acting in its absolute discretion shall have the right to determine the form and time of any payment under this § 8.3.

**§ .**

\centered **STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK UNIT GRANTS**

^^**Committee Action**. The Committee acting in its absolute discretion shall have the right to make Stock Grants and Stock Unit Grants to Eligible Employees and Directors. Each Stock Grant and each Stock Unit Grant shall be evidenced by a Stock Grant Certificate, and each Stock Grant Certificate shall set forth the conditions, if any, under which Stock will be issued under the Stock Grant or Stock Unit Grant or cash will be paid under the Stock Unit Grant and the conditions under which the Eligible Employee’s or Director’s interest in any Grant will become non-forfeitable.

^^**Conditions**.  
^^**Conditions to Issuance of Stock**. The Committee acting in its absolute discretion may make the issuance of Stock under a Stock Grant, or the issuance of Stock or payment in cash under a Stock Unit Grant, subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions which the Committee deems appropriate under the circumstances for Eligible Employees or Directors generally or for an Eligible Employee or a Director in particular, and the related Stock Grant Certificate shall set forth each such condition and the deadline for satisfying each such condition.
