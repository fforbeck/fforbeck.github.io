Bighorn understands that the aggregate purchase price for the Property, including the cost of delivery to Borrower in California, is approximately $[[USD Value 1: Number]] against which Borrower has paid cash deposits aggregating approximately $[[USD Value 2: Number]] and previously paid for equipment of $[[USD Value 3: Number]]
