^**Fees.** To compensate Advisor for its services pursuant to this Agreement, Client agrees to pay Advisor the following fees:

**Advisory Fee:** Client agrees to pay Advisor a non-refundable fee of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] (the “Advisory Fee”).

^^Equity: Two-percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the committed amount of any equity financing.

Notwithstanding the above fee schedule, a minimum fee of $[[USD Value 3: Number]] shall be due Advisor if Client closes a Transaction with a Prospective Party. During the initial term of this agreement the Client shall not incur a success fee obligation, either at the scheduled amount or the minimum amount noted in the prior sentence, if it raises less than $[[USD Value 4: Number]] in a single or in a series of debt or equity financing Transactions with existing investors in the CleanTech BioFuels.

^**No Representations.** Advisor makes no representations, expressed or implied, that it will effect a Transaction of Client as a result of the services furnished under this Agreement.
