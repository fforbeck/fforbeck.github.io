We have acted as counsel to [[VIRZ]] (the “**Company**”), in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of the Share Exchange Agreement dated as of April __, 2010 (the “**Agreement**”), by and among the Company, [[DK Pharmaceutical]] (“DK Pharmaceutical”), all of the DK Pharmaceutical shareholders, and the controlling shareholders of the Company. This opinion is given to you pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Agreement. **(Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined as set forth in the Agreement.)**

We have participated in the preparation and negotiation of the Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules thereto, and the other documents referred to therein.

In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined originals or copies of: (i) the Agreement and all other closing documents executed in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (the “**Transaction Documents**”), (ii) the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, as amended, as in effect on the date hereof (the “”) as attached hereto as **Exhibit “A”**, (iii) Certificate of Good Standing of the Secretary of the State of Nevada, as attached hereto as **Exhibit “B”** for the Company (the “ ;**Certificate**”), (iv) a certificate of an officer of the Company attached hereto as **Exhibit “C”** (the “Officer’s Certificate”), (v) resolutions (the “Resolutions”) of the Company’s Board of Directors attached hereto as **Exhibit “D”**, authorizing and approving the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, and (vi) the Company’s By-laws, as in effect on the date hereof (the “**By-laws**”) as attached hereto as **Exhibit “E”** and such certificates of public officials, corporate documents and records and other certificates, opinions, agreements and instruments and have made such other investigati ons as we have deemed necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth. In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have relied, as to factual matters, upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Agreement.

Based on the foregoing, subject to the qualifications stated herein and upon such investigation as we have deemed necessary, we give you our opinion as follows:

The Transaction Documents have been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except that (a) such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affectin g the enforcement of creditors’ rights in general and (b) the remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of injunctive relief may be subject to equitable defenses.

^There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board or body or any governmental agency or self-regulatory organization pending or threatened against or affecting the Company, wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would have a Material Adverse Effect or which would adversely affect the validity or enforceability of or the authority or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents.
