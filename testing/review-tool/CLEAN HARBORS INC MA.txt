\centered **[as amended and restated on [[Date 1: Date]]]**

^ \centered 1. Purposes.  
The purpose of the Clean Harbors, Inc. Management Incentive Plan (the “MIP”) is to provide each year a strong financial incentive for performance of senior managers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company’s Chief Executive Officer) by making available potential Annual MIP Bonuses payable in cash based upon the level of corporate performance or satisfaction of certain other objective goals for the year. The Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Committee”) shall be responsible for determining the terms and potential amounts of such Annual MIP Bonuses.

^ \centered 2. Definitions in Last Section. 

Unless defined where the term first appears in the MIP, capitalized terms shall have the respective meanings set forth in Section 6.

^ \centered 3. Potential MIP Bonuses. 

^^ \centered (a) *Establishment of Potential Annual MIP Bonuses*. On or before the 90th day of each Plan Year, the Committee shall determine and set forth in writing (i) the Performance Criteria for such Plan Year, and, where deemed appropriate by the Committee, a Threshold, Target and Maximum Level of Achievement for each such Performance Criteria, and (ii) the respective amounts of Annual MIP Bonuses (which shall be expressed as a percentage of each Participant’s Base Compensation for such Plan Year) which can potentially be earned based on attainment of each such Level of Achievement. Each of the Performance Criteria and the Levels of Achievement shall be objective such that a third party having knowledge of the relevant facts could determine (1) whether or not the Performance Criteria at each such Level of Achievement has been achieved and (2) the total amount of the Annual MIP Bonus (if any) for each Plan Year (expressed as a percentage of each Participant’s Base Compensation for such Plan Year) which has been earned based on such performance. To the extent that the Committee determines following the establishment of such Performance Criteria and Levels of Achievement for any Plan Year that a change (either an increase or a decrease) is appropriate in order to adjust for effects of extraordinary events (such as a material acquisition or change in accounting methods) as determined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which affect the calculation of such Criteria or Levels and which become effective during such Plan Year, the Committee shall have authority to make such change by setting forth the revised terms thereof in writing. Furthermore, in the case of each Participant who is a member of the Executive Staff and to whom the     

^^ \centered Committee determines that potential payment of a Supplemental Executive Incentive Bonus is appropriate, the Committee shall have authority to award a Supplemental Executive Incentive Bonus of up to a specified percentage of Base Compensation if such Participant meets or exceeds during a Plan Year the Personal Goals which are established by the Committee for such Participant on or before the 90th day of such Plan Year (or within 30 days after a Participant becomes a member of the Executive Staff during such Plan Year). 

^^ \centered (b) *Determination and Certification of Annual MIP Bonuses*. Prior to the payment date for each Plan Year which is described in Section 3(e) below, the Committee shall determine and certify in writing to the Board (i) whether or not each of the Performance Criteria for such Plan Year has been satisfied and, if so, at what Level of Achievement, (ii) whether or not any Personal Goals established for any Participant for such Plan Year have been met, and (iii) the amount, if any, of the total Annual MIP Bonus payable for such Plan Year to each of the Participants (which shall be expressed as a percentage of such Participant’s Base Compensation for such Plan Year). The amount of any Annual MIP Bonus, as so certified by the Committee, shall be communicated in writing to each Participant and shall be payable to such Participant as provided in Section 3(e). 

^^ \centered (c) *Definition of Accounting Terms*. Unless otherwise so determined by the Committee and reflected in the terms of the potential Annual MIP Bonus established pursuant to Section 3(a), accounting terms used by the Committee in establishing the Performance Criteria, Levels of Achievement and Personal Goals shall be defined, and the results based thereon shall be measured, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied by the Company in preparing its consolidated financial statements and related financial disclosures for the Plan Year, as included in its reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

^^ \centered (d) *Employment Requirement for Annual MIP Bonus Payments and Exceptions Thereto*. In order to be eligible to receive an Annual Incentive Bonus under this MIP for any Plan Year, a Participant must be employed by the Company or a Subsidiary both (i) on the last day of such Plan Year, and (ii) except in the case of a termination of employment due to death, disability or a layoff (but not including either voluntary termination or termination for “cause” as determined by the Committee) after the last day of such Plan Year, on the date when the Annual MIP Bonus is paid. 

^^ \centered (e) *Time of Payment*. Except as provided in this Section 3(e), any Annual MIP Bonus to which a Participant becomes entitled under Section 3 with respect to a Plan Year shall be paid in a lump sum cash payment as soon as practicable after the amount thereof is determined by the Committee, but not later than the [[Date 2: Date]] immediately following completion of the Plan Year. 

^ \centered 4. Administration. 

The MIP shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall have the authority in its sole discretion, subject to and not inconsistent with the express provisions of the MIP, to administer the MIP and to exercise all the powers and authorities either specifically granted to it under the MIP or necessary or advisable in the administration of the MIP including, without limitation, to construe and interpret the MIP, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the MIP, and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the MIP.
