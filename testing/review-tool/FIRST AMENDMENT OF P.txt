^^^If the Shares are at the time listed or admitted to trading on any stock exchange, then the Fair Market Value shall be the closing price per Share on such date on the principal exchange on which the Shares are then listed or admitted to trading or, if no such sale is reported on that date, on the last preceding date on which a sale was so reported.

^^^If the Shares are not at the time listed or admitted to trading on a stock exchange, the Fair Market Value shall be the closing bid and asked price of the Shares on the date in question in the over-the-counter market, as such price is

^^^If the Shares are not listed or admitted to trading on any stock exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market, the Fair Market Value shall be as determined by the Committee in good faith.

For purposes of determining the Fair Market Value of Shares that are sold pursuant to a cashless exercise program, Fair Market Value shall be the price at which such Shares are sold.”
