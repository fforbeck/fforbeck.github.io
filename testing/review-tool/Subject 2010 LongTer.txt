Subject: 2010 Long-Term Incentive Equity Grants 

Dear _____:  
This letter is to inform you that Armstrong’s Management Development and Compensation Committee granted you the following long-term incentive equity grant effective [[Date 2: Date]]: 

^^^Stock Options

^^^Performance Restricted Shares 

This award provides meaningful incentive to strive for the aspirational targets which have been established and recognizes the importance of your impact toward achieving the company’s performance. The award is subject to the terms of the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan and this grant letter. 

Stock Options  
Each Stock Option entitles you to purchase one share of AWI common stock at an exercise price equal to $XXXX, the New York Stock Exchange closing price of AWI stock on [[Date 2]]. You may pay the option exercise in cash or by delivering shares of AWI stock you have owned for at least six months. 

The options are non-qualified and have a ten-year term starting [[Date 2]]. They will vest and become exercisable in three installments at one, two and three years as follows: XXXX shares on [[Date 3: Date]]; XXXX shares on [[Date 4: Date]]; and XXXX shares on [[Date 5: Date]]. 

Performance Restricted Shares  
The Committee has established the following performance schedule that allows participants to earn up to [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the performance restricted shares if the company achieves [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the 2010 corporate operating income goal. 

% of % of Operating    Performance Income Target    Restricted Achieved    Shares Earned less than [[Percentage 3: Number]]%        % [[Percentage 3]]%        **%** [[Percentage 4: Number]]%        % [[Percentage 5: Number]]%        % [[Percentage 6: Number]]%        % [[Percentage 7: Number]]%        % [[Percentage 8: Number]]%        % [[Percentage 9: Number]]%        % [[Percentage 10: Number]]%        % [[Percentage 11: Number]]%        % **[[Percentage 2]]%**        **%**  

^^^^^ 
The performance restricted shares have a 1-year performance period followed by a 2-year service vesting period for a total 3-year restriction period. Restrictions will lapse [[Date 6: Date]]. AWI common stock will be distributed to you following the conclusion of the restriction period. The company will use share tax withholding to satisfy your tax obligations unless you provide a payment to cover the taxes. 

Each Performance Restricted Share granted is credited to an account maintained for you. During the 3-year restriction period you have no ownership or voting rights relative to these shares. If Armstrong makes cash dividend payments during the restriction period, the value of the dividends will accrue in a non-interest bearing account. You will receive a cash payment for the accrued dividends at the end of the restriction period. The payment would be adjusted proportionate to the earned shares.
