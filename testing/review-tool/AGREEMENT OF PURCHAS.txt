To the extent assignable at no cost to Seller, all intangible personal property, if any, owned by Seller and related to the Real Property and the Improvements, including, without limitation: any trade names and trademarks associated with the Real Property and the Improvements (but specifically excluding the names “RREEF” and any derivatives thereof); any plans and specifications and other architectural and engineering drawings for the Improvements; any warranties and guaranties; any Service Contracts (as defined in Section 2.1(b) below) and other contract rights related to the Property (but only to the extent Seller’s obligations thereunder are expressly assumed by Buyer pursuant to the Assignment of Leases as defined in Section 8.3(a)(3) below); and any governmental permits, approvals and licenses (including any pending applications) (collectively, the **“Intangible Personal Property”**). 

^Purchase Price.

^^The Purchase Price shall be paid as follows: 

^Within two (2) business days after the Effective Date, Buyer shall deposit in escrow with Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, 4643 South Ulster, Suite No. 500, Denver, CO 80237 (the **“Title Company”**) cash or other immediately available funds in the amount of Three Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]) (the **“Initial Deposit”**).

The Initial Deposit and the Additional Deposit (if and when the Additional Deposit is deposited by Buyer with the Title Company as provided hereunder) are collectively referred to herein as the **“Deposit”**. 

The Deposit shall be held in an interest bearing account and all interest thereon, less investment fees, if any, shall be deemed a part of the Deposit. If the sale of the Property as contemplated hereunder is consummated, then the Deposit shall be paid to Seller at the Closing (as defined in Section 1.2(b)(3) below) and credited against the Purchase Price. **IF THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY IS NOT CONSUMMATED DUE TO SELLER’S DEFAULT HEREUNDER, THEN BUYER MAY ELECT, AS BUYER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, EITHER TO: (1) TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND RECEIVE A REFUND OF THE DEPOSIT, IN WHICH EVENT (1) ESCROW AGENT SHALL REFUND TO BUYER THE DEPOSIT,** 

**TOGETHER WITH ANY ACCRUED INTEREST THEREON, AND SELLER SHALL REIMBURSE BUYER, WITHIN SEVEN (7) DAYS AFTER SUCH TERMINATION, UP TO, BUT NOT IN EXCESS OF, THE SUM OF FIFTY THOUSAND AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($[[USD Value 3: Number]]) FOR THE ACTUAL, OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY BUYER WITH RESPECT TO THE NEGOTIATION OF, AND DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT PERFORMED BY THIRD PARTIES UNRELATED TO BUYER, WHICH COSTS AND EXPENSES ARE EVIDENCED BY WRITTEN INVOICES IN REASONABLE DETAIL, IN WHICH EVENT, AND, UPON RECEIPT BY BUYER OF THE AMOUNTS SET FORTH ABOVE, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY FURTHER RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 6.1, 9.3 AND 9.9 BELOW, OR (2) ENFORCE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT THAT BUYER ELECTS TO SEEK SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE UNDER (2) ABOVE, BUYER HEREBY AGREES THAT: (A) BUYER SHALL BRING SUCH ACTION WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THE SCHEDULED CLOSING DATE, OR ELSE SUCH REMEDY SHALL BE DEEMED WAIVED; AND (B) UNLESS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY REQUIRED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLER BE OBLIGATED TO UNDERTAKE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: (1) CHANGE THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY OR RESTORE THE SAME AFTER ANY FIRE OR CASUALTY; (2) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, EXPEND MONEY OR POST A BOND TO REMOVE OR INSURE OVER A TITLE DEFECT OR ENCUMBRANCE OR TO CORRECT ANY MATTER SHOWN ON A SURVEY OF THE PROPERTY; (3) SECURE ANY PERMIT, APPROVAL, OR CONSENT WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY OR SELLER’S CONVEYANCE THEREOF; OR (4) EXPEND ANY MONEY TO REPAIR, IMPROVE, REMEDIATE OR ALTER THE PROPERTY OR ANY PORTION THEREOF. IF BUYER SHALL NOT INSTITUTE AN ACTION FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THE SCHEDULED CLOSING DATE, TIME BEING OF THE ESSENCE, AND BUYER HAS NOT ELECTED TO WAIVE SUCH DEFAULT BY SELLER, BUYER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE ELECTED TO EXERCISE THE REMEDY SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH (1) ABOVE. BUYER SHALL NOT HAVE ANY OTHER RIGHTS OR REMEDIES HEREUNDER AS A RESULT OF ANY DEFAULT BY SELLER PRIOR TO CLOSING, AND BUYER HEREBY WAIVES ANY OTHER SUCH REMEDY AS A RESULT OF A DEFAULT HEREUNDER BY SELLER. IF THE SALE IS NOT CONSUMMATED DUE TO ANY DEFAULT BY BUYER HEREUNDER, THEN SELLER SHALL, AS SELLER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, RETAIN THE DEPOSIT AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT SELLER’S ACTUAL DAMAGES, IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE THIS SALE DUE TO BUYER’S** 

**DEFAULT PRIOR TO CLOSING, WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE. AFTER NEGOTIATION, THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT, CONSIDERING ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING ON THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE DAMAGES THAT SELLER WOULD INCUR IN SUCH EVENT. BY PLACING THEIR INITIALS BELOW, EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY CONFIRMS THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS MADE ABOVE AND THE FACT THAT EACH PARTY WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL WHO EXPLAINED, AT THE TIME THIS AGREEMENT WAS MADE, THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION. THE FOREGOING IS NOT INTENDED TO LIMIT EITHER PARTY’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTIONS 6.1, 9.3 AND 9.9.** 

^The balance of the Purchase Price (plus or minus the prorations pursuant to Section 8.5 hereof) shall be paid to Seller in cash or by wire transfer of other immediately available funds at the consummation of the purchase and sale contemplated hereunder (the **“Closing”**).

^No Liability for Exception Matters. 

As used herein, the term **“Exception Matter”** shall refer to a matter which would make a representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement untrue or incorrect and which is disclosed to Buyer in the Due Diligence Materials, the Disclosure Items, or otherwise, or is a matter of public record, or is otherwise known to Buyer’s Representatives (as hereinafter defined) before the Closing, including, without limitation, matters disclosed in any tenant estoppel certificate or from interviews with tenants, property managers or any other person. If Buyer first obtains knowledge of any material Exception Matter after the close of the Contingency Period and prior to Closing and such Exception Matter was not contained in the Due Diligence Materials, the Disclosure Items or is not a matter of public record, Buyer’s sole remedy shall be to terminate this Agreement on the basis thereof, upon written notice to Seller within the earlier of: (a) five (5) days following Buyer’s discovery of such Exception Matter; or (b) the Closing, which ever occurs first, in which event the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer, unless within five (5) days after receipt of such notice or by the Closing, as the case may be, Seller notifies Buyer in writing that it elects to attempt to cure or remedy such Exception Matter, in which event there shall be no return of the Deposit unless and until Seller is unable to so cure or remedy within the time period set forth below. Seller shall be entitled to extend the Closing Date (as defined in Section 8.2 below) for up to fifteen (15) business days in order to attempt to cure or remedy any Exception Matter. Buyer’s failure to give notice within five (5) days after it has obtained knowledge of a material Exception Matter shall be deemed a waiver by Buyer of such Exception Matter. Seller shall have no obligation to cure or remedy any Exception Matter, even if Seller has notified Buyer of Seller’s election to attempt to cure or remedy any Exception Matter (except as specifically provided in Section 4.1(c) hereof), and, subject to Buyer’s right to terminate this Agreement as set forth above, Seller shall have no liability whatsoever to Buyer with respect to any Exception Matters, unless the Exception Matter results from a breach or default under this Agreement, in which event, in addition to Buyer’s right to terminate this Agreement, Seller shall reimburse Buyer’s actual, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with this transaction as contemplated by Section 1.2(b) above, subject to the $[[USD Value 3]] cap set forth therein. Upon any termination of this 

Agreement, neither party shall have any further rights nor obligations hereunder, except as provided in Sections 6.1, 9.3 and 9.9 below. If Buyer or Buyer’s Representatives obtain knowledge of any Exception Matter before the Closing, but nonetheless elects to proceed with the acquisition of the Property, Seller shall have no liability with respect to such Exception Matter, notwithstanding any contrary provision, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any Other Documents (as defined in Section 9.19 below). The term “Buyer’s Representatives” shall mean collectively, David Fazekas, Tom McGonagle, Josh Widoff, Andrea Karp, Lainie Minnick, Matt Breaux and Emily Santangelo. For the purposes of this Agreement, whenever the phrase “to the best of Buyers’ knowledge” or the “knowledge of Buyer” or words of similar import are used, they shall be deemed to mean and are limited to the current actual knowledge of the Buyer’s Representatives and not any implied, imputed or constructive knowledge of such individuals. Such individuals shall have no personal liability in any manner whatsoever hereunder or otherwise related to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

^Survival of Seller’s Representations and Warranties of Sale. 

The representations and warranties of Seller contained herein or in any Seller estoppel delivered pursuant to Section 8.4 below or in any Other Documents shall survive for a period of nine (9) months after the Closing. Any claim which Buyer may have against Seller for a breach of any such representation or warranty, whether such breach is known or unknown, which is not specifically asserted by written notice to Seller within such nine (9) month period shall not be valid or effective, and Seller shall have no liability with respect thereto. 

^Seller’s Knowledge.

Furthermore, it is understood and agreed that such individual(s) shall have no personal liability in any manner whatsoever hereunder or otherwise related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (a) any environmental or other report with respect to the Property which is delivered by Seller to Buyer shall be for general informational purposes only, (b) Buyer shall not have any right to rely on any such report delivered by Seller to Buyer, but rather will rely on its own inspections and investigations of the Property and any reports commissioned by Buyer with respect thereto, (c) neither Seller, any affiliate of Seller nor the person or entity which prepared any such report delivered by Seller to Buyer shall have any liability to Buyer for any inaccuracy in or omission from any such report and (d) the failure to deliver any report as to the environmental or other condition of the Property, including any proposal for work at the Property which was not performed by Seller, shall not be actionable by Buyer under this Agreement or otherwise. 

^^EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 3.1 ABOVE AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS, BUYER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT SELLER IS SELLING AND BUYER IS PURCHASING THE PROPERTY ON AN “AS IS WITH ALL FAULTS” BASIS AND THAT BUYER IS NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, FROM SELLER, ANY SELLER RELATED PARTIES, OR THEIR AGENTS OR BROKERS, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ACTING OR PURPORTING TO ACT ON BEHALF OF SELLER, AS TO ANY MATTERS CONCERNING THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION: (i) the quality, nature, adequacy and physical condition and aspects of the Property, including, but not limited to, the structural elements, seismic aspects of the Property, foundation, roof, appurtenances, access, landscaping, parking facilities and the electrical, mechanical, HVAC, plumbing, sewage, and utility systems, facilities and appliances, the square footage within the improvements on the Real Property and within each tenant space therein, (ii) the quality, nature, adequacy, and physical condition of soils, geology and any groundwater, (iii) the existence, quality, nature, adequacy and physical condition of utilities serving the Property, (iv) the development potential of the Property, and the Property’s use, habitability, merchantability, or fitness, suitability, value or adequacy of the Property for any particular purpose, (v) the zoning or other legal status of the Property or any other public or private restrictions on use of the Property, (vi) the compliance of the Property or its operation with any applicable codes, laws, regulations, statutes, ordinances, covenants, conditions and restrictions of any governmental or quasi-governmental entity or of any other person or entity, (vii) the presence of Hazardous Materials on, under or about the Property or the adjoining or neighboring property, (viii) the quality of any labor and materials used in any improvements on the Real Property, (ix) the condition of title to the Property, (x) the Lease, Service Contracts, or other documents or agreements affecting the Property, or any information contained in any rent roll furnished to Buyer for the Property, (xi) the value, economics of the operation or income potential of the Property, or (x) any other fact or condition which may affect the Property, including without limitation, the physical condition, value, economics of operation or income potential of the Property. In addition, Seller shall have no legal obligation to apprise Buyer regarding any event or other matter involving the Property which occurs after the Effective Date or to otherwise update the Due Diligence Materials, unless and until an event or other matter occurs which would cause Seller to be unable to remake any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement. 

^Release. 

^^Without limiting the above, and subject to the representations and warranties of Seller contained in Sections 3.1 and 6.1 hereof and in any Other Documents, Buyer on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns waives its right to recover from, and forever releases and discharges, Seller, Seller’s affiliates, Seller’s investment advisor, the partners, trustees, beneficiaries, shareholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees and agents and representatives of each of them, and their respective heirs, successors, personal representatives and assigns (collectively, the **“Seller Related Parties”**), from any and all demands, claims, legal or administrative proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, penalties, fines, liens, judgments, costs or expenses whatsoever (including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys’ fees and disbursements), whether direct or indirect, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, that may arise on account of or in any way be connected with (i) the physical condition of the Property including, without limitation, all structural and seismic elements, all mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and other systems, the environmental condition of the Property and the presence of Hazardous Materials on, under or about the Property, or (ii) any law or regulation applicable to the Property, including, without limitation, any Environmental Law and any other federal, state or local law provided, however that in the event any claim is asserted by any third party (not affiliated with Buyer), against Buyer after Closing arising from or in connection with any releases or discharges of Hazardous Materials onto the Real Property during Seller’s period of ownership of the Property, Buyer shall not be deemed to have released Seller from any contribution liability arising from or related to matters giving rise to such third party claim. 

^Survival. 

The provisions of this Article III shall survive the Closing subject to the limitations and qualifications contained in such provisions and in Sections 9.11 and 9.19 hereof. 

\centered **TITLE** 

^Conditions of Title. 

^^Buyer has ordered an updated title commitment (the **“Title Report”**) from the Title Company, which shall be delivered to Seller, together with copies of all underlying documents relating to title exceptions referred to therein, promptly upon Buyer’s receipt thereof. Seller has furnished to Buyer the existing survey of the Property. Buyer shall immediately order any plat or survey of the Property or any update thereto from a duly licensed surveyor (the **“Survey”**) if desired by Buyer or if necessary to support the issuance of the Title Policy (as defined in Section 4.2 below). Buyer shall provide to Seller a copy of the Survey, which shall be certified to the Title Company, Buyer and Seller. Buyer shall pay the entire cost of the Survey. If Closing does not occur, Buyer shall, if Seller so requests, assign to Seller all contract rights Buyer has with the surveyor, to the extent assignable, and in such event Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the cost of the Survey. 

^^No later than the last day of the Contingency Period (the **“Title Review Date”**), Buyer shall furnish Seller with a written statement of objections, if any, to the title to the Property, including, without limitation, any objections to any matter shown on the Survey (collectively, **“Objections”**). In the event the Title Company amends or updates the Title Report after the Title Review Date (each, a **“Title Report Update”**), Buyer shall furnish Seller with a written statement of Objections to any matter first raised in a Title Report Update within three (3) business days after its receipt of such Title Report Update (each, a **“Title Update Review Period”**). Should Buyer fail to notify Seller in writing of any Objections in the Title Report prior to the Title Review Date, or to any matter first disclosed in a Title Report Update prior to the Title Update Review Period, as applicable, Buyer shall be deemed to have approved such matters which shall be considered to be **“Conditions of Title”** as defined in Section 4.1(e) below. 

^^If Seller receives a timely Objection in accordance with Section 4.1(b) (**“Buyer’s Notice”**), Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, within five (5) business days after receipt of Buyer’s Notice (**“Seller’s Response Period”**), to elect to attempt to cure any such matter upon written notice to Buyer (**“Seller’s Response”**), and may extend the Closing Date for up to fifteen (15) business days to allow such cure. Seller’s Response shall indicate if Seller intends to cause the Title Company to insure over such Objection, and Buyer shall have the right to object to such method of cure in the same manner as Objections to matters raised in a Title Report Update. If Seller does not give any Seller’s Response, Seller shall be deemed to have elected not to attempt to cure any such matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall in any event be obligated to cure all matters or items (i) that are mortgage or deed of trust liens or security interests against the Property, in each case granted by Seller (and not tenants of the Property or other third parties), (ii) real estate tax liens, other than liens for taxes and assessments not yet delinquent, and (iii) that have been voluntarily placed against the Property by Seller (and not tenants of the Property or other third parties) after the date of this Agreement and that are not otherwise permitted pursuant to the provisions hereof. Seller shall be entitled to apply the Purchase Price towards the payment or satisfaction of such liens, and may cure any Objection by causing the Title Company to insure against collection of the same out of the Property. 

^^If Seller elects (or is deemed to have elected) not to attempt to cure any Objections raised in any Buyer’s Notice timely delivered by Buyer to Seller pursuant to Section 4.1(b), or if Seller notifies Buyer that it elects to attempt to cure any such Objection but then does not for any reason effect such cure on or before the Closing Date as it may be extended hereunder, then Buyer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, shall have the option of terminating this Agreement by delivering written notice thereof to Seller within three (3) business days after (as applicable) (i) its receipt of Seller’s Response stating that Seller will not attempt to cure any such Objection or (ii) the expiration of Seller’s Response Period if Seller does not deliver a Seller’s Response or (iii) Seller’s failure to cure by the Closing Date (as it may be extended hereunder) any Objection which Seller has previously elected to attempt to cure pursuant to a Seller’s Response. In the event of such a termination, the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer, and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder except as provided in Sections 6.1, 9.3 and 9.9 below. If no such termination notice is timely received by Seller hereunder, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived all such Objections in which event those Objections shall become **“Conditions of Title”** under Section 4.1(e). If the Closing is not consummated for any reason other than Seller’s default hereunder, Buyer shall be responsible for any title or escrow cancellation charges. 

^^At the Closing, Seller shall convey title to the Property to Buyer by deed in the form of **Exhibit C** attached hereto (the **“Deed”**) subject to the title matters set forth therein and the Conditions of Title. The term “Conditions to Title” shall mean: 

^^^Interests of the tenant in possession under the Lease; 

^^^Matters created by, or with the written consent of, Buyer; 

^^^Real estate taxes and assessments not yet due and payable for the year of Closing; 

^^^Any exceptions disclosed by the Title Report and any Title Report Update which is approved or deemed approved by Buyer in accordance with this Article IV above; and 

^^^The Declaration of Access, Utility and Drainage Easement and Maintenance Agreement in the form negotiated and approved by Seller and Buyer during the Contingency Period. 

Nothing contained in this subsection (e) shall negate Buyer’s ability to object to any matter first raised in a Title Report Update. Subject to the terms and conditions contained elsewhere in this Agreement, by acceptance of the Deed and the Closing of the purchase and sale of the Property, (x) Buyer agrees it is assuming for the benefit of Seller all of the obligations of Seller with respect to the Conditions of Title from and after the Closing, and (y) Buyer agrees that Seller shall have conclusively satisfied its obligations with respect to title to the Property. The provisions of this Section shall survive the Closing. 

^Evidence of Title. 

Delivery of title in accordance with the foregoing shall be evidenced by the willingness of the Title Company to issue, at Closing, its Owner’s ALTA Policy of Title Insurance in the amount of the Purchase Price showing title to the Real Property vested in Buyer, subject to the Conditions of Title (the **“Title Policy”**) and shall be a condition to Buyer’s obligation to close hereunder. The Title Policy may contain such endorsements as reasonably required by Buyer provided that the issuance of such endorsements shall not be a condition to Buyer’s obligations hereunder. Buyer shall pay the costs for the Title Policy and all such endorsements. Seller shall have no obligation to provide any indemnity or agreement to the Title Company or Buyer to support the issuance of the Title Policy or any such endorsements other than an affidavit as to the existing tenant of the Property and any ongoing construction work at the Property. 

\centered **RISK OF LOSS AND INSURANCE PROCEEDS** 

^Minor Loss. 

Buyer shall be bound to purchase the Property for the full Purchase Price as required by the terms hereof, without regard to the occurrence or effect of any damage to the Property or destruction of any improvements thereon or condemnation of any portion of the Property, provided that: (a) the cost to repair any such damage or destruction does not exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 4: Number]]) in the estimate of an architect or contractor selected by Seller and reasonably acceptable to Buyer or in the case of a condemnation, the diminution in the value of the remaining Property as a result of a partial condemnation is not material (as hereinafter defined) and (b) upon the Closing, there shall be a credit against the Purchase Price due hereunder equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards collected by Seller as a result of any such damage or destruction or condemnation, plus the amount of any insurance deductible, less any sums expended by Seller toward the collection of such proceeds or awards and the restoration or repair of the Property (the nature of which restoration or repairs, but not the right of Seller to effect such restoration or repairs, shall be subject to the approval of Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the proceeds or awards have not been collected as of the Closing, then such proceeds or awards shall be assigned to Buyer, except to the extent needed to reimburse Seller for sums expended to collect such proceeds or awards or to repair or restore the Property, and Seller shall retain the rights to such proceeds and awards to such extent. 

^Major Loss. 

If the cost to repair the damage or destruction as specified above exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 4]]) in the estimate of an architect or contractor selected by Seller and reasonably acceptable to Buyer or the diminution in the value of the remaining Property as a result of a condemnation is material (as hereinafter defined), then Buyer may, at its option to be exercised within five (5) days of Seller’s notice of the occurrence of the damage or destruction or the commencement of condemnation proceedings, either terminate this Agreement or consummate the purchase for the full Purchase Price as required by the terms hereof. If Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice thereof to Seller or fails to give Seller notice within such five (5) day period that Buyer will proceed with the purchase, then this Agreement shall terminate, the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder except as provided in Sections 6.1, 9.3 and 9.9 below. If Buyer elects to proceed with the purchase, then upon the Closing, there shall be a credit against the Purchase Price due hereunder equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards collected by Seller as a result of any such damage or destruction or condemnation, plus the amount of any insurance deductible, less any sums expended by Seller toward the collection of such proceeds or awards or to restoration or repair of the Property (the nature of which restoration or repairs, but not the right of Seller to effect such restoration or repairs, shall be subject to the approval of Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the proceeds or awards have not been collected as of the Closing, then such proceeds or awards shall be assigned to Buyer, except to the extent needed to reimburse Seller for sums expended to collect such proceeds or awards or to repair or restore the Property, and Seller shall retain the rights to such proceeds and awards to such extent. A condemnation shall be deemed material if any portion of any net rentable area of the Property, or any parking is taken which would cause the Property to be in violation of any existing laws or regulations, including but not limited to, zoning regulations, or the existing access to the Property is materially and adversely affected, permanently. 

^Tenant Lease Termination. 

If the tenant under the Lease terminates the Lease as a result of a casualty or condemnation occurring prior to Closing, then Seller and Buyer shall each have the right to terminate this Agreement by notice given to the other within two (2) days after the occurrence of such casualty or condemnation. 

\centered **BROKERS AND EXPENSES** 

^Brokers. 

The parties represent and warrant to each other that no broker or finder was instrumental in arranging or bringing about this transaction except for Cassidy Turley (**“Seller’s Broker”**). At Closing, Seller shall pay the commission due, if any, to Seller’s Broker, which shall be paid pursuant to a separate agreement between Seller and Seller’s Broker. If any other person brings a claim for a commission or finder’s fee based upon any contact, dealings or communication with Buyer or Seller, then the party through whom such person makes its claim shall defend the other party (the **“Indemnified Party”**) from such claim, and shall indemnify the Indemnified Party and hold the Indemnified Party harmless from any and all costs, damages, claims, liabilities or expenses (including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending against the claim. The provisions of this Section 6.1 shall survive the Closing or, if the purchase and sale is not consummated, any termination of this Agreement. 

^Expenses. 

Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, each party hereto shall pay its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

\centered **LEASES AND OTHER AGREEMENTS** 

^Buyer’s Approval of New Leases and Agreements Affecting the Property. 

Seller shall not enter into any new Lease or other agreement affecting the Property, or modify or terminate any existing Lease or other agreement affecting the Property, which will be binding on the Property after Closing, except as required under the Lease and except for service agreements which are terminable on no more than thirty (30) days’ notice without payment of any penalty or fee or other cost, without first obtaining Buyer’s approval of the proposed action, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In such case, Buyer shall specify in detail the reasons for its disapproval of any such proposed action. If Buyer fails to give 

Seller notice of its approval or disapproval of any such proposed action requiring its approval under this Section 7.1 within three (3) business days after Seller notifies Buyer of Seller’s desire to take such action, then Buyer shall be deemed to have given its approval. Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller in enabling Seller to complete any such proposed transaction requiring Buyer’s approval. 

^Intentionally Omitted. 

^Tenant Notices. 

At the Closing, Seller shall furnish Buyer with a signed notice to be given to the tenant of the Property. The notice shall disclose that the Property has been sold to Buyer, that, after the Closing, all rents should be paid to Buyer and that Buyer shall be responsible for all the tenant’s security deposit. The form of the notice shall be otherwise reasonably acceptable to the parties. Buyer covenants to deliver said notices to such tenant as soon as reasonably possible after Closing. This provision shall expressly survive Closing. 

^Maintenance of Improvements and Operation of Property; Removal of Tangible Personal Property. 

Seller agrees to keep its customary property insurance covering the Property in effect until the Closing (provided, however, that the terms of any such coverage maintained in blanket form may be modified as Seller deems necessary). Seller shall maintain all Improvements substantially in their present condition (ordinary wear and tear, casualty and condemnation excepted), and shall operate and manage the Property in a manner consistent with Seller’s practices in effect prior to the Effective Date, provided that Seller shall in no event be obligated to make any capital expenditures or repairs other than roof repairs required by the Lease. Seller shall not remove any Tangible Personal Property, except as may be required for necessary repair or replacement, and replacement shall be of approximately equal quality and quantity as the removed item of Tangible Personal Property. 

^Service Contracts. 

Within three (3) business days prior to the expiration of the Contingency Period, Buyer will advise Seller in writing which Service Contracts Buyer will assume and which Service Contracts Buyer requests be terminated at Closing, provided Seller shall have no obligation to terminate, and Buyer shall be obligated to assume, any Service Contracts which by their terms cannot be terminated without penalty or payment of a fee or other cost to Seller. Seller shall deliver at Closing notices of termination of all Service Contracts that are not so assumed and Buyer shall be responsible for any charges applicable to periods commencing with the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall terminate, as of the Closing Date, all existing management and leasing agreements with respect to the Property. 

\centered **CLOSING AND ESCROW** 

^Escrow Instructions. 

The escrow instructions to Title Company will be in the form of **Exhibit H** attached hereto (the **“Escrow Instructions”**), which shall be executed by Seller and Buyer simultaneously with this Agreement, for delivery to Title Company.

Seller shall prepare a draft closing statement and deliver a copy thereof to Buyer at least three (3) business days prior to Closing. Seller and Buyer hereby designate Title Company as the **“Reporting Person”** for the transaction pursuant to Section 6045(e) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and agree to execute such documentation as is reasonably necessary to effectuate such designation. 

^^Within five (5) business days after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver or make available at the Property to Buyer: originals of the Lease to the extent in Seller’s possession, or copies of such Lease if not in Seller’s possession together with an affidavit from Seller as to such copies being true and complete copies of the Lease, copies of the tenant correspondence files (for the three (3) most recent years of Seller’s ownership of the Property only and the current year), and originals of any other items which Seller was required to furnish Buyer copies of or make available at the Property pursuant to Sections 2.1(b) or (e) above, to the extent in Seller’s possession, except for Seller’s general ledger and other internal books or records which shall be retained by Seller. Seller shall deliver possession of the Property to Buyer as required hereunder and shall deliver to Buyer or make available at the Property a set of keys to the Property on the Closing Date. The provisions of this Section 8.3(d) shall survive Closing. 

^^For a period of seventy-five (75) days after the Closing, at the request of Buyer and at Buyer’s expense, Seller shall make available to Buyer the historical financial information in Seller’s possession regarding the operation of the Property to the extent required by Buyer (as a publicly-traded real estate investment trust) in order to prepare stand-alone audited financial statements for such operations and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as of the end of the fiscal year 2009 and any required subsequent date or period, and to cooperate (at Buyer’s expense) with Buyer and any auditor engaged by Buyer for such purpose. Seller shall cause its property manager, without liability, recourse or cost to Seller, to provide to Buyer’s designated independent auditor letter regarding the books and records of the Property in substantially the form of Exhibit I attached hereto and made a part hereof (the “**Audit Inquiry Letter**”). Buyer agrees that (a) Buyer shall be solely liable to pay and shall reimburse Seller, within five (5) business days following Seller’s request, for all third-party, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller in assisting Buyer at Buyer’s request under this Section (such assistance, the “**Audit Assistance**”), including all such costs incurred to review, research and complete the Audit Inquiry Letter; (b) Seller’s performance of any Audit Assistance shall be solely as an accommodation to Buyer and Seller shall have no, and Seller is hereby fully released and discharged from, any and all liability or obligation with respect to the Audit Assistance, any filings (the “**SEC Filings**”) made by Buyer or its parent with the United States Securities and Exchange 

Commission (“**SEC**”) and the Audit Inquiry Letter; and (c) Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, protect, defend and hold Seller, its partners and their respective members, officers, directors, shareholders, participants, affiliates, employees, representatives, investors, agents, successors and assigns (each an “**Indemnified Party**” and collectively, the “**Indemnified Parties**”) harmless from and against any and all costs, expenses, losses, liabilities, damages, claims, demands, allegations or actions (collectively, “**Losses**”) actually asserted against or actually incurred by any Indemnified Party as a result of or otherwise arising in connection with the Audit Assistance, the SEC Filings and/or the Audit Inquiry Letter; provided, that Losses shall specifically exclude any Losses proximately resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of an Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section 8.3(e) shall survive Closing. 

^Estoppel Certificates. 

^^If, in accordance with Article II of this Agreement, Buyer elects to proceed with the purchase of the Property, then Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an estoppel certificate from the tenant of the Property, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F; provided, however, if such tenant refuses to execute such form, but otherwise executes a form in accordance with the terms of the Lease, such estoppel received from the tenant shall take precedence over the form of tenant estoppel certificate attached as Exhibit F. It shall be a condition to Buyer’s obligation to close the sale and purchase of the Property that on or before the Closing, Buyer is able to obtain an estoppel certificate. The estoppel certificate shall be dated no more than forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date. An estoppel certificate will be deemed reasonably acceptable to Buyer if it addresses the matters contained in the Tenant Estoppel Certificate dated [[Date 5: Date]] previously provided by the tenant under the Lease, as same may be updated to reflect the current status of the terms of the Lease, however, in lieu of paragraph 6 in said Tenant Estoppel Certificate, the tenant shall confirm either that the right of first offer is not applicable to Buyer’s acquisition of the Property or the tenant has waived its right of first offer with respect to this transaction or permanently. 

^^If Seller is unable to obtain and deliver the tenant estoppel certificate as required under Section 8.4(a), or if the certificate received contains material information or omissions unacceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion and Buyer objects thereto by written notice to Seller within two (2) business days after receipt by Buyer of the objectionable estoppel, but in any event on or before the Closing Date, then Seller will not be in default by reason thereof, and Seller may elect to extend the Closing Date by up to thirty (30) days in order to satisfy the requirement. If Seller still cannot satisfy the requirement at the end of such extended period, then Buyer may, by written notice given to Seller before the Closing, elect to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of the Deposit or waive said condition. If Buyer so elects to terminate this Agreement, neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder except as provided in Section 6.1 above and Sections 9.3 and 9.9 below. If no such notice is delivered by Buyer, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived such condition. 

^Prorations. 

^^Rents, and any additional charges and expenses payable by the tenant under the Lease, all as and when actually collected; real property taxes and assessments; water, sewer and utility charges; amounts payable under any Service Contracts or other agreements or documents; annual permits and/or inspection fees (calculated on the basis of the period covered); and any other expenses of the operation and maintenance of the Property (including, without limitation, expenses prepaid by Seller and expenses already paid by Seller but which are being amortized over time by Seller and with respect to which Seller shall receive a credit at Closing in the amount of the prepaid or unamortized portion thereof), shall all be prorated as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately prior to Closing (i.e., Buyer is entitled to the income and responsible for the expenses of the day of Closing), on the basis of a 365-day year. 

Delinquent rentals under the Lease shall not be prorated. All rents collected after the Closing shall be applied and paid as provided in this Section 8.5(a). If at Closing the tenant is in arrears with respect to the payment of rent or any other payment due from the tenant pursuant to the Lease, any payment received from such tenant after Closing shall be deemed a payment of rent due after the Closing until the tenant is current on rents and sums due under the Lease on or after the Closing, and then such payments shall be paid to Seller to the extent of any rent or other sums owing to Seller for periods prior to Closing. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to collect such rents and other sums owing to Seller during the period between the Closing Date and the date that is ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, but shall not be required to bring any action against the tenant or exercise remedies under the Lease. Seller retains the right to collect any such rents and other sums from the tenant after Closing (including legal action seeking monetary damages); provided, however, that Seller shall have no right to cause any such tenant to be evicted or to exercise any other landlord remedy against such tenant other than to sue for collection. 

Reconciliations of taxes, insurance charges and other expenses owed by the tenant under the Lease for the calendar year (or fiscal year if different from the calendar year) in which the Closing occurs shall be prepared by Buyer with the cooperation of Seller within sixty (60) days following the end of such year in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Lease and as provided in this Section 8.5(a). The proration between the parties of income received from the tenant from reconciliations of expenses under the Lease shall be calculated based on the expenses actually incurred by each party for such year and each party’s period of ownership of the Property, and otherwise in accordance with this Section 8.5(a). 

The amount of any cash security deposits (together with accrued interest, if any, thereon) held by Seller under the Lease shall be credited against the Purchase Price (and Seller shall be entitled to retain such cash security deposits). Seller shall receive credits at Closing for the amount of any utility or other deposits with respect to the Property. Buyer shall cause all utilities to be transferred into Buyer’s name and account at the time of Closing. 

Seller and Buyer hereby agree that if any of the aforesaid prorations and credits cannot be calculated accurately on the Closing Date or in the case of rents or other charges received from the tenant, such amount have not been collected, then the same shall be calculated as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date or the date such amounts have been collected, and either party owing the other party a sum of money based on such subsequent proration(s) or credits shall pay said sum to the other party within thirty (30) days thereafter. Any amounts not paid within such thirty (30) day period shall bear interest from the date actually received by the payor until paid at the greater of (i) the rate of ten percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) per annum or (ii) the prime rate (or base rate) reported from time to time in the “Money Rates” column or section of The Wall Street Journal as being the base rate on corporate loans at larger United States money center commercial banks plus two (2) percent. Upon request of either party, the parties shall provide a detailed and accurate written statement signed by such party certifying as to the payments received by such party from tenants from and after Closing and to the manner in which such payments were applied, and shall make their books and records available for inspection by the other party during ordinary business hours upon reasonable advance notice. 

^^All title charges (including endorsements and reinsurance charges), survey costs, recording fees imposed upon the transfer of the Property by applicable law shall be paid by Buyer at Closing. Any sale and transfer taxes and escrow fees shall be split equally between Seller and Buyer. The parties will execute and deliver any required transfer or other similar tax declarations to the appropriate governmental entity at Closing. 

^^The provisions of this Section 8.5 shall survive the Closing. 

^Conditions Precedent to Closing. 

^^Seller shall not be obligated to close under this Agreement unless each of the following conditions shall be satisfied or waived by Seller prior to the Closing Date:

^Entry and Indemnity. 

In connection with any entry by Buyer, or its agents, employees or contractors onto the Property, Buyer shall give Seller reasonable advance notice of such entry and shall conduct such entry and any inspections in connection therewith (a) during normal business hours, (b) so as to minimize, to the greatest extent possible, interference with Seller’s business and the business of Seller’s tenant, (c) in compliance with all applicable laws, and (d) otherwise in a manner reasonably acceptable to Seller. Without limiting the foregoing, prior to any entry to perform any on-site invasive testing, including but not limited to any borings, drillings or samplings, Buyer shall give Seller written notice thereof, including the identity of the company or persons who will perform such testing and the proposed scope and methodology of the testing. Seller shall approve or disapprove, in Seller’s sole discretion, the proposed testing within three (3) business days after receipt of such notice.

Upon the request of Seller, Buyer shall promptly deliver to Seller copies of any reports relating to any testing or other inspection of the Property performed by Buyer or its agents, representatives, employees, contractors or consultants. Buyer may make inquiry with any governmental authority as to information such governmental authority may have with respect to the zoning, development and land use approvals related to the Property; provided, however, Buyer may not disclose to any governmental authority any information about the Property that Buyer may obtain in the course of its due diligence activities without first obtaining the prior written consent of Seller thereto in Seller’s sole discretion except to the extent disclosure of such information is explicitly required to be made by Buyer pursuant to applicable laws.

Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any costs, damages, liabilities, losses, expenses, liens or claims (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) arising out of or relating to any entry on the Property by Buyer, its agents, employees or contractors in the course of performing the inspections, testings or inquiries provided for in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any release of Hazardous Materials or any damage to the Property and for enforcing this indemnity; provided that Buyer shall not be liable to Seller solely as a result of the mere discovery by Buyer of a pre-existing condition on the Property to the extent the activities of Buyer, its agents, representatives, employees, contractors or consultants do not exacerbate the condition. The provisions of this Section 9.3 shall supersede any access or indemnity agreement previously executed by Buyer in connection with the Property.

Buyer’s right of entry, as provided in this Section 9.3, shall continue up through the date of Closing.
