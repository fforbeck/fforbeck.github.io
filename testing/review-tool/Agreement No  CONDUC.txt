If any channels break out in the process of registering, the work may be continued if in an active arrangement the number of defect channels do not exceed 1 for 80 active channels. However, such defect channels should be disposed at the earliest opportunity.

The representative of the Company should appreciate the signal-noise relation at the site and may decrease requirements.

**6.2.3 Defective routs.**

To comply with such requirement the group base may be decreased up to dotted grouping.

**6.2.7. Noises**  
The station shall be positioned as far as possible from seismic profile to minimize noise.

Maximal permissible level of random noises shall not exceed stated level agreed above. The operators shall notify the representative of the Company about exceeding of the noise level.

Presence of permanent and inremovable ambient level, for example from power lines, drilling works, water flows, etc. shall not be a cause of rejecting of SP, if all other requirements are met. Decision on registration or skip of such SP shall be taken with permission of the representative of the Company.
