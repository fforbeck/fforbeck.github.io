any and all rights of Mortgagor, as a declarant, under any covenants, conditions, and restrictions now or hereafter pertaining to the real property described on Exhibit A hereto, provided, however, that Mortgagee shall have no liability under such covenants, conditions, and restrictions unless and until Mortgagee forecloses on the real property; all buildings, other improvements and fixtures now or hereafter located on the real property, including, but not limited to, all apparatus, equipment, and appliances used in the operation or occupancy of the real property, it being intended by the parties that all such items shall be conclusively considered to be a part of the real property, whether or not attached or affixed to the real property (the “Improvements”); all interest or estate which Mortgagor may hereafter acquire in the property described above, and all additions and accretions thereto, and the proceeds of any of the foregoing; (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as the “Subject Property”). The listing of specific rights or property shall not be interpreted as a limit of general terms.

^^**ADDRESS**. The address of the Subject Property is: 120 Mountain View Boulevard, Township of Bernards, New Jersey 07920. However, neither the failure to designate an address nor any inaccuracy in the address designated shall affect the validity or priority of the lien of this Mortgage on the Subject Property as described on Exhibit A.

^^**OBLIGATIONS SECURED**. Mortgagor makes this Mortgage for the purpose of securing the following obligations (“Secured Obligations”):

^^Payment to Mortgagee of all sums at any time owing under that certain Secured Promissory Note (as the same may be amended, restated or replaced from time to time, the “Note”) of even date herewith, in the principal amount of One Hundred Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]) executed by Mortgagor and certain other parties, as borrowers (“Borrowers”), and payable to the order of Mortgagee, as lender; and

^^Payment and performance of all covenants and obligations of Mortgagor under this Mortgage; and

^^Payment and performance of all covenants and obligations on the part of Borrower under that certain Loan Agreement (“Loan Agreement”) of even date herewith by and between Borrowers, Mortgagee, and Lenders (as defined in the Loan Agreement), the Hazardous Materials Indemnity Agreement, and all other “Loan Documents” as defined in the Loan Agreement ; and

^^Payment and performance of all covenants and obligations, if any, of any rider attached as an Exhibit to this Mortgage; and

^^Payment and performance of all future advances and other obligations that the then record owner of all or part of the Subject Property may agree to pay and/or perform (whether as principal, surety or guarantor) for the benefit of Mortgagee, when such future advance or obligation is evidenced by a writing which recites that it is secured by this Mortgage; and Mortgagor hereby acknowledges and agrees that this Mortgage is given to secure advances that may be made by Mortgagee and obligations that may be incurred by Mortgagor in addition and subsequent to the advances evidenced by the Note; and

^^Payment and performance of all covenants and obligations of Mortgagor under any interest rate swap agreement, or other interest rate hedge agreement of any type executed by and between Mortgagor and Mortgagee, which agreement is evidenced by a writing which recites that it is secured by this Mortgage; and

Loan No. 1002012 

^^All modifications, extensions and renewals of any of the obligations secured hereby, however evidenced, including, without limitation: (i) modifications of the required principal payment dates or interest payment dates or both, as the case may be, deferring or accelerating payment dates wholly or partly; or (ii) modifications, extensions or renewals at a different rate of interest whether or not in the case of a note, the modification, extension or renewal is evidenced by a new or additional promissory note or notes.

^^**OBLIGATIONS**. The term “obligations” is used herein in its broadest and most comprehensive sense and shall be deemed to include, without limitation, all interest and charges, prepayment charges (if any), late charges and loan fees at any time accruing or assessed on any of the Secured Obligations.

^^**INCORPORATION**. All capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Loan Agreement. All terms of the Secured Obligations and the documents evidencing such obligations are incorporated herein by this reference. All persons who may have or acquire an interest in the Subject Property shall be deemed to have notice of the terms of the Secured Obligations and to have notice, if provided therein, that: (a) the Note or the Loan Agreement may permit borrowing, repayment and re-borrowing so that repayments shall not reduce the amounts of the Secured Obligations; and (b) the rate of interest on one or more Secured Obligations may vary from time to time.

^^**ASSIGNMENT**. Mortgagor absolutely and irrevocably assigns to Mortgagee all of Mortgagor’s right, title and interest in, to and under: (a) all leases of the Subject Property or any portion thereof, and all other agreements of any kind relating to the use or occupancy of the Subject Property or any portion thereof, whether now existing or entered into after the date hereof (“Leases”); (b) the rents, revenue, income, issues, deposits and profits of the Subject Property, including, without limitation, all parking income and all amounts payable and all rights and benefits accruing to Mortgagor under the Leases (“Payments”); and (iii) all rights and claims for damage against tenants arising out of defaults under the Leases, including rights to termination fees and compensation with respect to rejected Leases pursuant to Section 365(a) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any replacement Section thereof. The term “Leases” shall also include all guarantees of and security for the lessees’ performance thereunder, and all amendments, extensions, renewals or modifications thereto which are permitted hereunder. This is a present and absolute assignment, not an assignment for security purposes, and Mortgagee’s right to the Leases and Payments is not contingent upon, and may be exercised without possession of, the Subject Property.

^^**GRANT OF LICENSE**. Mortgagee confers upon Mortgagor a license (“License”) to collect and retain the Payments as they become due and payable, until the occurrence of a Default (as hereinafter defined). Upon a Default, the License shall be automatically revoked and Mortgagee may collect and apply the Payments pursuant to Section 6.4 without notice and without taking possession of the Subject Property. Mortgagor hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the lessees under the Leases to rely upon and comply with any notice or demand by Mortgagee for the payment to Mortgagee of any rental or other sums which may at any time become due under the Leases, or for the performance of any of the lessees’ undertakings under the Leases, and the lessees shall have no right or duty to inquire as to whether any Default has actually occurred or is then existing hereunder. Mortgagor hereby relieves the lessees from any liability to Mortgagor by reason of relying upon and complying with any such notice or demand by Mortgagee.

^^**EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT**.

Mortgagee shall not directly or indirectly be liable to Mortgagor or any other person as a consequence of: (i) the exercise or failure to exercise by Mortgagee, or any of their respective employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors, any of the rights, remedies or powers granted to Mortgagee hereunder; or (ii) the failure or refusal of Mortgagee to perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability of Mortgagor arising under the Leases.

^^**REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**. Mortgagor represents and warrants that, to the best of Mortgagor’s knowledge: (a) Mortgagor has delivered to Mortgagee a rent roll that, as of the date hereof, contains a true, accurate and complete list of all Leases; (b) all existing Leases are in full force and effect and are enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, and no breach or default, or event which would constitute a breach or default after notice or the passage of time, or both, exists under any existing Leases on the part of any party; (c) no rent or other payment under any existing Lease has been paid by any lessee for more than one (1) month in advance; and (d) none of the lessor’s interests under any of the Leases has been transferred or assigned.

Mortgagor shall not, without Mortgagee’s prior written consent or as otherwise permitted by any provision of the Loan Agreement: (i) to the extent prohibited by the terms of the Loan Agreement, enter into any Leases after the date hereof; (ii) execute any other assignment relating to any of the Leases; (iii) to the extent prohibited by the terms of the Loan Agreement, discount any rent or other sums due under the Leases or collect the same in advance, other than to collect rentals one (1) month in advance of the time when it becomes due; (iv) to the extent prohibited by the terms of the Loan Agreement, terminate, modify or amend any of the terms of the Leases or in any manner release or discharge the lessees from any obligations thereunder; (v) to the extent prohibited by the terms of the Loan Agreement, consent to any assignment or subletting by any lessee; or (vi) subordinate or agree to subordinate any of the Leases to any other mortgage or encumbrance. Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this Section 3.5 shall be null and void. Without in any way limiting the requirement of Mortgagee’s consent hereunder, any sums received by Mortgagor in consideration of any termination (or the release or discharge of any lessee) modification or amendment of any Lease shall be applied as set forth in the Loan Agreement.

^^**REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**. Mortgagor represents and warrants that: (a) Mortgagor has, as of the date of recordation of this Mortgage, and will have, good title to the Collateral; (b) Mortgagor has not previously assigned or encumbered the Collateral, and no financing statement covering any of the Collateral has been delivered to any other person or entity; (c) Mortgagor’s principal place of business is located at the address shown in Section 7.11; and (d) Mortgagor’s legal name is exactly as set forth on the first page of this Mortgage and all of Mortgagor’s organizational documents or agreements delivered to Mortgagee are complete and accurate in every respect.

In addition to Mortgagee’s rights as a “Secured Party” under the UCC, Mortgagee may, but shall not be obligated to, at any time without notice and at the expense of Mortgagor: (a) give notice to any person of Mortgagee’s rights hereunder and enforce such rights at law or in equity; (b) insure, protect, defend and preserve the Collateral or any rights or interests of Mortgagee therein; (c) inspect the Collateral; and (d) endorse, collect and receive any right to payment of money owing to Mortgagor under or from the Collateral.

^^**RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEE ON DEFAULT**. Upon the occurrence of a Default (hereinafter defined) under this Mortgage, then in addition to all of Mortgagee’s rights as a “Secured Party” under the UCC or otherwise at law:

enforce and collect by legal action or otherwise, all indebtedness and obligations now or hereafter owing to Mortgagor in connection with or on account of any or all of the Collateral; and

^^In disposing of Collateral hereunder, Mortgagee may disclaim all warranties of title, possession, quiet enjoyment and the like. Any proceeds of any disposition of any Collateral may be applied by Mortgagee to the payment of expenses incurred by Mortgagee in connection with the foregoing, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, and the balance of such proceeds may be applied by Mortgagee toward the payment of the Secured Obligations in such order of application as Mortgagee may from time to time elect.

^^**POWER OF ATTORNEY**. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Mortgagor hereby authorize the Mortgagee to file and refile any financing statements, continuation statements, or other security agreements that the Mortgagee may require from time to time to confirm the lien of this Mortgage with respect to such property. Without limiting the foregoing, the Mortgagor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Mortgagee with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority (coupled with interest) in the place and stead of the Mortgagor and in the name of the Mortgagor or in the Mortgagee’s own name, for the Mortgagee to execute, deliver, and file such instruments for and on behalf of the Mortgagor. Notwithstanding any release of any or all of that property included in the Mortgaged Premises which is deemed to be “real property”, and proceedings to foreclose this Mortgage or its satisfaction of record, the terms hereof shall survive as a security agreement with respect to the security interest created hereby and referred to above until the repayment or satisfaction in full of the obligations of the Mortgagor as are now or hereafter secured hereby.

^^**POSSESSION AND USE OF COLLATERAL**. Except as otherwise provided in this Section or the other Loan Documents (as defined in the Loan Agreement), so long as no Default exists under this Mortgage or any of the Loan Documents, Mortgagor may possess, use, move, transfer or dispose of any of the Collateral in the ordinary course of Mortgagor’s business and in accordance with the Loan Agreement.

^^**TITLE**. Mortgagor represents and warrants that, except as disclosed to Mortgagee in a writing which refers to this warranty, Mortgagor lawfully holds and possesses fee simple title to the Subject Property without limitation on the right to encumber, and that this Mortgage is a first and prior lien on the Subject Property. Mortgagor hereby represents and warrants that all of the Subject Property is a single tax parcel, and there are no properties included in such tax parcel other than the Subject Property. Mortgagor further covenants and agrees that it shall not cause all or any portion of the Subject Property to be subdivided or for any lots or boundary lines to be adjusted, changed or altered for either ad valorem tax purposes or otherwise, and shall not consent to the assessment of the Subject Property in more than one tax parcel or in conjunction with any property other than the Subject Property.

^^**TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS**.

^^Subject to Mortgagor’s rights to contest in good faith payment of taxes as provided in Section 5.2(b) below, Mortgagor shall pay prior to delinquency all taxes,

\centered Page 7 

Loan No. 1002012 

assessments, levies and charges imposed by any public or quasi-public authority or utility company which are or which may become a lien upon or cause a loss in value of the Subject Property or any interest therein. Mortgagor shall also pay prior to delinquency all taxes, assessments, levies and charges imposed by any public authority upon Mortgagee by reason of its interest in any Secured Obligation or in the Subject Property, or by reason of any payment made to Mortgagee pursuant to any Secured Obligation; provided, however, Mortgagor shall have no obligation to pay taxes which may be imposed from time to time upon Mortgagee and which are measured by and imposed upon Mortgagee’s net income.

^^Mortgagor may contest in good faith any taxes or assessments if: (i) Mortgagor pursues the contest diligently and in compliance with applicable laws, in a manner which Mortgagee determines is not prejudicial to Mortgagee, and does not impair the rights of Mortgagee under any of the Loan Documents; and (b) Mortgagor deposits with Mortgagee any funds or other forms of assurance which Mortgagee in good faith determines from time to time appropriate to protect Mortgagee from the consequences of the contest being unsuccessful. Mortgagor’s compliance with this Section shall operate to prevent such claim, demand, levy or assessment from becoming a Default.

^^**TAX AND INSURANCE IMPOUNDS**. At any time following the occurrence of a Default, at Mortgagee’s option and upon its demand, Mortgagor shall, until all Secured Obligations have been paid in full, pay to Mortgagee monthly, annually or as otherwise directed by Mortgagee an amount estimated by Mortgagee to be equal to: (a) all taxes, assessments, levies and charges imposed by any public or quasi-public authority or utility company which are or may become a lien upon the Subject Property or Collateral and will become due for the tax year during which such payment is so directed; and (b) premiums for fire, hazard and insurance required or requested pursuant to the Loan Documents when same are next due. If Mortgagee determines that any amounts paid by Mortgagor are insufficient for the payment in full of such taxes, assessments, levies, charges and/or insurance premiums, Mortgagee shall notify Mortgagor of the increased amounts required to pay all amounts when due, whereupon Mortgagor shall pay to Mortgagee within thirty (30) days thereafter the additional amount as stated in Mortgagee’s notice. All sums so paid shall not bear interest, except to the extent and in any minimum amount required by law; and Mortgagee shall, unless Mortgagor is otherwise in Default hereunder or under any Loan Document, apply said funds to the payment of, or at the sole option of Mortgagee release said funds to Mortgagor for the application to and payment of, such sums, taxes, assessments, levies, charges, and insurance premiums. Upon Default by Mortgagor hereunder or under any Loan Document, Mortgagee may apply all or any part of said sums to any Secured Obligation and/or to cure such Default, in which event Mortgagor shall be required to restore all amounts so applied, as well as to cure any other events or conditions of Default not cured by such application. Upon assignment of this Mortgage, Mortgagee shall have the right to assign all amounts collected and in its possession to its assignee whereupon Mortgagee shall be released from all liability with respect thereto. Within ninety-five (95) days following full repayment of the Secured Obligations (other than full repayment of the Secured Obligations as a consequence of a foreclosure or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure of the liens and security interests securing the Secured Obligations) or at such earlier time as Mortgagee may elect, the balance of all amounts collected and in Mortgagee’s possession shall be paid to Mortgagor and no other party shall have any right or claim thereto.

^^**PERFORMANCE OF SECURED OBLIGATIONS**. Mortgagor shall promptly pay and perform each Secured Obligation for which it is responsible hereunder or under the Loan Agreement when due.

^^**LIENS, ENCUMBRANCES AND CHARGES**. Mortgagor shall immediately discharge any lien not approved by Mortgagee in writing that has or may attain priority over this Mortgage.

\centered Page 8 

Loan No. 1002012 

Subject to the provisions of the following sentence, Mortgagor shall pay when due all obligations secured by or which may become liens and encumbrances which shall now or hereafter encumber or appear to encumber all or any part of the Subject Property or Collateral, or any interest therein, whether senior or subordinate hereto. If a claim of lien, judgment or notice of unpaid balance and right to file lien is recorded which affects the Subject Property, Mortgagor shall, within twenty (20) calendar days of such recording or service or within five (5) calendar days of Mortgagee’s demand, whichever occurs first: (a) pay and discharge the claim of lien, judgment or amount in controversy pursuant to the notice of unpaid balance and right to file lien; (b) effect the release thereof by recording or delivering to Mortgagee a surety bond in sufficient form and amount; or (c) provide Mortgagee with other assurances which Mortgagee deems, in its sole discretion, to be satisfactory for the payment of such claim of lien or bonded stop notice and for the full and continuous protection of Mortgagee from the effect of such lien or bonded stop notice. 

^^**DAMAGES; INSURANCE AND CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS**.

^^The following (whether now existing or hereafter arising) are all absolutely and irrevocably assigned by Mortgagor to Mortgagee and, at the request of Mortgagee, shall be paid directly to Mortgagee: (i) all awards of damages and all other compensation payable directly or indirectly by reason of a condemnation or proposed condemnation for public or private use affecting all or any part of, or any interest in, the Subject Property or Collateral; (ii) all other claims and awards for damages to, or decrease in value of, all or any part of, or any interest in, the Subject Property or Collateral; (iii) all proceeds of any insurance policies (whether or not expressly required by Beneficiary to be maintained by Trustor, including, without limitation, earthquake insurance, environmental insurance and terrorism insurance, if any) payable by reason of loss sustained to all or any part of the Subject Property or Collateral; and (iv) all interest which may accrue on any of the foregoing. Subject to applicable law and Section 5.6(b) below, and without regard to any requirement contained in Section 5.7(d), Mortgagee may at its discretion apply all or any of the proceeds it receives to its expenses in settling, prosecuting or defending any claim and may apply the balance to the Secured Obligations in any such order acceptable to Mortgagee, and/or Mortgagee may release all or any part of the proceeds to Mortgagor upon any conditions Mortgagee may impose. Mortgagee may commence, appear in, defend or prosecute any assigned claim or action and may adjust, compromise, settle and collect all claims and awards assigned to Mortgagee; provided, however, in no event shall Mortgagee be responsible for any failure to collect any claim or award, regardless of the cause of the failure, including, without limitation, any malfeasance or nonfeasance by Mortgagee or its employees or agents.

^^Mortgagee shall permit insurance or condemnation proceeds held by Mortgagee to be used for repair or restoration but may condition such application upon reasonable conditions, including, without limitation: (i) the deposit with Mortgagee of such additional funds which Mortgagee determines are needed to pay all costs of the repair or restoration, (including, without limitation, taxes, financing charges, insurance and rent during the repair period); (ii) the establishment of an arrangement for lien releases and disbursement of funds acceptable to Mortgagee; (iii) the delivery to Mortgagee of plans and specifications for the work, a contract for the work signed by a contractor acceptable to Mortgagee, a cost breakdown for the work and a payment and performance bond for the work, all of which shall be acceptable to Mortgagee; and (iv) the delivery to Mortgagee of evidence acceptable to Mortgagee (aa) that after completion of the work the income from the Subject Property will be sufficient to pay all expenses and debt service for the Subject Property; (bb) of the continuation of Leases acceptable to and required by Mortgagee; (cc) that upon completion of the work, the size, capacity and total value of the Subject Property will be at least as

great as it was before the damage or condemnation occurred; (dd) that there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition or credit of Mortgagor since the date of this Mortgage; (ee) no Default shall have occurred; and (ff) of the satisfaction of any additional conditions that Mortgagee may reasonably establish to protect its security. Mortgagor hereby acknowledges that the conditions described above are reasonable, and, if such conditions have not been satisfied within sixty (60) days of receipt by Mortgagee of such insurance or condemnation proceeds, then Mortgagee may apply such insurance or condemnation proceeds to pay the Secured Obligations in such order and amounts as Mortgagee in its sole discretion may choose.

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.6, if the insurance or condemnation proceeds equal $[[USD Value 2: Number]] or less, Mortgagee shall release such proceeds to Mortgagor for repair or restoration of the Subject Property without any additional requirements or conditions.

^^**MAINTENANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY**. Subject to the provisions of the Loan Agreement, Mortgagor covenants: (a) to insure the Subject Property and Collateral against such risks as Mortgagee may require pursuant to the Loan Agreement and, at Mortgagee’s request (but not more than fifteen (15) days prior to the termination date of any existing coverage), to provide evidence of such insurance to Mortgagee, and to comply with the requirements of any insurance companies providing such insurance; (b) to keep the Subject Property and Collateral in good condition and repair; (c) not to remove or demolish the Subject Property or Collateral or any part thereof, not to alter, restore or add to the Subject Property or Collateral and not to initiate or acquiesce in any change in any zoning or other land classification which affects the Subject Property without Mortgagee’s prior written consent or as provided in the Loan Agreement; (d) to complete or restore promptly and in good and workmanlike manner the Subject Property and Collateral, or any part thereof which may be damaged or destroyed, without regard to whether Mortgagee elects to require that insurance proceeds be used to reduce the Secured Obligations as provided in Section 5.6; (e) to comply with all laws, ordinances, regulations and standards, and all covenants, conditions, restrictions and equitable servitudes, whether public or private, of every kind and character which affect the Subject Property or Collateral and pertain to acts committed or conditions existing thereon, including, without limitation, any work, alteration, improvement or demolition mandated by such laws, covenants or requirements; (f) not to commit or permit waste of the Subject Property or Collateral; and (g) to do all other acts which from the character or use of the Subject Property or Collateral may be reasonably necessary to maintain and preserve its value.

^^**DEFENSE AND NOTICE OF LOSSES, CLAIMS AND ACTIONS**. At Mortgagor’s sole expense, Mortgagor shall protect, preserve and defend the Subject Property and Collateral and title to and right of possession of the Subject Property and Collateral, the security hereof and the rights and powers of Mortgagee hereunder against all adverse claims. Mortgagor shall give Mortgagee prompt notice in writing of the assertion of any claim, of the filing of any action or proceeding, of the occurrence of any damage to the Subject Property or Collateral and of any condemnation offer or action.

^^**POWERS OF MORTGAGEE**. Mortgagee may, without affecting the personal liability of any person for payment of any indebtedness or performance of any obligations secured hereby and without liability therefor and without notice: (a) release all or any part of the Subject Property; (b) consent to the making of any map or plat thereof; and (c) join in any grant of easement thereon, any declaration of covenants and restrictions, or any extension agreement or any agreement subordinating the lien or charge of this Mortgage.

^^**COMPENSATION; EXCULPATION; INDEMNIFICATION**.

^^Mortgagor shall pay to Mortgagee reasonable compensation for services rendered concerning this Mortgage, including without limit any statement of amounts owing under any Secured Obligation. Mortgagee shall not directly or indirectly be liable to Mortgagor or any other person as a consequence of (i) the exercise of the rights, remedies or powers granted to Mortgagee in this Mortgage; (ii) the failure or refusal of Mortgagee to perform or discharge any obligation or liability of Mortgagor under any agreement related to the Subject Property or Collateral or under this Mortgage; or (iii) any loss sustained by Mortgagor or any third party resulting from Mortgagee’s failure (whether by malfeasance, nonfeasance or refusal to act) to lease the Subject Property after a Default (hereinafter defined) or from any other act or omission (regardless of whether same constitutes negligence) of Mortgagee in managing the Subject Property after a Default unless the loss is caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Mortgagee and no such liability shall be asserted against or imposed upon Mortgagee, and all such liability is hereby expressly waived and released by Mortgagor.

^^Mortgagor shall pay all amounts and indebtedness arising under this Section 5.10 immediately upon demand by Mortgagee together with interest thereon from the date the indebtedness arises at the rate of interest then applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified therein.

^^**DUE ON SALE OR ENCUMBRANCE**. The terms “Loan”, “Loan Documents” and “Loan Agreement” have the meaning given them in the Loan Agreement described in Section 2.1. Mortgagor represents, agrees and acknowledges that:

^^Improvement and operation of real property is a highly complex activity which requires substantial knowledge of law and business conditions and practices, and an ability to control, coordinate and schedule the many factors affecting such improvement and operation. Experience, financial stability, managerial ability and a good reputation in the business community enhance an owner’s and operator’s ability to obtain market rents and to induce cooperation in scheduling and are taken into account by Mortgagee in approving loan applications.

^^Mortgagor has represented to Mortgagee, not only in the representations and warranties contained in the Loan Documents, but also in its initial loan application and in all of the negotiations connected with Mortgagee making the Loan, certain facts concerning Mortgagor’s financial stability, managerial and operational ability, reputation, skill, and creditworthiness. Mortgagee has relied upon these representations and warranties as a substantial and material consideration in its decision to make the Loan.

^^The conditions and terms provided in the Loan Agreement were induced by these representations and warranties and would not have been made available by Mortgagee in the absence of these representations and warranties.

^^Mortgagee would not have made this Loan if Mortgagee did not have the right to sell, transfer, assign, or grant participations in the Loan and in the Loan Documents, and that such participations are dependent upon the potential participants’ reliance on such representations and warranties.

^^Mortgagor’s financial stability and managerial and operational ability and that of those persons or entities having a direct or beneficial interest in Mortgagor are a substantial

\centered Page 11 

Loan No. 1002012 

and material consideration to any third parties who have entered or will enter into agreements with Mortgagor.

^^Mortgagee has relied upon the skills and services offered by such third parties and the provision of such skills and services is jeopardized if Mortgagor breaches its covenants contained below regarding Transfers.

^^A transfer of possession of or title to the Subject Property, or a change in the person or entity operating, developing, constructing or managing the Subject Property, would substantially increase the risk of Default under the Loan Documents and significantly and materially impair and reduce Mortgagee’s security for the Note.

^^As used herein, the term “Transfer” shall mean each of the following actions or events: the sale, transfer, assignment, lease as a whole, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage or pledge in any manner whatsoever, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law of: (i) the Subject Property or Collateral or any interest therein; (ii) title to any other security more specifically described in any Loan Document; (iii) Mortgagor’s right, title and/or interest in the Loan Documents and any subsequent documents executed by Mortgagor in connection therewith; (iv) legal or beneficial ownership of any partnership interest in Mortgagor if Mortgagor is a partnership; (v) legal or beneficial ownership of any membership interest in Mortgagor if Mortgagor is a limited liability company; (vi) legal or beneficial ownership of any partnership interest in any general partner, venturer or member of Mortgagor; or (vii) legal or beneficial ownership of any of the stock in Mortgagor if Mortgagor is a corporation or in any general partner, venturer or member in Mortgagor that is a corporation.

^^Mortgagor shall not make or commit to make any Transfer without Mortgagee’s prior written consent, which it may grant or withhold at its sole discretion (except with respect to those Transfers reasonably approved by Mortgagee or otherwise expressly permitted under Sections 9.17, 9.18 and 9.19 of the Loan Agreement). It is expressly agreed that Mortgagee may predicate Mortgagee’s decision to grant consent to a Transfer on such terms and conditions as Mortgagee may require, in Mortgagee’s sole discretion, including without limitation (i) consideration of the creditworthiness of the party to whom such Transfer will be made and its development and management ability with respect to the Subject Property, (ii) consideration of whether the security for repayment, performance and discharge of the Secured Obligations, or Mortgagee’s ability to enforce its rights, remedies, and recourses with respect to such security, will be impaired in any way by the proposed Transfer, (iii) an increase in the rate of interest payable under the Note or any other change in the terms and provisions of the Note and other Loan Documents, (iv) reimbursement of Mortgagee for all costs and expenses incurred by Mortgagee in investigating the creditworthiness and management ability of the party to whom such Transfer will be made and in determining whether Mortgagee’s security will be impaired by the proposed Transfer, (v) payment to Mortgagee of a transfer fee to cover the cost of documenting the Transfer in its records, (vi) payment of Mortgagee’s reasonable attorneys’ fees in connection with such Transfer, (vii) endorsements (to the extent available under applicable law) to any existing mortgagee title insurance policies or construction binders insuring Mortgagee’s liens and security interests covering the Subject Property, and (viii) require additional security for the payment, performance and discharge of the Secured Obligations. If Mortgagee’s consent should be given, any Transfer shall be subject to the Loan Documents and any transferee of Mortgagor’s interest shall: (i) assume all of Mortgagor’s obligations thereunder; and (ii) agree to be bound by all provisions and perform all obligations contained therein; provided, however, that such assumption shall not release Mortgagor or any maker or any guarantor of the Note from any

\centered Page 12 

Loan No. 1002012 

liability thereunder or under any other Loan Documents without the prior written consent of Mortgagee. In the event of any Transfer without the prior written consent of Mortgagee, whether or not Mortgagee elects to enforce its right to accelerate the Loan pursuant to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, all sums owing under the Note, as well as all other charges, expenses and costs owing under the Loan Documents, shall at the option of Mortgagee, automatically bear interest at five percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) above the rate provided in the Note, from the date (or any date thereafter) of such unconsented to Transfer. Mortgagor acknowledges that the automatic shift(s) to this alternate rate is reasonable since the representations that Mortgagee relied upon in making the Loan may no longer be relied upon. A consent by Mortgagee to one or more Transfers shall not be construed as a consent to further Transfers or as a waiver of Mortgagee’s consent with respect to future Transfers.

^^**RELEASES, EXTENSIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL SECURITY**. Without notice to or the consent, approval or agreement of any persons or entities having any interest at any time in the Subject Property and Collateral or in any manner obligated under the Secured Obligations (“Interested Parties”), Mortgagee may, from time to time, release any person or entity from liability for the payment or performance of any Secured Obligation, take any action or make any agreement extending the maturity or otherwise altering the terms or increasing the amount of any Secured Obligation, or accept additional security or release all or a portion of the Subject Property and Collateral and other security for the Secured Obligations. None of the foregoing actions shall release or reduce the personal liability of any of said Interested Parties, or release or impair the priority of the lien of and security interests created by this Mortgage upon the Subject Property and Collateral.

^^**RELEASE**. Upon payment in full of all obligations secured hereby, Mortgagee shall release and discharge the Subject Property or that portion thereof then held hereunder. When the Subject Property has been fully released, the last such release shall operate as a reassignment of all future rents, issues and profits of the Subject Property to the person or persons legally entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Mortgagee hereby agrees, subject to the provisions of Section 2.10 of the Loan Agreement, to release and discharge the Subject Property, notwithstanding the fact that all of the Secured Obligations have not been satisfied.

^^**SUBROGATION**. Mortgagee shall be subrogated to the lien of all encumbrances, whether released of record or not, paid in whole or in part by Mortgagee pursuant to the Loan Documents or by the proceeds of any loan secured by this Mortgage.

^^**RIGHT OF INSPECTION**. Mortgagee, its agents and employees, may enter the Subject Property at any reasonable time for the purpose of inspecting the Subject Property and Collateral and ascertaining Mortgagor’s compliance with the terms hereof.

^^**CONTRACTS**. Mortgagor will deliver to Mortgagee a copy of each Contract promptly after the execution of same by all parties thereto and subject to any approval of Mortgagee required by any of the Loan Documents. Within twenty (20) days after a request by Mortgagee, Mortgagor shall prepare and deliver to Mortgagee a complete listing of all Contracts, showing date, term, parties, subject matter, concessions, whether any defaults exist, and other information specified by Mortgagee, of or with respect to each of such Contracts, together with a copy thereof (if so requested by Mortgagee). Mortgagor represents and warrants that none of the Contracts encumber or create a lien on the Subject Property, but are personal with Mortgagor. As used herein, the term “Contract” shall mean any management agreement, leasing and brokerage agreement, and operating or service contract with respect to the Subject Property or Collateral.

\centered Page 13 

Loan No. 1002012 

^^**DEFAULT**. For all purposes hereof, the term “Default” shall mean (a) the existence of any Event of Default as defined in the Loan Agreement; (b) at Mortgagee’s option, the failure of Mortgagor to make any payment of principal or interest on the Note or to pay any other amount due hereunder or under the Note when the same is due and payable, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise; (c) the failure of Mortgagor to perform any non-monetary obligation hereunder, or the failure to be true of any representation or warranty of Mortgagor contained herein and the continuance of such failure for ten (10) days after notice, or within any longer grace period, if any, allowed in the Loan Agreement for such failure, or (d) if Mortgagor or any other Person shall make a Transfer without the prior written consent of Mortgagee (which consent may be withheld in Mortgagee’s sole discretion (except for those Transfers reasonably approved by Mortgagee or otherwise expressly permitted under Sections 9.17, 9.18 and 9.19 of the Loan Agreement) or conditioned as provided in Section 5.11).

^^**RIGHTS AND REMEDIES**. At any time after Default, Mortgagee shall have all the following rights and remedies:

^^With or without notice, to declare all Secured Obligations immediately due and payable;

^^With or without notice, and without releasing Mortgagor from any Secured Obligation, and without becoming a mortgagee in possession, to cure any breach or Default of Mortgagor and, in connection therewith, to enter upon the Subject Property and do such acts and things as Mortgagee deems necessary or desirable to protect the security hereof, including, without limitation: (i) to appear in and defend any action or proceeding purporting to affect the security of this Mortgage or the rights or powers of Mortgagee under this Mortgage; (ii) to pay, purchase, contest or compromise any encumbrance, charge, lien or claim of lien which, in the sole judgment of Mortgagee, is or may be senior in priority to this Mortgage, the judgment of Mortgagee being conclusive as between the parties hereto; (iii) to obtain insurance; (iv) to pay any premiums or charges with respect to insurance required to be carried under this Mortgage; or (v) to employ counsel, accountants, contractors and other appropriate persons;

^^To commence and maintain an action or actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to foreclose this Mortgage or to obtain specific enforcement of the covenants of Mortgagor hereunder, and Mortgagor agrees that such covenants shall be specifically enforceable by injunction or any other appropriate equitable remedy and that for the purposes of any suit brought under this subparagraph, Mortgagor waives the defense of laches and any applicable statute of limitations;

^^To apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for and obtain appointment of a receiver of the Subject Property as a matter of strict right and without regard to the adequacy of the security for the repayment of the Secured Obligations, the existence of a declaration that the Secured Obligations are immediately due and payable, or the filing of a notice of default, and Mortgagor hereby consents to such appointment;

^^To enter upon, possess, manage and operate the Subject Property or any part thereof, to take and possess all documents, books, records, papers and accounts of Mortgagor or the then owner of the Subject Property, to make, terminate, enforce or modify Leases of the Subject Property upon such terms and conditions as Mortgagee deems proper, to make repairs, alterations and improvements to the Subject Property as necessary, in Mortgagee’s sole judgment, to protect or enhance the security hereof;

\centered Page 14 

Loan No. 1002012 

^^To resort to and realize upon the security hereunder and any other security now or later held by Mortgagee concurrently or successively and in one or several consolidated or independent judicial actions or lawfully taken non-judicial proceedings, or both, and to apply the proceeds received upon the Secured Obligations all in such order and manner as Mortgagee determines in its sole discretion;

^^Upon sale of the Subject Property at any foreclosure sale, Mortgagee may credit bid (as determined by Mortgagee in its sole and absolute discretion) all or any portion of the Secured Obligations. In determining such credit bid, Mortgagee may, but is not obligated to, take into account all or any of the following: (i) appraisals of the Subject Property as such appraisals may be discounted or adjusted by Mortgagee in its sole and absolute underwriting discretion; (ii) expenses and costs incurred by Mortgagee with respect to the Subject Property prior to foreclosure; (iii) expenses and costs which Mortgagee anticipates will be incurred with respect to the Subject Property after foreclosure, but prior to resale, including, without limitation, costs of structural reports and other due diligence, costs to carry the Subject Property prior to resale, costs of resale (e.g. commissions, attorneys’ fees, and taxes), costs of any hazardous materials clean-up and monitoring, costs of deferred maintenance, repair, refurbishment and retrofit, costs of defending or settling litigation affecting the Subject Property, and lost opportunity costs (if any), including the time value of money during any anticipated holding period by Mortgagee; (iv) declining trends in real property values generally and with respect to properties similar to the Subject Property; (v) anticipated discounts upon resale of the Subject Property as a distressed or foreclosed property; (vi) the fact of additional collateral (if any), for the Secured Obligations; and (vii) such other factors or matters that Mortgagee (in its sole and absolute discretion) deems appropriate. In regard to the above, Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that: (w) Mortgagee is not required to use any or all of the foregoing factors to determine the amount of its credit bid; (x) this Section does not impose upon Mortgagee any additional obligations that are not imposed by law at the time the credit bid is made; (y) the amount of Mortgagee’s credit bid need not have any relation to any loan-to-value ratios specified in the Loan Documents or previously discussed between Mortgagor and Mortgagee; and (z) Mortgagee’s credit bid may be (at Mortgagee’s sole and absolute discretion) higher or lower than any appraised value of the Subject Property;

^^Upon the completion of any foreclosure of all or a portion of the Subject Property, commence an action to recover any of the Secured Obligations that remains unpaid or unsatisfied; and

^^Exercise any and all other remedies available to Mortgagee at law or in equity, or under the Note, Loan Agreement or other Loan Documents for such Default.

^^**APPLICATION OF FORECLOSURE SALE PROCEEDS**.

^^**APPLICATION OF OTHER SUMS**. To the extent permitted by applicable law, all sums received by Mortgagee under Section 6.2 or Section 3.2, less all costs and expenses incurred by Mortgagee or any receiver under Section 6.2 or Section 3.2, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, shall be applied in payment of the Secured Obligations in such

\centered Page 15 

Loan No. 1002012 

order as Mortgagee shall determine in its sole discretion; provided, however, Mortgagee shall have no liability for funds not actually received by Mortgagee.

^^**NO CURE OR WAIVER**. Neither Mortgagee’s nor any receiver’s entry upon and taking possession of all or any part of the Subject Property and Collateral, nor any collection of rents, issues, profits, insurance proceeds, condemnation proceeds or damages, other security or proceeds of other security, or other sums, nor the application of any collected sum to any Secured Obligation, nor the exercise or failure to exercise of any other right or remedy by Mortgagee or any receiver shall cure or waive any breach, Default or notice of default under this Mortgage, or nullify the effect of any notice of default or sale (unless all Secured Obligations then due have been paid and performed and Mortgagor has cured all other defaults), or impair the status of the security, or prejudice Mortgagee in the exercise of any right or remedy, or be construed as an affirmation by Mortgagee of any tenancy, lease or option or a subordination of the lien of or security interests created by this Mortgage.

^^**PAYMENT OF COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES**. Mortgagor agrees to pay to Mortgagee immediately and without demand all costs and expenses incurred by Mortgagee (including, without limitation, post-judgment costs and expenses) pursuant to Section 6.2 (including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys’ fees, whether incurred in litigation or not) with interest from the date of expenditure until said sums have been paid at the rate of interest then applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified therein

^^**NOTICE OF SALE**. Mortgagee shall give Mortgagor reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale of the personal property or of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition of the personal property is to be made. Reasonable notice shall mean notice that is at least ten (10) days before the time of the sale or disposition.

^^**ELECTION OF REMEDIES**. Election by Mortgagee to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action or to perform an obligation of the Mortgagor under this Mortgage, after Mortgagor’s failure to perform, shall not affect Mortgagee’s right to declare a default and exercise its remedies. Nothing under this Mortgage or otherwise shall be construed so as to limit or restrict the rights and remedies available to Mortgagee following event of Default, or in any way to limit or restrict the rights and ability of Mortgagee to proceed directly against Mortgagor and/or against any other co-maker, guarantor, surety, or endorser, and/or to proceed against any other collateral, directly or indirectly securing the indebtedness.

^^**POWER TO FILE NOTICES AND CURE DEFAULTS**. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Mortgagor hereby irrevocably appoints Mortgagee and its successors and assigns, as its attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest, (a) to execute and/or record any notices of completion, cessation of labor, or any other notices that Mortgagee deems appropriate to protect Mortgagee’s interest, (b) upon the issuance of a deed pursuant to the foreclosure of the lien of this Mortgage or the delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, to execute all instruments of assignment or further assurance with respect to the Subject Property and Collateral, Leases and Payments in favor of the grantee of any such deed, as may be necessary or desirable for such purpose, (c) to prepare, execute and file or record financing statements, continuation statements, applications for registration and like papers necessary to create, perfect or preserve Mortgagee’s security interests and rights in or to any of the Subject Property and Collateral, and (d) upon the occurrence of an event, act or omission which, with notice or passage of time or both, would constitute a Default, Mortgagee may perform any obligation of Mortgagor hereunder; provided, however, that: (i) Mortgagee as such attorney-in-fact shall only be accountable for such funds as are actually received by Mortgagee; and (ii) Mortgagee shall not be liable to Mortgagor or any other person or entity for any failure to act (whether such failure constitutes negligence) by Mortgagee under this Section.

\centered Page 16 

Loan No. 1002012 

^^**REMEDIES CUMULATIVE**. All rights and remedies of Mortgagee provided hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to all rights and remedies provided by applicable law (including specifically that of foreclosure of this Mortgage) or in any other agreements between Mortgagor and Mortgagee. No failure on the part of Mortgagee to exercise any of its rights hereunder arising upon any Default shall be construed to prejudice its rights upon the occurrence of any other or subsequent Default. No delay on the part of Mortgagee in exercising any such rights shall be construed to preclude it from the exercise thereof at any time while that Default is continuing. Mortgagee may enforce any one or more remedies or rights hereunder successively or concurrently. By accepting payment or performance of any of the Secured Obligations after its due date, Mortgagee shall not thereby waive the agreement contained herein that time is of the essence, nor shall Mortgagee waive either its right to require prompt payment or performance when due of the remainder of the Secured Obligations or its right to consider the failure to so pay or perform a Default.

^^**ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS**. The Loan Documents contain or incorporate by reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect to matters contemplated herein and supersede all prior negotiations. The Loan Documents grant further rights to Mortgagee and contain further agreements and affirmative and negative covenants by Mortgagor which apply to this Mortgage and to the Subject Property and Collateral and such further rights and agreements are incorporated herein by this reference.

^^**MERGER**. No merger shall occur as a result of Mortgagee’s acquiring any other estate in, or any other lien on, the Subject Property unless Mortgagee consents to a merger in writing.

^^**OBLIGATIONS OF MORTGAGOR, JOINT AND SEVERAL**. If more than one person has executed this Mortgage as “Mortgagor”, the obligations of all such persons hereunder shall be joint and several.

^^**RECOURSE TO SEPARATE PROPERTY**. Any married person who executes this Mortgage as a Mortgagor agrees that any money judgment which Mortgagee obtains pursuant to the terms of this Mortgage or any other obligation of that married person secured by this Mortgage may be collected by execution upon that person’s separate property, and any community property of which that person is a manager.

^^**WAIVER OF MARSHALLING RIGHTS**. Mortgagor, for itself and for all parties claiming through or under Mortgagor, and for all parties who may acquire a lien on or interest in the Subject Property and Collateral, hereby waives all rights to have the Subject Property and Collateral and/or any other property, which is now or later may be security for any Secured Obligation (“Other Property”) marshalled upon any foreclosure of the lien of this Mortgage or on a foreclosure of any other lien or security interest against any security for any of the Secured Obligations. Mortgagee shall have the right to sell, and any court in which foreclosure proceedings may be brought shall have the right to order a sale of, the Subject Property and any or all of the Collateral or Other Property as a whole or in separate parcels, in any order that Mortgagee may designate.

^^**RULES OF CONSTRUCTION**. When the identity of the parties or other circumstances make it appropriate the masculine gender includes the feminine and/or neuter, and the singular number includes the plural. The term “Subject Property” and “Collateral” means all and any part of the Subject Property and Collateral, respectively, and any interest in the Subject Property and Collateral, respectively.

^^**SUCCESSORS IN INTEREST**. The terms, covenants, and conditions herein contained shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors and assigns of the parties

hereto; provided, however, that this Section 7.7 does not waive or modify the provisions of Section 6.2(e).

^^**EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS**. To facilitate execution, this document may be executed in as many counterparts as may be convenient or required. It shall not be necessary that the signature or acknowledgment of, or on behalf of, each party, or that the signature of all persons required to bind any party, or the acknowledgment of such party, appear on each counterpart. All counterparts shall collectively constitute a single document. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this document to produce or account for more than a single counterpart containing the respective signatures of, or on behalf of, and the respective acknowledgments of, each of the parties hereto. Any signature or acknowledgment page to any counterpart may be detached from such counterpart without impairing the legal effect of the signatures or acknowledgments thereon and thereafter attached to another counterpart identical thereto except having attached to it additional signature or acknowledgment pages.

^^**GOVERNING LAW**. This Mortgage shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey, except to the extent that federal laws preempt the laws of the State of New Jersey.

^^**INCORPORATION**. Exhibits A and B, as attached, are incorporated into this Mortgage by this reference.

^^**NOTICES**. All notices, demands or other communications required or permitted to be given pursuant to the provisions of this Mortgage shall be in writing and shall be considered as properly given if delivered personally or sent by certified United States mail, return receipt requested, or by Overnight Express Mail or by overnight commercial courier service, charges prepaid.

\centered **EXHIBIT B** 

\centered **NON-BORROWER MORTGAGOR RIDER** 

Exhibit B to Mortgage with Absolute Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing executed by KBSII MOUNTAIN VIEW, a Delaware limited liability, as Mortgagor, for the benefit of WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as administrative agent for itself and certain other lenders, as Mortgagee, dated as of [[Date 1]] (“Mortgage”). 

To the extent the Mortgage secures one or more promissory notes and other loan documents (“Loan Documents”) made by a party or parties (each individually, a “Borrower” and collectively, “Borrowers”) not identical to the party or parties constituting Mortgagor, the party or parties constituting Mortgagor agree as follows: 

^**CONDITIONS TO EXERCISE OF RIGHTS**. Mortgagor hereby waives any right it may now or hereafter have to require Mortgagee, as a condition to the exercise of any remedy or other right against Mortgagor hereunder or under any other document executed by Mortgagor in connection with any Secured Obligation: (a) to proceed against any Borrower or other person, or against any other collateral assigned to Mortgagee by Mortgagor or any Borrower or other person; (b) to pursue any other right or remedy in Mortgagee’s power; (c) except as required by applicable law, to give notice of the time, place or terms of any public or private sale of real or personal property collateral assigned to Mortgagee by any Borrower or other person (other than Mortgagor), or otherwise to comply with the New Jersey Commercial Code (as modified or recodified from time to time) with respect to any such personal property collateral; or (d) to make or give (except as otherwise expressly provided in the Loan Documents) any presentment, demand, protest, notice of dishonor, notice of protest or other demand or notice of any kind in connection with any Secured Obligation or any collateral (other than the Subject Property) for any Secured Obligation.

^**DEFENSES**. Mortgagor hereby waives any defense it may now or hereafter have that relates to: (a) any disability or other defense of any Borrowers or other person; (b) the cessation, from any cause other than full performance, of the obligations of Borrower or any other person; (c) the application of the proceeds of any Secured Obligation, by any Borrower or other person, for purposes other than the purposes represented to Mortgagor by any Borrower or otherwise intended or understood by Mortgagor or any Borrower; (d) any act or omission by Mortgagee which directly or indirectly results in or contributes to the release of any Borrower or other person or any collateral for any Secured Obligation; (e) the unenforceability or invalidity of any collateral assignment (other than the Mortgage) or guaranty with respect to any Secured Obligation, or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or lack of priority of any lien (other than the lien hereof) which secures any Secured Obligation; (f) any failure of Mortgagee to marshal assets in favor of Mortgagor or any other person; (g) any modification of any Secured Obligation, including any renewal, extension, acceleration or increase in interest rate; (h) any and all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by Mortgagee, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed Mortgagor’s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of law; (i) any law which provides that the obligation of a surety or guarantor must neither be larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal or which reduces a surety’s or guarantor’s obligation in proportion to the principal obligation; (j) any failure of Mortgagee to file or enforce a claim in any bankruptcy or other proceeding with respect to any person; (k) the election by Mortgagee, in any bankruptcy proceeding of any person, of the application or non-application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (l) any extension of credit or the grant of any lien under Section 364 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (m) any use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; or (n) any agreement or stipulation with respect to the provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy proceeding of any person. Mortgagor further waives any and all rights and defenses that Mortgagor may have because Borrowers’ debt is secured by real property; this means, among other things, that: (1) Mortgagee may collect from Mortgagor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by any Borrower or any other Person; (2) if Mortgagee forecloses on any real property

\centered Exhibit B-1 

Loan No. 1002012 

collateral pledged by any Borrower or any other Person, then (A) the amount of the debt may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (B) Mortgagee may collect from Mortgagor even if Mortgagee, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed any right Mortgagor may have to collect from Borrowers or any of them. The foregoing sentence is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Mortgagor may have because Borrowers’ debt is secured by real property. These rights and defenses being waived by Mortgagor include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580b, 580d or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure or any equivalent statutes or other applicable laws in the State of New Jersey. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision hereof, Mortgagor further expressly waives to the extent permitted by law any and all rights and defenses, including without limitation any rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution, which might otherwise be available to Mortgagor under California Civil Code Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433, or under California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580a, 580b, 580d and 726, or any of such sections, or any equivalent statutes or other applicable laws in the State of New Jersey.

^**SUBROGATION**. Mortgagor hereby waives, until such time as all Secured Obligations are fully performed: (a) any right of subrogation against any Borrower that relates to any Secured Obligation; (b) any right to enforce any remedy Mortgagor may now or hereafter have against any Borrower that relates to any Secured Obligation; and (c) any right to participate in any collateral now or hereafter assigned to Mortgagee with respect to any Secured Obligation.

^**BORROWER INFORMATION**. Mortgagor warrants and agrees: (a) that Mortgagee would not make or modify and extend the Loan but for this Mortgage; (b) that Mortgagor has not relied, and will not rely, on any representations or warranties by Mortgagee to Mortgagor with respect to the credit worthiness of any Borrower or the prospects of repayment of any Secured Obligations from sources other than the Subject Property; (c) that Mortgagor has established and/or will establish adequate means of obtaining from each Borrower on a continuing basis financial and other information pertaining to the business operations, if any, and financial condition of each Borrower; (d) that Mortgagor assumes full responsibility for keeping informed with respect to each Borrower’s business operations, if any, and financial condition; (e) that Mortgagee shall have no duty to disclose or report to Mortgagor any information now or hereafter known to Mortgagee with respect to any Borrower, including, without limitation, any information relating to any of Borrower’s business operations or financial condition; and (f) that Mortgagor is familiar with the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents and consents to all provisions thereof.

^**REINSTATEMENT OF LIEN**. Mortgagee’s rights hereunder shall be reinstated and revived, and the enforceability of this Mortgage shall continue, with respect to any amount at any time paid on account of any Secured Obligation which Mortgagee is thereafter required to restore or return in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to any Borrower.

^**SUBORDINATION**. Until all of the Secured Obligations have been fully paid and performed: (a) Mortgagor hereby agrees that all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of each Borrower to Mortgagor (collectively, the “Subordinated Debt”) shall be and are hereby subordinated to all Secured Obligations which constitute obligations of the applicable Borrower, and the payment thereof is hereby deferred in right of payment to the prior payment and performance of all such Secured Obligations; (b) Mortgagor shall not collect or receive any cash or non-cash payments on any Subordinated Debt or transfer all or any portion of the Subordinated Debt; and (c) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by, or distribution of assets of, any Borrower with respect to any Subordinated Debt is received by Mortgagor, such payment or distribution shall be held in trust and immediately paid over to Mortgagee, is hereby assigned to Mortgagee as security for the Secured Obligations, and shall be held by Mortgagee in an interest bearing account until all Secured Obligations have been fully paid and performed.

^**LAWFULNESS AND REASONABLENESS**. Mortgagor warrants that all of the waivers in this Mortgage are made with full knowledge of their significance, and of the fact that events giving rise to any defense or other benefit waived by Mortgagor may destroy or impair rights which Mortgagor would otherwise have against Mortgagee, Borrower and other persons, or against collateral.

\centered Exhibit B-2 

Loan No. 1002012 

Mortgagor agrees that all such waivers are reasonable under the circumstances and further agrees that, if any such waiver is determined (by a court of competent jurisdiction) to be contrary to any law or public policy, the other waivers herein shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect.

^**ENFORCEABILITY**. Mortgagor hereby acknowledges that: (a) the obligations undertaken by Mortgagor in this Mortgage are complex in nature, and (b) numerous possible defenses to the enforceability of these obligations may presently exist and/or may arise hereafter, and (c) as part of Mortgagee’s consideration for entering into this transaction, Mortgagee has specifically bargained for the waiver and relinquishment by Mortgagor of all such defenses, and (d) Mortgagor has had the opportunity to seek and receive legal advice from skilled legal counsel in the area of financial transactions of the type contemplated herein. Given all of the above, Mortgagor does hereby represent and confirm to Mortgagee that Mortgagor is fully informed regarding, and that Mortgagor does thoroughly understand: (i) the nature of all such possible defenses, and (ii) the circumstances under which such defenses may arise, and (iii) the benefits which such defenses might confer upon Mortgagor, and (iv) the legal consequences to Mortgagor of waiving such defenses. Mortgagor acknowledges that Mortgagor makes this Mortgage with the intent that this Mortgage and all of the informed waivers herein shall each and all be fully enforceable by Mortgagee, and that Mortgagee is induced to enter into this transaction in material reliance upon the presumed full enforceability thereof.

^**WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY THEN APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY TO THIS MORTGAGE, AND BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, BENEFICIARY, HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (a) ARISING UNDER THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE MODIFICATION THEREOF OR (b) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (AS NOW OR HEREAFTER MODIFIED) OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY AND BENEFICIARY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS DEED OF TRUST AND BENEFICIARY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO AND BENEFICIARY TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.**

^**INTEGRATION; INTERPRETATION**. This Mortgage and the other Loan Documents contain or expressly incorporate by reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters contemplated therein and supersede all prior negotiations or agreements, written or oral.
