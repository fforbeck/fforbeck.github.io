Ladies and Gentlemen: 

This loan agreement (this “Agreement”) will set forth certain understandings between [[Borrower]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (the “Borrower”), and [[Lender]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (the “Lender”), with respect to Term Loans (hereinafter defined) to be made by the Lender to the Borrower. In consideration of the mutual promises contained herein and in the other documents referred to below, and for other good and valuable consideration, receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Borrower and the Lender agree as follows: 

^^^AMOUNTS AND TERMS 

^^References to Documents. Reference is made to (i) that certain $[[USD Value 1: Number]] face principal amount promissory note (the “Term Note”) of even date herewith made by the Borrower and payable to the order of the Lender, (ii) that certain Guaranty Agreement (the “Guaranty”) of even date herewith jointly and severally made by the Subsidiary Guarantors (as hereinafter defined) in favor of the Lender, (iii) that certain Security Agreement (All Assets) (the “Security Agreement”) of even date herewith from the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor to the Lender, (iv) those certain Security Agreements (Patents), each of even date herewith from the Borrower to the Lender and from MDRNA Research, Inc. to the Lender (each, a “Patent Security Agreement” and collectively, the “Patent Security Agreements”), and (v) those certain Common Stock Purchase Warrants (each, a “Warrant” and collectively, the “Warrants”), each issued to the Lender by the Borrower. 

^^The Borrowing; Term Note. Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Lender will make one or more loans (the “Term Loans”) to the Borrower, as the Borrower may request, on any Business Day prior to the first to occur of (i) the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement by either party thereto, or (iii) the earlier termination of the within-described term loan facility pursuant to §5.2 or §6.5. Each such Term Loan shall be in such amount as may be requested by the Borrower; provided that (i) no Term Loan will be made after the first to occur of 

^the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or (B) the termination of the Merger Agreement by either party thereto; (ii) the aggregate original principal amounts of all Term Loans will not exceed $[[USD Value 1]]; (iii) no Term Loan will be in a principal amount of less than $[[USD Value 2: Number]] and (iv) not more than $[[USD Value 3: Number]] in aggregate original principal amounts of Term Loans may be requested by the Borrower in any consecutive thirty (30) day period. 

To request any Term Loan hereunder, the Borrower shall deliver to the Lender a borrowing notice in form and substance acceptable to Lender via facsimile or electronic mail, which borrowing notice shall set forth (i) the requested date of such Term Loan (which, with respect to the initial Term Loan, shall be a Business Day at least 15 days after the date of the corresponding borrowing notice and which, with respect to any subsequent Term Loan, shall be a Business Day at least 5 days after the date of the corresponding borrowing notice), and (ii) the amount of the Term Loan so requested. 

The Term Loans will be evidenced by the Term Note. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Lender to make or cause to be made, on a schedule attached to the Term Note or on the books of the Lender, at or following the time of making each Term Loan and of receiving any payment of principal, an appropriate notation reflecting such transaction and the then aggregate unpaid principal balance of the Term Loans. The amount so noted shall constitute presumptive evidence as to the amount owed by the Borrower with respect to principal of the Term Loans. Failure of the Lender to make any such notation shall not, however, affect any obligation of the Borrower or any right of the Lender hereunder or under the Term Note. 

^^Principal Repayment of Term Loans. The Borrower shall repay principal of the Term Loans in three (3) equal consecutive monthly installments, commencing on [[Date 2: Date]] and continuing on the fifteenth (15th) day of each month thereafter through and including [[Date 3: Date]]. Each such monthly installment of principal shall be in an amount equal to 1/3rd of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans outstanding at the close of business on [[Date 4: Date]]. In any event, the then outstanding aggregate principal balance of the Term Loans and all interest then accrued but unpaid thereon shall be due and payable in full on [[Date 3]]. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement is consummated prior to [[Date 2]], then on the date of the closing of such transaction, the then outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans and all interest then accrued but unpaid thereon shall be forgiven in full, the Term Note shall be cancelled and each of the Loan Documents shall be terminated. The Borrower may prepay, at any time or from time to time, without premium or penalty, the whole or any portion of any Term Loan; provided that (i) each such principal prepayment shall be accompanied by payment of all interest under the Term Note accrued but unpaid to the date of payment, and (ii) the Borrower gives the Lender at least five (5) days’ prior written notice of its intent to so prepay. Any partial prepayment of principal of the Term Loans will be applied in inverse order of normal maturity. Amounts repaid or prepaid with respect to the Term Loans are not available for reborrowing. 

^^Interest on Term Loans. The Borrower will pay interest on the principal amount of each Term Loan outstanding from time to time, from the date of the advance of such Term Loan until payment of such Term Loan and the Term Note in full and the termination of this Agreement. Interest on the Term Loans will be payable monthly in arrears, commencing on [[Date 2]] and continuing on the fifteenth (15th) day of each month thereafter until payment of the Term Loans in full, subject to forgiveness of the Term Loans in full upon the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement as described in §1.3 above. In any event, subject to forgiveness of the Term Loans in full upon the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement as described in §1.3 above, interest on the Term Loan shall also be paid on the date of payment of the Term Loan in full. Interest on each Term Loan will be payable at a fixed rate of ten ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) percent per annum; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Term Loan will, at the option of the Lender, bear interest at a rate per annum (the “Default Rate”) which at all times shall be equal to the sum of (i) four ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) percent per annum plus (ii) the per annum rate otherwise payable with respect thereto hereunder (but in no event in excess of the maximum rate from time to time permitted by then applicable law), compounded monthly and payable on demand. All interest payable under this Agreement and/or under the Term Note will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. If the entire amount of any required principal and/or interest payment is not paid within fifteen (15) days after the same is due, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender a late fee equal to five percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the required payment. 

^^Advances and Payments. The proceeds of all Term Loans shall be funded by the Lender to a general deposit account maintained by the Borrower at a bank in accordance with written instructions provided by the Borrower to the Lender. The proceeds of each Term Loan will be used by the Borrower solely for working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Borrower permitted by this Agreement. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lender to deduct from the proceeds of initial Term Loan, and to retain for the Lender’s benefit, the Lender’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses related to the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents. 

Whenever any payment to be made to the Lender hereunder or under the Term Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and interest payable on each such date shall include the amount thereof which shall accrue during the period of such extension of time. All payments by the Borrower hereunder and/or in respect of the Term Note shall be made net of any impositions or taxes and without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, notwithstanding any claim which the Borrower may now or at any time hereafter have against the Lender. All payments of interest, principal and any other sum payable hereunder and/or under the Term Note shall be made to the Lender, in immediately available funds, at its office at One Kendall Square, Building 700, [[Address 2: Address]] or to such other address as the Lender may from time to time direct. All payments received by the Lender after 2:00 p.m. (Boston time) on any day shall be deemed received as of the next succeeding Business Day. All monies received by the Lender shall be applied first to fees, charges, costs and expenses payable to the Lender under this Agreement, the 

Term Note and/or any of the other Loan Documents, next to interest then accrued on account of any Term Loans and only thereafter to principal of the Term Loans; provided that after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all monies received by the Lender shall be applied in such order as the Lender may determine in its sole discretion. All interest and fees payable hereunder and/or under the Term Note shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. 

^^Conditions to Advance. Prior to the making of the initial Term Loan, the Borrower shall deliver to the Lender duly executed copies of this Agreement, the Security Agreement, the Guaranty, each Patent Security Agreement, the Term Note, a Warrant and the documents and other items listed on the Closing Agenda delivered herewith by the Lender to the Borrower, all of which, as well as all legal matters incident to the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Lender and its counsel. On the date the initial Term Loan is made, all statements, representations and warranties of the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantors made in the Merger Agreement shall be correct in all material respects as of such date, and all covenants and agrees of the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor contained in the Merger Agreement shall have been complied with in all material respects on and as of such date. 

Without limiting the foregoing, any Term Loan (including the initial Term Loan) is subject to the further conditions precedent that on the date on which such Term Loan is made (and after giving effect thereto): 

^^All statements, representations and warranties of the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantors made in this Agreement, the Guaranty and/or in the Security Agreement shall continue to be correct in all material respects as of the date of such Term Loan. 

^^All covenants and agreements of the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor contained herein, in the Merger Agreement and/or in any of the Loan Documents shall have been complied with in all material respects on and as of the date of such Term Loan. 

^^No event which constitutes, or which with notice or lapse of time or both could reasonably be expected to constitute, an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, which has not been cured or waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 

^^No material adverse change shall have occurred in the financial condition of the Borrower from that disclosed in the financial statements then most recently furnished to the Lender. 

Each request by the Borrower for any Term Loan, and each acceptance by the Borrower of the proceeds of any Term Loan, will be deemed a representation and warranty by the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor that at the date of such Term Loan and after giving effect thereto all of the conditions set forth in the foregoing clauses (a) - (d) of this §1.6 will be satisfied. 

^^Termination Fee. If the Borrower is required to pay the termination fee pursuant to the terms of Section 9.02(d) of the Merger Agreement (the “Termination Fee”) and Borrower does not pay such Termination Fee when due as set forth in Section 9.02(d) of the Merger Agreement, then such Termination Fee shall added to the outstanding principal amount of the Term Note and deemed principal thereunder, and shall bear interest from the date thereof until the date when paid at a rate per annum equal to [[Percentage 2]]% per annum plus the per annum rate otherwise payable under the Term Note (but in no event in excess of the maximum rate permitted by then applicable law). The Termination Fee shall be an Obligation of the Borrower and shall be secured by the Security Agreement until all outstanding principal (other than that representing the Termination Fee) and all interest accrued and unpaid under the Term Note (other than that arising on such portion of principal representing the Termination Fee), and the fees, costs and expenses of Borrower due Lender hereunder in connection with the Term Loans, have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. Upon the indefeasible payment in full in cash of such principal, interest and fees, costs and expenses, such Termination Fee shall become unsecured, and all Liens and security interests on the Collateral securing the same shall be released upon the written request of, and at the cost and expense of, the Borrower. 

^^Warrant. As consideration for the establishment of the within-described Term Loan facility, the Borrower agrees to issue to the Lender on or about the date of each Term Loan hereunder, a Warrant to purchase shares of the Borrower’s capital stock, each such warrant to be exercisable for a number of shares of Borrower’s common stock equal to sixty-five percent ([[Percentage 4: Number]]%) of the principal amount of the Term Loan being made on such date divided by $[[USD Value 9: Number]]6 (subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination or the like). The obligations of the Borrower and the rights of the Lender under each Warrant will be effective upon the issuance thereof and will (until performed in full unless the Warrant is terminated or expires in accordance with its terms) survive payment of the Term Loans and the other Obligations and termination of this Agreement. In no event may any Warrant be exercised unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated, without the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Upon the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, all rights, including rights of exercise, under the Warrants shall terminate and be null and void.

Notwithstanding any this in this §6.5 to the contrary, each Warrant shall survive termination of this Agreement and payment in full of the Term Loans and the other Obligations in accordance with the express terms thereof. 

^^Consent to Jurisdiction. The Borrower irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any Massachusetts court or any federal court sitting within The Commonwealth of Massachusetts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Term Note and/or any of the other Loan Documents. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Borrower agrees that final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court shall be enforced in any court of proper jurisdiction by a suit upon such judgment, provided that service of process in such action, suit or proceeding shall have been effected upon the Borrower in one of the manners specified in the following paragraph of this §6.6 or as otherwise permitted by law.

^^Usury. All agreements between the Borrower and the Lender are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration of maturity of the Term Note or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Lender for the use or the forbearance of the Indebtedness represented by the Term Note exceed the maximum permissible under applicable law. In this regard, it is expressly agreed that it is the intent of the Borrower and the Lender, in the execution, delivery and acceptance of the Term Note, to contract in strict compliance with the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. If, under any circumstances whatsoever, performance or fulfillment of any provision of the Term Note or the other Loan Documents at the time such provision is to be performed or fulfilled shall involve exceeding the limit of validity prescribed by applicable law, then the obligation so to be performed or fulfilled shall be reduced automatically to the limits of such validity, and if under any circumstances whatsoever the Lender should ever receive as interest an amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance evidenced by the Term Note and not to the payment of interest. The provisions of this §6.9 shall control every other provision of this Agreement and of the Term Note. 

^^WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY MUTUALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM BASED HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TERM NOTE OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR OUT OF ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY.
