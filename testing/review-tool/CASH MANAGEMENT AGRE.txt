^^the Manager may aggregate sales and purchase orders for the Account with similar orders being made concurrently for other accounts managed by the Manager, if in the Manager’s reasonable judgment such aggregation shall result in an overall economic benefit to the Account, taking into consideration the selling or purchase price, brokerage commission and other expenses; in such case the actual prices applicable to the transaction will be averaged among the accounts for which the transaction is effected, including the Account; and
