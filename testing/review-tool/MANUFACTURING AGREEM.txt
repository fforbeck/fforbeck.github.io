If Buyer cannot practically return any such non-conforming Products or non­conforming assemblies or sub-assemblies to Seller, and Buyer has satisfied Seller that such Products or assemblies or sub-assemblies are indeed non-conforming and cannot be returned to Seller for repair, Seller will reimburse Buyer for Buyer's costs of making any necessary repairs on site; provided, however, that the amount of such reimbursement shall in no event exceed the amount paid by Buyer for such non-conforming Products. The foregoing obligations of Seller with respect to the repair of such Products, or assemblies or sub-assemblies, or refund with respect thereto, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer with respect to any failure of the Products to conform with the foregoing warranty. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the foregoing warranty by Seller shall not extend to or be applicable to any defects in the Products, or assemblies or subassemblies, or any failure of the Products, or assemblies or subassemblies, to meet the written specifications mutually agreed upon by the parties as a result of any defects in Buyer owned inventory which is incorporated into the Products. Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the failure of any of Seller's products, or any assemblies or sub-assemblies, to conform to the mutually agreed upon specifications is the result of a defective or non-conforming component supplied by any third party manufacturer, the foregoing warranty of Seller shall not be applicable thereto and Seller shall have no obligation with respect to the repair or replacement of such non-conforming Products or assemblies or sub­assemblies; and Buyer covenants and agrees to look solely to such third party manufacturer in accordance with the terms and conditions of any warranty provided by such third party manufacturer.

sold by Seller pursuant to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

^^Buyer shall be responsible for providing the specifications for the manufacture of the Products and Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that Seller's manufacture and sale of the Products based upon such specifications shall not infringe any patent, copyright or proprietary right of any third party.

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller's liability hereunder for damages, regardless of the form of action, and whether in contract or tort, with respect to any Purchase Order issued by Buyer to Seller, shall not exceed the total amount paid to Seller for Products pursuant to the applicable Purchase Order. In no event shall either party be liable to the other for special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. No action, regardless of the form thereof, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Purchase Order issued by Buyer to Seller pursuant hereto, may be brought by either party more than [*] after the cause of action has accrued, except in an action for non-payment may be brought within [*] of the date of the last payment.

^^In order to minimize the risk of a failure of a Product in the field, Buyer may, from time to time, inspect the assembly of the Product at Seller's facility and will be given notice of when the Product is expected to be completed. Seller will make Seller's facilities available to Buyer to allow Buyer to conduct quality assurance and final testing procedures to insure compliance of the Product with all applicable specifications.

^^The Seller shall supply, at its own expense, all equipment required for the purpose of manufacturing the Products. The Seller shall maintain, at its own expense, the facility, including, without limitation, the equipment, in a state of repair and operating efficiency consistent with the requirements of the Specifications for the Products, good manufacturing practices in a manner consistent with ISO 9002 or other guidelines typically required by Buyer's customers, and other applicable legal requirements.
