^^Effect of Administrator’s Decision. The Administrator’s decisions, determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all Grantees and any other holders of Awards.

^Eligibility and General Conditions of Awards. 

^^Eligibility. Awards other than Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees and Consultants. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees. If otherwise eligible, an Employee or Consultant who has been granted an Award may be granted additional Awards.

^^Maximum Term. Subject to the following provision, the term during which an Award may be outstanding shall not extend more than ten years after the Date of Grant, and shall be subject to earlier termination as specified elsewhere in the Plan or Award Agreement; provided, however, that any deferral of a cash payment or of the delivery of Shares that is permitted or required by the Administrator pursuant to Section 10 of the Plan may, if so permitted or required by the Administrator, extend more than ten years after the Date of Grant of the Award to which the deferral relates.

^^Award Agreement. To the extend not set forth in the Plan, the terms and conditions of each Award, which need not be the same for each grant or for each Grantee, shall be set forth in an Award Agreement. The Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, may require as a condition to any Award Agreement’s effectiveness that the Award Agreement be executed by the Grantee, including by electronic signature or other electronic indication of acceptance, and that the Grantee agree to such further terms and conditions as specified in the Award Agreement.

^^Termination of Employment or Consulting Relationship. In the event that a Grantee’s Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates (other than upon the Grantee’s death or Disability), then, unless otherwise provided by the Award Agreement, and subject to Section 11 of the Plan:

^^^the Grantee may exercise his or her unexercised Option or SAR, but only within such period of time as is determined by the Administrator, and only to the extent that the Grantee was entitled to exercise it at the Date of Termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator shall determine such period of time (in no event to exceed three months from the Date of Termination) when the Option is granted. If, at the Date of Termination, the Grantee is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option or SAR, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan. If, after the Date of Termination, the Grantee does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option or SAR shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan. An Award Agreement may also provide that if the exercise of an Option following the Date of Termination would be prohibited at any time because the issuance of Shares would violate Company policy regarding compliance with Applicable Law, then the exercise period shall terminate on the earlier of (A) the expiration of the term of the Option set forth in Section 6(b) of the Plan or (B) the expiration of a period of 10 days after the Date of Termination during which the exercise of the Option would not be in violation of such requirements; 

^^^the Grantee’s Stock Awards, to the extent forfeitable immediately before the Date of Termination, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited; 

^^^^^ 
^^^the Grantee’s Stock Awards that were not forfeitable immediately before the Date of Termination shall promptly be settled by delivery to the Grantee of a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of the Grantee’s vested Stock Awards; 

^^^any Performance Shares or Performance Units with respect to which the Performance Period has not ended as of the Date of Termination shall terminate immediately upon the Date of Termination. 

^^Disability of Grantee. In the event that a Grantee’s Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates as a result of the Grantee’s Disability, then, unless otherwise provided by the Award Agreement:

^^^the Grantee may exercise his or her unexercised Option or SAR at any time within 12 months from the Date of Termination, but only to the extent that the Grantee was entitled to exercise the Option or SAR at the Date of Termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement). If, at the Date of Termination, the Grantee is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option or SAR, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan. If, after the Date of Termination, the Grantee does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein, the Option or SAR shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan. 

^^^the Grantee’s Stock Awards, to the extent forfeitable immediately before the Date of Termination, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited; 

^^^the Grantee’s Stock Awards that were not forfeitable immediately before the Date of Termination shall promptly be settled by delivery to the Grantee of a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of the Grantee’s vested Stock Awards; 

^^^any Performance Shares or Performance Units with respect to which the Performance Period has not ended as of the Date of Termination shall terminate immediately upon the Date of Termination. 

^^Death of Grantee. In the event of the death of an Grantee, then, unless otherwise provided by the Award Agreement,

^^^the Grantee’s unexercised Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within 12 months following the date of death (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Grantee’s estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent that the Grantee was entitled to exercise the Option or SAR at the date of death. If, at the time of death, the Grantee was not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option or SAR, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option or SAR shall immediately revert to the Plan. If, after death, the Grantee’s estate or a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance does not exercise the Option or SAR within the time specified herein, the Option or SAR shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan. 

^^^the Grantee’s Stock Awards, to the extent forfeitable immediately before the date of death, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited; 

^^^the Grantee’s Stock Awards that were not forfeitable immediately before the date of death shall promptly be settled by delivery to the Grantee’s estate or a person who acquired the right to hold the Stock Grant by bequest or inheritance, of a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of the Grantee’s vested Stock Awards; 

^^^^^ 
^^^any Performance Shares or Performance Units with respect to which the Performance Period has not ended as of the date of death shall terminate immediately upon the date of death. 

^^Buyout Provisions. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5(g), the Administrator may at any time offer to buy out, for a payment in cash or Shares, an Award previously granted, based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate to the Grantee at the time that such offer is made. No such buy out shall occur without the prior approval or consent of the Company’s stockholders. Any such cash offer made to an Officer or Director shall comply with the provisions of Rule 16b-3 relating to cash settlement of stock appreciation rights. This provision is intended only to clarify the powers of the Administrator and shall not in any way be deemed to create any rights on the part of Grantees to buyout offers or payments.

^^^Except as provided in Section 5(h)(iii) below, each Award, and each right under any Award, shall be exercisable only by the Grantee during the Grantee’s lifetime, or, if permissible under Applicable Law, by the Grantee’s guardian or legal representative.

^^^To the extent and in the manner permitted by Applicable Law, and to the extent and in the manner permitted by the Administrator, and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Administrator, a Grantee may transfer an Award to:

^^Limitations. 

^^^^^

^shall not have an aggregate Fair Market Value (determined for each Incentive Stock Option at the Date of Grant) of Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Grantee during any calendar year (under the Plan and any other employee stock option plan of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary (“Other Plans”)), determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, that exceeds $[[USD Value 1: Number]] (the “$[[USD Value 1]] Limit”); 

^shall, if the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares (determined on the Date of Grant) with respect to the portion of such grant that is exercisable for the first time during any calendar year (“Current Grant”) and all Incentive Stock Options previously granted under the Plan and any Other Plans that are exercisable for the first time during a calendar year (“Prior Grants”) would exceed the $[[USD Value 1]] Limit, be exercisable as follows: 

^The portion of the Current Grant that would, when added to any Prior Grants, be exercisable with respect to Shares that would have an aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the respective Date of Grant for such Options) in excess of the $[[USD Value 1]] Limit shall, notwithstanding the terms of the Current Grant, be exercisable for the first time by the Grantee in the first subsequent calendar year or years in which it could be exercisable for the first time by the Grantee when added to all Prior Grants without exceeding the $[[USD Value 1]] Limit; and 

^If, viewed as of the date of the Current Grant, any portion of a Current Grant could not be exercised under the preceding provisions of this Section 6(a)(i)(B) during any calendar year commencing with the calendar year in which it is first exercisable through and including the last calendar year in which it may by its terms be exercised, such portion of the Current Grant shall not be an Incentive Stock Option, but shall be exercisable as a separate Option at such date or dates as are provided in the Current Grant. 

^^^No Employee shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the Company, Options to purchase more than [[Shares 1: Number]] Shares. The limitation described in this Section 6(a)(ii) shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company’s capitalization as described in Section 11 of the Plan. If an Option is canceled in the same fiscal year of the Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 11 of the Plan), the canceled Option will be counted against the limitation described in this Section 6(a)(ii). 

^^Term of Option. The term of each Option shall be stated in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be 10 years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.

^In the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who on the Date of Grant owns stock representing more than 10 percent of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110 percent of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Date of Grant. 

^^^^^ 
^Any Option that is (1) granted to a Grantee in connection with the acquisition (“Acquisition”), however effected, by the Company of another corporation or entity (“Acquired Entity”) or the assets thereof, (2) associated with an option to purchase shares of stock or other equity interest of the Acquired Entity or an affiliate thereof (“Acquired Entity Option”) held by such Grantee immediately prior to such Acquisition, and (3) intended to preserve for the Grantee the economic value of all or a portion of such Acquired Entity Option, may be granted with such exercise price as the Administrator determines to be necessary to achieve such preservation of economic value. 

^Any Option that is granted to a Grantee not previously employed by the Company, or a Parent or Subsidiary, as a material inducement to the Grantee’s commencing employment with the Company may be granted with such exercise price as the Administrator determines to be necessary to provide such material inducement. 

^^Waiting Period and Exercise Dates. At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and shall determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised. An Option shall be exercisable only to the extent that it is vested according to the terms of the Award Agreement.

^^Form of Consideration. The Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. The acceptable form of consideration may consist of any combination of cash, personal check, wire transfer or, subject to the approval of the Administrator:

^^^pursuant to rules and procedures approved by the Administrator, promissory note; 

^^^Mature Shares;  

^^^pursuant to procedures approved by the Committee, (A) through the sale of the Shares acquired on exercise of the Option through a broker-dealer to whom the Grantee has submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise and irrevocable instructions to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds sufficient to pay the exercise price, together with, if requested by the Company, the amount of federal, state, local or foreign withholding taxes payable by the Grantee by reason of such exercise, or (B) through simultaneous sale through a broker of Shares acquired upon exercise; or 

^^^such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. 

^^Exercise of Option. 

^^^Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder. 

^Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. 

^An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. 

^An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: 

^written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement and any action taken by the Administrator pursuant to Section 4(b) of the Plan or otherwise) from 

^^^^^ 
the person entitled to exercise the Option, and 

^full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. 

^Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Grantee or, if requested by the Grantee, in the name of the Grantee and his or her spouse. Until the stock certificate evidencing such Shares is issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 11 of the Plan. 

^Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised. 

^Stock Appreciation Rights.  

^^Grant of SARs. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Administrator may grant SARs in tandem with an Option or alone and unrelated to an Option. Tandem SARs shall expire no later than the expiration of the underlying Option.

^^Limitation. No Employee shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the Company, SARs covering more than [[Shares 1]] Shares. The limitation described in this Section 7(b) shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company’s capitalization as described in Section 11 of the Plan. If a SAR is canceled in the same fiscal year of the Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 11 of the Plan), the canceled SAR will be counted against the limitation described in this Section 7(b).

^^Exercise of SARs. SARs shall be exercised by the delivery of a written or electronic notice of exercise to the Company (in accordance with the Award Agreement and any action taken by the Administrator pursuant to Section 4(b) of the Plan or otherwise), setting forth the number of Shares over which the SAR is to be exercised. Tandem SARs may be exercised:

^^^with respect to all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option; 

^^^only with respect to the Shares for which its related Option is then exercisable; and 

^^^only when the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Option exceeds the exercise price of the Option. 

The value of the payment with respect to the tandem SAR may be no more than 100 percent of the difference between the exercise price of the underlying Option and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the underlying Option at the time the tandem SAR is exercised. 

^^Payment of SAR Benefit. Upon exercise of a SAR, the Grantee shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:

^^^^^ 
^^^the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the SAR exercise price; by 

^^^the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised; 

provided, that the Administrator may provide in the Award Agreement that the benefit payable on exercise of an SAR shall not exceed such percentage of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant as the Administrator shall specify. As determined by the Administrator, the payment upon exercise of an SAR may be in cash, in Shares that have an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date of exercise of the SAR) equal to the amount of the payment, or in some combination thereof, as set forth in the Award Agreement. 

^Stock Awards.  

^^Authorization to Grant Stock Awards. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Administrator may grant Stock Awards to Employees or Consultants from time to time. A Stock Award may be made in Shares or denominated in units representing rights to receive Shares. Each Stock Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall set forth the conditions, if any, which will need to be timely satisfied before the Stock Award will be effective and the conditions, if any, under which the Grantee’s interest in the related Shares or units will be forfeited. A Stock Award made in Shares that are subject to forfeiture conditions and/or other restrictions may be designated as an Award of ‘Restricted Stock.’ A Stock Award denominated in units that are subject to forfeiture conditions and/or other restrictions may be designated as an Award of ‘Restricted Stock Units.’ No more than [[Shares 1]] Shares or units may be granted pursuant to Stock Awards to an individual Grantee in any calendar year.

^^Code Section 162(m) Provisions. 

^^^Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) determines at the time a Stock Award is granted to a Grantee that such Grantee is, or may be as of the end of the tax year for which the Company would claim a tax deduction in connection with such Stock Award, a “covered employee” within the meaning of Section 162(m)(3) of the Code, and to the extent the Compensation Committee considers it desirable for compensation delivered pursuant to such Stock Award to be eligible to qualify for an exemption from the limit on tax deductibility of compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, then the Compensation Committee may provide that this Section 8(b) is applicable to such Stock Award under such terms as the Compensation Committee shall determine. 

^^^If a Stock Award is subject to this Section 8(b), then the lapsing of restrictions thereon and the distribution of Shares pursuant thereto, as applicable, shall be subject to satisfaction of one, or more than one, objective performance targets. The Compensation Committee shall determine the performance targets that will be applied with respect to each Stock Award subject to this Section 8(b) at the time of grant, but in no event later than 90 days after the commencement of the period of service to which the performance target(s) relate. The performance criteria applicable to Stock Awards subject to this Section 8(b) will be one or more of the following criteria: (A) stock price; (B) market share; (C) sales; (D) earnings per share, core earnings per share or variations thereof; (E) return on equity; (F) costs; (G) revenue; (H) cash to cash cycle; (I) days payables outstanding; (J) days of supply; (K) days sales outstanding; (L) cash flow; (M) operating income; (N) profit after tax; (O) profit before tax; (P) return on assets; (Q) return on sales; (R) inventory turns; (S) invested capital; (T) net operating profit after tax; (U) return on invested capital; (V) total shareholder return; (W) earnings; (X) return on equity or average shareowners’ equity; (Y) total shareowner return; (Z) return on capital; (AA) return on investment; (BB) income or net income; (CC) operating income or net operating income; (DD) operating profit or net operating profit; (EE) operating margin; (FF) return on operating revenue; (GG) contract awards or backlog; (HH) overhead or other expense reduction; (II) growth in shareowner value relative to the moving average of the S&P 500 Index or a peer group index; (JJ) credit rating; (KK) strategic plan development and implementation; (LL) net cash provided by operating activities; (MM) gross margin; (NN) economic value added; (OO) customer satisfaction; (PP) financial return ratios; and/or (QQ) market performance. 

^^^^^ 
^^^Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan, the Compensation Committee may not increase the number of shares granted pursuant to any Stock Award subject to this Section 8(b), nor may it waive the achievement of any performance target established pursuant to this Section 8(b). 

^^^Prior to the payment of any Stock Award subject to this Section 8(b), the Compensation Committee shall certify in writing that the performance target(s) applicable to such Stock Award was met. 

^^^The Compensation Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on Stock Awards subject to this Section 8(b) as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such Stock Awards satisfy all requirements for “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Code section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder, and any successors thereto. 

^Performance Units and Performance Shares. 

^^Grant of Performance Units and Performance Shares. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Administrator may grant Performance Units or Performance Shares to any Employee or Consultant in such amounts and upon such terms as the Administrator shall determine.

^^Value/Performance Goals. Each Performance Unit shall have an initial value that is established by the Administrator on the Date of Grant. Each Performance Share shall have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant. The Administrator shall set performance goals that, depending upon the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance Units or Performance Shares that will be paid to the Grantee.

^^Payment of Performance Units and Performance Shares.

^^^Subject to the terms of the Plan, after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units or Performance Shares shall be entitled to receive a payment based on the number and value of Performance Units or Performance Shares earned by the Grantee over the Performance Period, determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved. 

^^^If a Grantee is promoted, demoted or transferred to a different business unit of the Company during a Performance Period, then, to the extent the Administrator determines appropriate, the Administrator may adjust, change or eliminate the performance goals or the applicable Performance Period as it deems appropriate in order to make them appropriate and comparable to the initial performance goals or Performance Period. 

^^Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units and Performance Shares. Payment of earned Performance Units or Performance Shares shall be made in a lump sum following the close of the applicable Performance Period. The Administrator may pay earned Performance Units or Performance Shares in cash or in Shares (or in a combination thereof) that have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units or Performance Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period. Such Shares may be granted subject to any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Administrator. The form of payout of such Awards shall be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the Award.

^Deferral of Receipt of Payment. The Administrator may permit or require a Grantee to defer receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due by virtue of the exercise of an Option or SAR, the grant of or the lapse or waiver of restrictions with respect to Stock Awards or the satisfaction of any requirements or goals with respect to Performance Units or Performance Shares. If any such deferral is required or permitted, the Administrator shall establish such rules and procedures for such deferral. 

^Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Change of Control. 

^^Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the

^^^^^ 
Company, the number of Covered Shares, and the number of shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Award, as well as the price per share of Covered Stock, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been “effected without receipt of consideration.” Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Covered Stock. 

^^Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, then the following provisions shall apply:

^^^Vesting. Any Award outstanding on the date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred that is not yet exercisable and vested on such date: 

^shall become fully exercisable and vested on the first anniversary of the date of such Change in Control (the “Change in Control Anniversary”) if the Grantee’s Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant does not terminate prior to the Change in Control Anniversary; 

^shall become fully exercisable and vested on the Date of Termination if the Grantee’s Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates prior to the Change in Control Anniversary as a result of termination by the Company without Cause or resignation by the Grantee for Good Reason; or 

^shall not become full exercisable and vested if the Grantee’s Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates prior to the Change in Control Anniversary as a result of termination by the Company for Cause or resignation by the Grantee without Good Reason. 

For purposes of this Section 11(b)(i), the following definitions shall apply: 

^“Cause” means:  

^A Grantee’s conviction of a crime involving fraud or dishonesty; or 

^A Grantee’s continued willful or reckless material misconduct in the performance of the Grantee’s duties after receipt of written notice from the Company concerning such misconduct; 

provided, however, that for purposes of Section 11(b)(i)(D)(2), Cause shall not include any one or more of the following: bad judgment, negligence or any act or omission believed by the Grantee in good faith to have been in or not opposed to the interest of the Company (without intent of the Grantee to gain, directly or indirectly, a profit to which the Grantee was not legally entitled). 

^“Good Reason” means:  

^The assignment to the Grantee of any duties inconsistent in any respect with the Grantee’s position (including status, titles and reporting requirement), authority, duties or responsibilities, or any other action by the Company that results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action that is not taken in bad faith and that is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of written notice thereof given by the Grantee 

^^^^^ 
within 30 days following the assignment or other action by the Company; 

^Any reduction in compensation; or  

^Change in location of office of more than 35 miles without prior consent of the Grantee. 

^^^Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, to the extent that an Award is outstanding, it will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option or SAR shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Grantee the right to exercise his or her Option or SAR as to all or any part of the Covered Stock, including Shares as to which the Option or SAR would not otherwise be exercisable. 

^^^Merger or Asset Sale. Except as otherwise determined by the Board, in its discretion, prior to the occurrence of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, in the event of such a merger or sale each outstanding Option or SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right shall be substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation does not agree to assume the Option or SAR or to substitute an equivalent option or right, the Administrator shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the Grantee to have the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all or a portion of the Covered Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Administrator makes an Option or SAR exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Grantee that the Option or SAR shall be fully exercisable for a period of 15 days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR will terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the option or right confers the right to purchase, for each Share of Covered Stock subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or sale of assets was not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation and the participant, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in Fair Market Value to the per Share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets. 

^^^Except as otherwise determined by the Board, in its discretion, prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control other than the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, in the event of such a Change in Control, all outstanding Options and SARs, to the extent they are exercisable and vested (including Options and SARs that shall become exercisable and vested pursuant to Section 11(b)(i) above), shall be terminated in exchange for a cash payment equal to the Change in Control Price (reduced by the exercise price applicable to such Options or SARs). These cash proceeds shall be paid to the Grantee or, in the event of death of an Grantee prior to payment, to the estate of the Grantee or to a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance. 

^Term of Plan. The Plan shall become effective upon its approval by the stockholders of the Company within 12 months after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board. Such stockholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under applicable federal and state law. The Plan shall continue in effect until [[Date 2: Date]], unless terminated earlier under Section 13 of the Plan. 

^Amendment and Termination of the Plan. 

^^Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.

^^^^^ 
^^Stockholder Approval. The Company shall obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Rule 16b-3 or with Section 422 of the Code (or any successor rule or statute or other applicable law, rule or regulation, including the requirements of any exchange or quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted). Furthermore, the Company shall obtain stockholder approval of any modification or amendment of the Plan to the extent that the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, reasonably determines, in accordance with the requirements of any exchange or quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted, that such modification or amendment constitutes a material revision or material amendment of the Plan. Such stockholder approval, if required, shall be obtained in such a manner and to such a degree as is required by the applicable law, rule or regulation.

^^Effect of Amendment or Termination. No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Grantee, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Grantee and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Grantee and the Company.

^Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.  

^^Legal Compliance. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to an Award unless the exercise, if applicable, of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, Applicable Law, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

^^Investment Representations. As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.

^Liability of Company.  

^^Inability to Obtain Authority. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company’s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

^^Grants Exceeding Allotted Shares. If the Covered Stock covered by an Award exceeds, as of the date of grant, the number of Shares that may be issued under the Plan without additional stockholder approval, such Award shall be void with respect to such excess Covered Stock, unless stockholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of Shares subject to the Plan is timely obtained in accordance with Section 13 of the Plan.

^Reservation of Shares. The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. 

^Rights of Employees and Consultants. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall confer upon an Grantee any right with respect to continuing the Grantee’s employment or consulting relationship with the Company, nor shall they interfere in any way with the Grantee’s right or the Company’s right to terminate such employment or consulting relationship at any time, with or without cause. 

^Sub-plans for Foreign Subsidiaries. The Board may adopt sub-plans applicable to particular foreign Subsidiaries. All Awards granted under such sub-plans shall be treated as grants under the Plan. The rules of such sub-plans may take precedence over other provisions of the Plan, with the exception of Section 3, but unless otherwise superseded by the terms of such sub-plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern the operation of such sub-plan.
