Any increase in the size of the Board pursuant to this Bye-law 12(1) shall be deemed to be a vacancy and may be filled in accordance with Bye-law 16 hereof.

A Director shall hold office until the annual general meeting for the year in which his term expires, subject to his office being vacated pursuant to Bye-law 15 or . Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Director shall hold office until such Director’s successor shall have been duly elected or until they are removed from office by the Shareholders pursuant to **Bye-law 15** or their office is otherwise vacated. In the event of any change in the number of Directors, the Board of Directors shall apportion any newly created directorships among, or reduce the number of directorships in, such class or classes as shall equalize, as nearly as possible, the number of Directors in each class.

^Defects in Appointment Of Directors

All acts done bona fide by any meeting of the Board or by a committee of the Board or by any person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director.

^Shareholder Proposals and Nominations

^If a Shareholder desires to submit a proposal for consideration at an annual general meeting or special general meeting, or to nominate persons for election as Directors at any general meeting duly called for the election of Directors, written notice of such Shareholder’s intent to make such a proposal or nomination must be given and received by the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office or registered office of the Company not later than (i) with respect to an annual general meeting of Shareholders, ninety (90) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual general meeting, and (ii) with respect to a special general meeting, the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first sent or given to Shareholders. Each notice shall describe the proposal or nomination in sufficient detail for a proposal or nomination to be summarized on the agenda for the meeting and shall set forth (i) the name and address, as it appears on the books of the Company, of the Shareholder who intends to make the proposal or nomination; (ii) a representation that the Shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to present such proposal or nomination; and (iii) the class and number of shares of the Company which are beneficially owned by the Shareholder. In addition, in the case of a Shareholder’s proposal, the notice shall set forth the reasons for conducting such proposed business at the meeting and any material interest of the Shareholder in such business.

^In the case of a nomination of any person for election as a Director, the notice shall set forth: (i) the name and address of any person to be nominated; (ii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the Shareholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the Shareholder; (iii) such other information regarding such nominee proposed by such Shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of the United States of America, whether or not the Company is then subject to such Regulation; and (iv) the consent of each nominee to serve as a Director of the Company, if so elected.

^The chairman of the annual general meeting or special general meeting shall, if the facts warrant (as he may determine), refuse to acknowledge a proposal or nomination not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure, and any such proposal or nomination not properly brought before the meeting shall not be considered.

^Notwithstanding anything contained in these Bye-laws to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/[[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the total combined voting power of all the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (after giving effect to any adjustments or eliminations of voting power under Bye-laws 49-53 (inclusive)) shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any Bye-law provision inconsistent with, this Bye-law 14.

^A vacancy on the Board created by the removal of a Director under the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Bye-law may be filled by the affirmative vote of Shareholders holding at least a majority of the total combined voting power of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (after giving effect to any adjustments or eliminations of voting power under **Bye-laws 49-53** (inclusive)) at the meeting at which such Director is removed and, in the absence of such election or appointment, the Board may fill the vacancy. A Director so elected or appointed shall hold office until the next annual general meeting or until such Director’s office is otherwise vacated and shall serve within the same class of Directors as the predecessor. If term of such class extends beyond such next annual general meeting, then at such next annual general meeting the Shareholders shall elect a Director to serve the remaining term of such class.

^Other Vacancies on the Board

^The Board shall have the power from time to time and at any time to appoint any person as a Director to fill a vacancy on the Board occurring as the result of any of the events listed in paragraph (3) of this Bye-law 16 or from an increase in the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to **Bye-law 12**. The Board shall also have the power from time to time to fill any vacancy left unfilled at a general meeting. A Director appointed by the Board to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next annual general meeting or until such Director’s office is otherwise vacated. When filling the vacancy, the Board shall assign the Director to a class in keeping with the provisions of Bye-law 12(2). If term of such class extends beyond such next annual general meeting, then at such next annual general meeting the Shareholders shall elect a Director to serve the remaining term of such class.

^The Board may act notwithstanding any vacancy in its number but, if and so long as its number is reduced below the number fixed by these Bye-laws as the quorum necessary for the transaction of business at meetings of the Board, the continuing Directors or Director may act for the purpose of (i) summoning a general meeting of the Company, or (ii) preserving the assets of the Company.

^The office of a Director shall be vacated if the Director:

^^is or becomes bankrupt, or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors generally;

^^is or becomes disqualified, of unsound mind, or dies; or

The Board may from time to time require such evidence as it shall deem necessary or appropriate as to the due execution and continuing validity of any such standing proxy or authorization and the operation of any such standing proxy or authorization shall be deemed to be suspended until such time as the Board determines that it has received the requested evidence or other evidence satisfactory to it.

^Subject to paragraph (3) of this Bye-law the instrument appointing a proxy together with such other evidence as to its due execution as the Board may from time to time require shall be delivered at the registered office of the Company (or at such place or places as may be specified in the notice convening the meeting or in any notice of any adjournment or in any instrument of proxy sent out by the Company in relation to a meeting or, in any document sent therewith), prior to the holding of the relevant meeting or adjourned meeting at which the individual named in the instrument proposes to vote and in default the instrument of proxy shall not be treated as valid.

The instrument of proxy shall unless the contrary is stated therein be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates.

^A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or unsoundness of mind of the principal subsequent to giving the proxy but before the vote, or revocation of the instrument of proxy or of the authority under which it was executed.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the chairman of the meeting may accept such assurances as he or she thinks fit as to the right of any person to attend and vote at general meetings on behalf of a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other form of entity which is a Shareholder.

\centered **VOTES OF SHAREHOLDERS**

^General

Subject to the provisions of **Bye-laws 49-53** (inclusive) below, and subject to any rights and restrictions for the time being attached to any class or classes or series of shares, every Shareholder shall have one vote for each share carrying the right to vote on the matter in question of which he is the holder. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Bye-laws, all determinations in these Bye-laws that are made by or subject to a vote or approval of Shareholders shall be based upon the voting power of such Shareholders’ shares as determined pursuant to **Bye-laws 49-53** (inclusive).

^Adjustment of Voting Power

^The voting power of all shares is hereby adjusted (and shall be automatically adjusted in the future) to the extent necessary so that there is no [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder. The Board shall implement the foregoing in the manner provided herein provided, however, that the foregoing provision and the remainder of this **Bye-law 49** shall not apply in the event that one 

Shareholder owns greater than [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company determined without applying the voting power adjustments or eliminations under Bye-laws 49-53 (inclusive).

^The Board shall from time to time, including prior to any time at which a vote of Shareholders is taken, take all reasonable steps necessary to ascertain, including those specified in **Bye-law 53**, through communications with Shareholders or otherwise, whether there exists, or will exist at the time any vote of Shareholders is taken, a Tentative [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder.

^In the event that a Tentative [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder exists, the aggregate votes conferred by shares held by a Shareholder and treated as Controlled Shares of that Tentative [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder shall be reduced to the extent necessary such that the Controlled Shares of the Tentative [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder will constitute less than [[Percentage 1]]% of the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares. In applying the previous sentence where shares held by more than one Shareholder are treated as Controlled Shares of such Tentative [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder, the reduction in votes shall apply to such Shareholders in descending order according to their respective Attribution Percentages, provided that, in the event of a tie, the reduction shall apply pro rata to such Shareholders. The votes of Shareholders owning no shares treated as Controlled Shares of any Tentative [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder shall, in the aggregate, be increased by the same number of votes subject to reduction as described above provided however that no shares shall be conferred votes to the extent that doing so will cause any Shareholder to be treated as a [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder. Such increase shall be apportioned to all such Shareholders in proportion to their voting power at that time, provided that such increase shall be limited to the extent necessary to avoid causing any person to be a [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder. The adjustments of voting power described in this Bye-law shall apply repeatedly until there is no [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder. The Board of Directors may deviate from any of the principles described in this Bye-law and determine that shares held by a Shareholder shall carry different voting rights as it determines appropriate (1) to avoid the existence of any [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder or (2) to avoid adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences to the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, or any direct or indirect holder of shares or its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, in applying the provisions of **Bye-laws 49-53** (inclusive), a share may carry a fraction of a vote.

^Other Adjustments of Voting Power

In addition to the provisions of **Bye-law 49**, any shares shall not carry any right to vote to the extent that the Board of Directors determines, that it is necessary that such shares should not carry the right to vote in order to avoid adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences to the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, or any other direct or indirect holder of shares or its Affiliates, provided that no adjustment pursuant to this sentence shall cause any person to become a [[Percentage 1]]% U.S. Shareholder.

^Notice

Prior to the meeting on which Shareholders shall vote on any matter (or prior to any vote in the case of notification to Shareholders specified in item (3) of this Bye-law), the Board shall use best efforts to (1) retain the services of an internationally recognized accounting firm or organization with comparable professional capabilities in order to assist the Company in applying the principles of **Bye-laws 49-50** and (2) obtain from such firm or organization a statement describing the information obtained and procedures followed and setting forth the determinations made with respect to **Bye-laws 49-50**, and (3) notify in writing or orally each Shareholder of the voting power conferred by its shares determined in accordance with **Bye-laws 49-50**. For the avoidance of doubt, any failure by the Board to comply with any of the provisions of this Bye-law shall not invalidate any votes cast or the proceedings at the meeting.

^Board Determination Binding

Any determination by the Board as to any adjustments or eliminations of voting power of any shares made pursuant to Bye-laws 49-53 (inclusive) shall be final and binding and any vote taken based on such determination shall not be capable of being challenged solely on the basis of such determination.

^Requirement to Provide Information and Notice

^The Board shall have the authority to request from any direct or indirect holder of shares, and such holder of shares shall provide, such information as the Board may reasonably request for the purpose of determining whether any holder’s voting rights are to be adjusted. If such holder fails to respond to such a request, or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to such a request, the Board may determine in its discretion that such holder’s shares shall carry no voting rights in which case such shares shall not carry any voting rights until otherwise determined by the Board.

^Any direct or indirect holder of shares shall give notice to the Company within ten days following the date that such holder acquires actual knowledge that it is the direct or indirect holder of Controlled Shares of [[Percentage 1]]% or more of the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares of the Company (without giving effect to voting power adjustments or eliminations under Bye-laws 49-53 (inclusive).

^Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Shareholder shall be liable to any other Shareholder or the Company for any losses or damages resulting from such Shareholder’s failure to respond to, or submission of incomplete or inaccurate information in response to, a request under paragraph (1) or from such Shareholder’s failure to give notice under paragraph (2) of this Bye-law 53.

^Any information provided by any Shareholder to the Company pursuant to this Bye-law 53 or for purposes of making the analysis required by Bye-laws 49-50, shall be deemed “confidential information” (the “Confidential Information”) and shall be used by the Company solely for the purposes contemplated by such Bye-laws (except as may be required otherwise by applicable law or regulation).

^For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall be permitted to disclose to the Shareholders and others the relative voting percentages of all Shareholders after application of Bye-laws 49-53 (inclusive). At the written request of a Shareholder, the Confidential Information of such Shareholder shall be destroyed or returned to such Shareholder after the later to occur of (i) such Shareholder no longer being a Shareholder or (ii) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any Confidential Information obtained for purposes of engaging in any tax-related analysis.

The Board shall cause the Company’s corporate representative or proxy to vote the Company’s shares in the subsidiary pro rata to the votes received at the general meeting of the Company, with votes for or against the directing resolution being taken, respectively, as an instruction for the Company’s corporate representative or proxy to vote the appropriate proportion of its shares for and the appropriate proportion of its shares against the resolution proposed by the subsidiary. The Board shall have authority to resolve any ambiguity.

^Bye-laws or Articles of Association of Certain Subsidiaries

The Board in its discretion shall require that the Bye-laws or Articles of Association or similar organizational documents of each subsidiary of the Company, organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States of America, other than any non-U.S. subsidiary that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a U.S. Person, shall contain provisions substantially similar to **Bye-laws 49-53** (inclusive). The Company shall enter into agreements, as and when determined by the Board, with each such subsidiary, only if and to the extent reasonably necessary and permitted under applicable law, to effectuate or implement this Bye-law.

^Without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any existing shares or class or series of shares, the share capital of the Company shall consist of at least one class of common shares that carry voting rights. The holders of shares shall, subject to the provisions of these Bye-laws and unless shares held are not common shares and are classes or series of shares with additional or other rights and restrictions:

^^be entitled to one vote per share but subject to any adjustments or eliminations of voting power under Bye-laws 49-53 (inclusive);

^^be entitled to such dividends as the Board may from time to time declare;

^^in the event of a winding-up or dissolution of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or for the purpose of a reorganization or otherwise or upon any distribution of capital, be entitled to the surplus assets of the Company; and

^^generally be entitled to enjoy all of the rights attaching to shares.

^All the rights attaching to a Treasury Share shall be suspended and shall not be exercised by the Company while it holds such Treasury Share and, shall except where required by the Act, all Treasury Shares shall be excluded from the calculation of any percentage or fraction of the share capital, or shares, of the Company. Once a Treasury Share ceases to be held by the Company it will no longer be treated as a Treasury Share and the rights allocated to such share shall be restored on a prospective basis.

^Power to Issue Shares

^Subject to the restrictions, if any that are provided for in these Bye-laws from time to time and without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any existing shares or class or series of shares, the Board shall have power to issue any unissued shares of the Company on such terms and conditions and with such rights and restrictions as it may determine and any shares or class or series of shares may be issued with such preferred, deferred, redemption, repurchase or other special rights or such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting (including, without limitation, shares which do not carry any voting rights), return of capital or otherwise as the Board may determine. Further, the Board may create and issue shares of a new class or series or of any existing class or series of shares and the Board may generally exercise the powers of the Company namely to (a) divide its shares into several classes or series and attach thereto respectively any preferential, deferred, qualified or special rights, privileges or conditions; (b) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than its existing shares; (c) subdivide its shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by the Memorandum of Association of the Company, provided however that in the subdivision the proportion between the amount paid and the amount, if any, unpaid on each reduced share shall be the same as it was in the case of a share from which the reduced share is derived; (d) make provision for the issue and allotment of shares which do not carry any voting rights; and (e) cancel shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution of the Board in that behalf, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person, and diminish the amount of the Company’s share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled, without the need of any specific approval of the Shareholders as might otherwise be required by such sections of the Act. The Board may also issue options, warrants or other rights to purchase or acquire shares or, subject to the Act, securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares (including, without limitation, any employee benefit plan providing for the issue of shares or options or rights in respect thereof) on such terms, conditions and other provisions as are fixed by the Board, including, without limiting the generality of this authority, conditions that preclude or limit any person or persons owning or offering to acquire a specified number or percentage of the outstanding shares, option rights, securities having conversion or option rights, or obligations of the Company or transferee of the person or persons from exercising, converting, transferring or receiving the shares, option rights, securities having conversion or option rights, or obligations and, at such times, for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as it may determine. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board may create and issue shares including, but not limited to, series of preferred shares (which may or may not be separate classes of preferred shares), at such times, for such consideration and on such terms and conditions, with similar or different rights or restrictions as any other class or series and to establish from time to time the number of preferred shares to be included in each such class or series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences, voting rights, dividend rights, redemption, repurchase provisions, and other rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as it may determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of these Bye-laws (except for the immediately following sentence), the Company shall not issue any shares or grant options or warrants in any manner that the Board determines may result in a non-de minimis adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequence to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any direct or indirect holder of shares or its Affiliates. The immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to any issuance of shares or to grants of options or warrants to a person acting as an underwriter in the ordinary course of its business, purchasing such shares, options or warrants pursuant to a purchase agreement to which the Company is a party, for resale.

^The Board shall, in connection with the issue of any share, have the power to authorize the Company to pay such commission and brokerage as may be permitted by law.

^Except as authorized by the Board and permitted by applicable law, the Company shall not give, whether directly or indirectly, whether by means of loan, guarantee, provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person of or for any shares in the Company, but nothing in this Bye-law shall prohibit transactions permitted under the Act.

^The Company may from time to time do any one or more of the following things:

^^make arrangements on the issue of shares for a difference between the Shareholders in the amounts and times of payments of calls on their shares;

^^accept from any Shareholder the whole or a part of the amount remaining unpaid on any shares held by him, although no part of that amount has been called up;

^^pay dividends in proportion to the amount paid up on each share where a larger amount is paid up on some shares than on others; and

^^issue its shares in fractional denominations and deal with such fractions to the same extent as its whole shares and shares in fractional denominations shall have in proportion to the respective fractions represented thereby all of the rights of whole shares including (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing) the right to vote, to receive dividends and distributions and to participate in a winding up.

^Variation of Rights, Alteration of Share Capital and Purchase of Shares of the Company

^Subject to the provisions of the Act, any preference or preferred shares may be issued or converted into shares that, at a determinable date or at the option of the Company, are liable to be redeemed on such terms and in such manner as, before the issue or conversion, may be determined by the Board.

^If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes or series of shares, the rights attached to any class or series (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class or series) may, whether or not the Company is being wound-up, be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of three-fourths of the issued shares of that class or series or with the sanction of a resolution passed by a majority of the votes cast at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class or series. The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class or series issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class or series, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith or having less rights. Further, the rights attaching to the common shares shall be deemed not to be varied by the creation or issue of any share ranking in priority for payment of a dividend or with any other rights more favorable than those conferred by the common shares.

^The Company may from time to time by resolution of the Shareholders or pursuant to Bye-law 57 (as applicable) change the currency denomination of, increase, alter, divide, consolidate, subdivide, diminish or reduce its share capital in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Where, on any change or reduction of share capital as aforesaid, fractions of shares or some other difficulty would arise, the Board may deal with or resolve the same in such manner as it thinks fit, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the issue to Shareholders, as appropriate, of fractions of shares and/or arranging for the sale or transfer of the fractions of shares of Shareholders.

^The Company may from time to time purchase (or repurchase) its own shares in accordance with the provisions of the Act on such terms as the Board shall think fit.

^Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not vary the rights attaching to any class or series of shares, change or reduce its share capital or purchase (or repurchase) its own shares if the Board, after taking into account, among other things, adjustments or eliminations of voting power contained in Bye-laws 49-53 (inclusive), determines that any non-de minimis adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, or any direct or indirect holder of shares or its Affiliates would result from such action.

^Registered Holder of Shares

^The Company shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any share as the absolute owner thereof and accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such share on the part of any other person.

^Any dividend, interest or other moneys payable in cash in respect of shares may be paid by check or draft sent through the post directed to the Shareholder at such Shareholder’s address in the Register of Shareholders or, in the case of joint holders, to such address of the holder first named in the Register of Shareholders, or to such person and to such address as the holder or joint holders may in writing direct. If two or more persons are registered as joint holders of any shares, any one can give an effectual receipt for any dividend paid in respect of such shares.

^Death of a Joint Holder

Where two or more persons are registered as joint holders of a share or shares, then in the event of the death of any joint holder or holders, the remaining joint holder or holders shall be absolutely entitled to the said share or shares and the Company shall recognize no claim in respect of the estate of any joint holder except in the case of the last survivor of such joint holders.

^Share Certificates

^Every Shareholder shall be entitled to a certificate under the common seal of the Company (or a facsimile thereof) or bearing the signature (or a facsimile thereof) of a Director or the Secretary or a person expressly authorized to sign specifying the number and, where appropriate, the class or series of shares held by such Shareholder and whether the same are fully paid up and, if not, how much has been paid thereon. The Board may determine, either generally or in a particular case, that any or all signatures on certificates may be printed thereon or affixed by mechanical means. Notwithstanding Bye-law 90, the Board may determine that a share certificate need not be signed on behalf of the Company or that the seal of the Company need not be attested.

^The Company shall be under no obligation to complete and deliver a share certificate unless specifically called upon to do so by the person to whom such shares have been allotted.

^If any such certificate shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Board to have been worn out, lost, mislaid or destroyed, the Board may cause a new certificate to be issued and request an indemnity for the lost certificate if it sees fit.

^Calls on Shares

^The Board may from time to time make such calls as it thinks fit upon the Shareholders in respect of any monies unpaid on the shares allotted to or held by such Shareholders and, if a call is not paid on or before the day appointed for payment thereof, the Shareholder may, at the discretion of the Board, be liable to pay the Company interest on the amount of such call at such rate as the Board may determine, from the date when such call was payable up to the actual date of payment. The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.

^The Board may, on the issue of shares, differentiate between the holders as to the amount of calls to be paid and the times of payment of such calls.

^Any sum which by the terms of allotment of a share becomes payable upon issue or at any fixed date, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, shall for all the purposes of these Bye-laws be deemed to be a call duly made and payable, on the date on which, by the terms of issue, the same becomes payable, and in case of non-payment all the relevant provisions of these Bye-laws as to payment of interest, costs, charges and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise shall apply as if such sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

^The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.

^The Company may accept from any Shareholder the whole or a part of the amount remaining unpaid on any shares held by him, although no part of that amount has been called up.

^Forfeiture of Shares

^If any Shareholder fails to pay, on the day appointed for payment thereof, any call in respect of any share allotted to or held by such Shareholder, the Board may, at any time thereafter during such time as the call remains unpaid, direct the Secretary to forward to such Shareholder a notice in the form, or as near thereto as circumstances admit, of Form “A” in the Schedule hereto.

^If the requirements of such notice are not complied with, any such share may at any time thereafter before the payment of such call and the interest due in respect thereof be forfeited by a resolution of the Board to that effect, and such share shall thereupon become the property of the Company and may be disposed of as the Board shall determine.

^A Shareholder whose share or shares have been forfeited as aforesaid shall, notwithstanding such forfeiture, be liable to pay to the Company all calls owing on such share or shares at the time of the forfeiture and all interest due thereon.

^The Board may accept the surrender of any shares which it is in a position to forfeit on such terms and conditions as may be agreed. Subject to those terms and conditions, a surrendered share shall be treated as if it has been forfeited.

^Repurchase of Shares

^If the Board determine that share ownership by any person may result in a non-de minimis adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences to the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, or any other direct or indirect holder of shares or its Affiliates (including if such consequence arises as a result of any such U.S. Person owning Controlled Shares of [[Percentage 1]]% or more of the value of the Company or the voting shares of the Company (after giving effect to any adjustments or eliminations of voting power pursuant to the provisions of Bye-laws 49-53 (inclusive)), the Company will have the option but not the obligation to purchase or repurchase or assign to a third party the right to purchase the minimum number of shares held by such person which is necessary to eliminate such non-de minimis adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequence at a price determined in the discretion of the Board to represent such shares’ Fair Market Value;

^“Fair Market Value” means, with respect to a repurchase of any shares of the Company in accordance with paragraph (1) of this Bye-law 64, (a) if such shares are listed on a securities exchange (or quoted in a securities quotation system), the average closing sale price of such shares on such exchange (or in such quotation system), or, if such shares are listed on (or quoted in) more than one exchange (or quotation system), the average closing sale price of the shares on the principal securities exchange (or quotation system) on which such shares are then traded, or, if such shares are not then listed on a securities exchange (or quotation system) but are traded in the over-the-counter market, the average of the latest bid and asked quotations for such shares in such market, in each case for the last eight (8) trading days immediately preceding the day on which notice of the repurchase of such shares is sent pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Bye-law 64, or (b) (i) with respect to a repurchase, if no such closing sales prices or quotations are available because such shares are not publicly traded or otherwise, the fair value of such shares as determined by the Board; provided, that the calculation of the Fair Market Value of the shares (A) shall not include any discount relating to (x) the absence of a public trading market for, or any transfer restrictions on, such shares, or (y) the fact that such shares being repurchased represent a minority of the issued and outstanding shares, and (B) shall be final and the fees and expenses stemming from such calculation shall be borne by the Company or its assignee, as the case may be. If a Shareholder disagrees with the price so determined by the Board and notifies the Company of such disagreement within ten (10) days after notice of such determination,the Fair Market Value per share and the liquidity discount, if any, will be determined by an independent appraiser retained by the Company at its expense and reasonably acceptable to such Shareholder.

\centered **REGISTER OF SHAREHOLDERS**

The Board shall cause to be kept in one or more books a Register of Shareholders and shall enter therein the particulars required by the Act.

\centered **TRANSFER OF SHARES**

^Instrument of Transfer

^Subject to paragraph (5) of Bye-law 69, an instrument of transfer shall be in the form or as near thereto as circumstances admit of Form “B” in the Schedule hereto or in such other common form as the Board may accept including, without limitation, customary forms of the transfer agent of the Company or those of the New York Stock Exchange (or such other stock exchange as may serve as the primary stock exchange for the Company’s common shares). Such instrument of transfer shall be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and transferee provided that, in the case of a fully paid share, the Board may accept the instrument signed by or on behalf of the transferor alone. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of such share until the same has been transferred to the transferee in the Register of Shareholders.

^The Board may refuse to recognize any instrument of transfer unless it is accompanied by the certificate in respect of the shares to which it relates and by such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer.

^Restrictions on Transfer

^The Board may decline to approve or register any transfer of shares if it appears to the Board, after taking into account, among other things, the adjustments or eliminations of voting power contained in Bye-laws 49-53 (inclusive), that any non-de minimis adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, or any other direct or indirect holder of shares or its Affiliates would result from such transfer (including if such consequence arises as a result of any such U.S. Person owning Controlled Shares of [[Percentage 1]]% of more of the value of the Company or the voting shares of the Company (after giving effect to any adjustments or eliminations of voting power pursuant to the provisions of **Bye-laws 49-53** (inclusive)). The Board shall have the authority to request from any holder of shares, and such holder of shares shall provide, such information as the Board may reasonably request for the purpose of determining whether any transfer should be permitted.

^Subject to any applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other applicable stock exchange), the Board (i) may decline to approve or to register any transfer of any share if a written opinion from counsel acceptable to the Company shall not have been obtained to the effect that registration of such shares under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is not required and (ii) shall decline to approve or to register any transfer of any share if the transferee shall not have been approved by applicable governmental authorities if such approval is required or if not in compliance with applicable consent, authorization or permission of any governmental body or agency in Bermuda.

^If the Board refuses to register a transfer of any share, the Secretary shall send or procure that there shall be sent, within one month after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company, send to the transferor and transferee notice of the refusal.

^The registration of transfers may be suspended at such times and for such periods as the Board may, from time to time determine, provided always that such registration shall not be suspended for more than 45 days in any year.

^Shares may be transferred without a written instrument if transferred by an appointed agent or otherwise in accordance with the Act.

^The restrictions on transfer of shares contained in this Bye-law 69 shall not apply to (a) any transfer that was approved by the Board prior to these Bye-laws coming into effect (as indicated in the resolutions adopting these Bye-laws), or (b) any transfer in connection with any matter approved by the Board prior to these Bye-laws coming into effect, including, without limitation, the initial public offering of the Company’s shares; provided, however, any such transfer must be in compliance with applicable consent, authorization or permission of Bermuda Monetary Authority.

^Transfers by Joint Holders

The joint holders of any share or shares may transfer such share or shares to one or more of such joint holders, and the surviving holder or holders of any share or shares previously held by them jointly with a deceased Shareholder may transfer any such share to the executors or administrators of such deceased Shareholder.

\centered **TRANSMISSION OF SHARES**

^Representative of Deceased Shareholder

In the case of the death of a Shareholder, the survivor or survivors where the deceased Shareholder was a joint holder, and the legal personal representatives of the deceased Shareholder where the deceased Shareholder was a sole holder, shall be the only persons recognized by the Company as having any title to the deceased Shareholder’s interest in the shares. Nothing herein contained shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by such deceased Shareholder with other persons. Subject to the provisions of the Act, for the purpose of this Bye-law, legal personal representative means the executor or administrator of a deceased Shareholder or such other person as the Board may decide as being properly authorized to deal with the shares of a deceased Shareholder.

^Registration on Death or Bankruptcy

Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may be registered as a Shareholder upon such evidence as the Board may deem sufficient or may elect to nominate some person to be registered as a transferee of such share, and in such case the person becoming entitled shall execute in favor of such nominee an instrument of transfer in the form, or as near thereto as circumstances admit, of Form “C” in the Schedule hereto or in such customary form stipulated by the transfer agent of the Company or the New York Stock Exchange or such other stock exchange as may serve as the primary stock exchange for the Company’s common shares (as appropriate). On the presentation thereof to the Board, accompanied by such evidence as the Board may require to prove the title of the transferor, the transferee shall be registered as a Shareholder but the Board shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as it would have had in the case of a transfer of the share by that Shareholder before such Shareholder’s death or bankruptcy, as the case may be.

\centered **DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS**

^Declaration of Dividends by the Board

^The Board may, subject to these Bye-laws and in accordance with the Act, declare a dividend to be paid to the Shareholders, in proportion to the number of shares held by them, and such dividend may be paid in cash or wholly or partly in specie in which case the Board may fix the value for distribution in specie of any assets.

The Board may deduct from the dividends or distributions payable to any Shareholder all monies due from such Shareholder to the Company on account of calls or otherwise.

^Issue of Bonus Shares

^The Board may resolve to capitalize any part of the amount for the time being standing to the credit of any of the Company’s share premium or other reserve accounts or to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution by applying such sum in paying up unissued shares to be allotted as fully paid bonus shares pro rata to the Shareholders.

^The Company may capitalize any sum standing to the credit of a reserve account or sums otherwise available for dividend or distribution by applying such amounts in paying up in full partly paid or nil paid shares of those Shareholders who would have been entitled to such sums if they were distributed by way of dividend or distribution.
