^^In consideration of the rents, covenants, and agreements set forth herein and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Lessor hereby leases to Lessees and Lessees hereby lease from Lessor, the Premises for a term commencing on the effective date hereof (the “**Commencement Date**”) and ending at midnight on the date which is fifty (50) years after the date hereof, and after such date the term of this Lease shall be automatically renewed for a maximum of four (4) successive ten-year periods thereafter (the “**Term**”); provided, however, Lessees may terminate this Lease at the end of such initial period or any subsequent ten-year period by delivering written notice to Lessor, on or before 180 days prior to the end of any such period, that Lessees have elected to terminate this Lease. 

^^At Lessees’ option, Lessees may terminate this Lease, by providing written notice to Lessor on or before 180 days prior to the desired termination date if Lessees cease to operate the Relevant Assets and Additional Improvements or ceases its business operations. In the event of such termination pursuant to this Section 2.1(b), Lessor shall retain one half of the remaining Rent (as defined below) for the then current 12-month rental period as set forth in Section 2.3 below as its sole and exclusive remedy for such early termination and shall refund to Lessees the remaining Rent. 

^^**Access**.  

^^Lessor hereby grants to Lessees and their respective Affiliates, agents, employees and contractors (collectively, “**Lessees’ Parties**”) free of charge, an irrevocable, non-exclusive right of access to and use of those portions of the Refinery Site that are reasonably necessary for access to and/or the operation of the Relevant Assets and Additional Improvements by Lessees as a stand-alone enterprise, all so long as such access and use by any of Lessees’ Parties does not unreasonably interfere in any material respect with Lessor’s operations at the Refinery Site and complies with Lessor’s rules, norms and procedures governing safety and security at the Refinery Site. The facilities on the Refinery Site that are subject to the access and use rights provided under this Section, are referred to herein as the “**Shared Access Facilities**”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 2.2(a) shall relate only to access and use of the Shared Access Facilities, and the Site Services Agreement shall cover all services that are to be provided by Lessor under the terms of the Site Services Agreement. 

^^Lessor hereby retains for itself and its Affiliates, agents, employees and contractors (collectively, “**Lessor’s Parties**”), the right of access to all of the Premises and the Relevant Assets (i) to determine whether the conditions and covenants contained in this Lease are being kept and performed, (ii) to comply with Environmental Laws, and (iii) to inspect, maintain, repair, improve and operate the SUMF Assets and the Shared Access Facilities and any 

^^^^^ 
assets of Lessor located on the Premises or to install or construct any structures or equipment necessary for the maintenance, operation or improvement of any such assets or the installation, construction or maintenance of any Connection Facilities, all so long as such access by Lessor’s Parties does not unreasonably interfere in any material respect with Lessees’ operations on the Premises and complies with Lessees’ rules, norms and procedures governing safety and security at the Premises. 

^^**Rent**. As rental for the Premises during the Term, Lessees agree to pay to Lessor for each 12-month period of the Term One Hundred and 00/100 ($100.00) (the “**Rent**”) on or before the 1st day of each 12-month period, the first such payment being due within 30 days of the Commencement Date of the Term. 

^^**Place of Payment**. All Rent shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America at Lessor’s address set forth in Section 11.7. 

^^**Net Lease**. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided in this Lease and in the Ancillary Agreements, this is a net lease and Lessor shall not at any time be required to pay any utility charges or any costs associated with the maintenance, repair, alteration or improvement of the Premises or to provide any services or do any act or thing with respect to the Premises or any part thereof or any appurtenances thereto, and the Rent reserved herein shall be paid without any claim on the part of Lessees for diminution, setoff or abatement and nothing shall suspend, abate or reduce any Rent to be paid hereunder, except as expressly provided herein. 

**CONDUCT OF BUSINESS**  

^^**Use of Premises**. Lessees shall have the right to use the Premises for the purpose of owning, operating, maintaining, repairing, replacing, improving, and expanding the Relevant Assets and the Additional Improvements and for any other lawful purpose associated with the operation and ownership of the Relevant Assets and the Additional Improvements. 

^^**Waste**. Subject to the obligations of Lessor under the Ancillary Agreements, Lessees shall not commit, or suffer to be committed, any waste to the Premises, ordinary wear and tear or casualty excepted. 

^^**Governmental Regulations**. Subject to the obligations of Lessor to Lessees under this Lease and the Ancillary Agreements including the indemnity provisions contained in the Ancillary Agreements, each Lessee shall, at such Lessee’s sole cost and expense, at all times comply with all applicable requirements (including requirements under Environmental Laws) of all Governmental Authorities now in force, or which may hereafter be in force, pertaining to the Premises, and shall faithfully observe all Laws now in force or which may hereafter be in force pertaining to the Premises or the use, maintenance or operation thereof. Each Lessee shall give prompt written notice to Lessor of such Lessee’s receipt from time to time of any notice of non-compliance, order or other directive from any court or other Governmental Authority under Environmental Laws relating to the Premises. If Lessor reasonably believes at any time that any Lessee is not complying with all applicable legal requirements (including requirements under 

^^^^^ 
Environmental Laws) with respect to the Relevant Assets and Additional Improvements, it will provide reasonable notice to Lessees of such condition. If such Lessee fails to take appropriate action to cause such assets to comply with applicable Laws or take other actions required under applicable Laws within 30 days of Lessor’s reasonable notice, Lessor may, without further notice to such Lessee, take such actions for such Lessee’s account. Within 30 days following the date Lessor delivers to such Lessee evidence of payment for those actions by Lessor reasonably necessary to cause the Relevant Assets and Additional Improvements to achieve compliance with applicable Laws because of Lessees’ failure to do so, such Lessee shall reimburse Lessor all amounts paid by Lessor on such Lessee’s behalf. 

^^**Air Quality Permits**. Notwithstanding Lessees’ obligation to maintain and operate the Relevant Assets and Additional Improvements and comply with applicable Laws, Lessor and Lessees acknowledge that Lessor may, as required by any applicable Governmental Authorities, maintain air quality permits in its name. Consequently and also for the ease of administration, Lessor may maintain in its name the air quality permits and other authorizations applicable to all, or part of, the Relevant Assets and Additional Improvements and may be responsible for making any reports or other notifications to Governmental Authorities pursuant to such permits or Laws. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, nothing in this Lease shall reduce Lessees’ obligations under Laws with respect to the Relevant Assets and Additional Improvements. 

^^**Utilities**. Lessor shall provide all utilities (electricity, natural gas, water, steam, etc.) necessary for Lessees’ operation of the Relevant Assets and the Additional Improvements in accordance with the provisions of the Site Services Agreement. 

**ALTERATIONS, ADDITIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS** 

Subject to the provisions of this Article IV, Lessees may make any alterations, additions, improvements or other changes to the Premises and the Relevant Assets as may be necessary or useful in connection with the operation of the Relevant Assets (collectively, the “**Additional Improvements**”). If such Additional Improvements require alterations, additions or improvements to the Premises or any of the Shared Access Facilities, Lessees shall notify Lessor in writing in advance and the parties shall negotiate in good faith any increase to the fees paid by Lessees under the Site Services Agreement by Lessees or otherwise provide for reimbursement of any material increase in cost (if any) to Lessor under the Site Services Agreement that results from any modifications to the Premises or the Shared Access Facilities necessary to accommodate the Additional Improvements, or as otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. Any alteration, addition, improvement or other change to the Premises, Relevant Assets or Additional Improvements (and, if agreed by Lessees and Lessor, to the Shared Access Facilities) by Lessees shall be made in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable Laws. The Relevant Assets and all Additional Improvements shall remain the property of Lessees and shall be removed by Lessees within one (1) year after termination of this Lease (provided that such can be removed by Lessees without unreasonable damage or harm to the Premises) or, at Lessees’ option exercisable by notice to Lessor, surrendered to Lessor upon the termination of this Lease. Lessees shall not have the right or power to create or permit any lien of any kind or character on the Premises by reason of repair or construction or other work. In the event any 

^^^^^ 
such lien is filed against the Premises, Lessees shall cause such lien to be discharged or bonded within thirty (30) days of the date of filing thereof. 

**MAINTENANCE OF PREMISES**  

^^**Maintenance by Lessees**. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article V and in Article VII or elsewhere in this Lease and subject to the obligations of Lessor and Lessees under the Ancillary Agreements, including any indemnity provisions contained in the Ancillary Agreements, Lessees shall at their sole cost, risk and expense at all times keep the Premises and Additional Improvements (to the extent such Additional Improvements are located on the Shared Access Facilities) in good order and repair and make all necessary repairs thereto, structural and nonstructural, ordinary and extraordinary, and unforeseen and foreseen. When used in this Section 5.1, the term “repairs” shall include all necessary replacements, renewal, alterations and additions. All repairs made by Lessees shall be made in accordance with normal and customary practices in the industry, in a good and workmanlike manner, and in accordance with all applicable Laws. 

^^**Operation of Premises**. Subject to the obligations of Lessor and Lessees in this Lease and under the Ancillary Agreements, including any indemnity provisions contained in the Ancillary Agreements, Lessees covenant and agree to operate the Relevant Assets and Additional Improvements located on the Premises in accordance with normal and customary practices in the industry and all applicable Laws and other requirements of applicable Governmental Authorities now in force, or which may hereafter be in force, pertaining to the Premises or the use or operation thereof. 

^^**Surrender of Premises**. Lessees shall at the expiration of the Term or at any earlier termination of this Lease, surrender the Premises to Lessor in as good condition as it received the same, ordinary wear and tear, and limitations permitted by Article VII excepted and in accordance with the provisions of Article IV. 

^^**Release of Hazardous Substances**. Lessees shall give prompt notice to Lessor of any release of any Hazardous Substances on or at the Premises not in compliance with Environmental Laws that occur during the Term. Lessor shall immediately take all steps necessary to contain or remediate (or both) any such release and provide any governmental notifications required by Law. If Lessor believes at any time that any Lessee is failing to contain or remediate in compliance with all applicable Laws (including Environmental Laws) any release arising from such Lessee’s operation of the Relevant Assets or Additional Improvements or such Lessee’s failure to comply with its obligations pursuant to this Lease, Lessor will provide reasonable notice to Lessees of such failure. If such Lessee fails to take appropriate action to contain or remediate such a release or take other actions required under applicable Laws or this Lease within 30 days of Lessor’s reasonable notice, Lessor may, without further notice to Lessees, take such actions for such Lessee’s account. Within 30 days following the date Lessor delivers to Lessees evidence of payment for those actions by Lessor reasonably necessary to contain or remediate a release or otherwise achieve compliance with applicable Laws or this Lease because of any Lessee’s failure to do so, such Lessee shall reimburse Lessor all amounts paid by Lessor on such Lessee’s behalf. 

^^^^^ 
**TAXES, ASSESSMENTS**  

^^**Lessees’ Obligation to Pay**. Lessees shall pay during the Term, all federal, state and local real and personal property ad valorem taxes, assessments, and other governmental charges, general and special, ordinary and extraordinary, including assessments for public improvements or benefits assessed against the Premises, or improvements situated thereon, including the Relevant Assets and all Additional Improvements (but excluding any Shared Access Facilities and any SUMF Assets) for the period after the Commencement Date, that are payable to any lawful authority assessed against or with respect to the Premises or the use or operation thereof during the Term, including any federal, state or local income, gross receipts, withholding, franchise, excise, sales, use, value added, recording, transfer or stamp tax, levy, duty, charge or withholding of any kind imposed or assessed by any federal, state or local government, agency or authority, together with any addition to tax, penalty, fine or interest thereon, other than state or U.S. federal income tax imposed upon the taxable income of Lessor and any franchise taxes imposed upon Lessor (such taxes and assessments being hereinafter called “**Taxes**”). In the event that Lessees fail to pay their share of such Taxes in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.1 prior to the time the same become delinquent, Lessor may pay the same and Lessees shall reimburse Lessor all amounts paid by Lessor on Lessees’ behalf within 30 days following the date Lessor delivers to Lessees evidence of such payment. 

^^**Manner of Payment**. Upon notice by Lessees to Lessor, Lessor and Lessees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Premises and the Relevant Assets (including all Additional Improvements but excluding Shared Access Facilities and any SUMF Assets) to be separately assessed for purposes of Taxes as soon as reasonably practicable following the Commencement Date (to the extent allowed by applicable Law). During the Term but subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, Lessees shall pay all Taxes assessed directly against the Premises, the Relevant Assets and the Additional Improvements (but excluding the Shared Access Facilities and any SUMF Assets) directly to the applicable taxing authority prior to delinquency and shall promptly thereafter provide Lessor with evidence of such payment. Until such time as Lessor and Lessees can cause the Premises, the Relevant Assets and the Additional Improvements (but excluding the Shared Access Facilities and any SUMF Assets) to be separately assessed as provided above, Lessees shall reimburse Lessor, upon request, for any such Taxes paid by Lessor to the applicable taxing authorities (such reimbursement to be based upon the mutual agreement of the Lessor and Lessees as to the portion of such Taxes attributable to the Premises, the Relevant Assets and the Additional Improvements), subject to the terms of Section 6.1. The certificate issued or given by the appropriate officials authorized or designated by law to issue or give the same or to receive payment of such Taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the existence, payment, nonpayment and amount of such Taxes. Lessees may contest the validity or amount of any such Taxes or the valuation of the Premises and/or the Relevant Assets and the Additional Improvements (to the extent any of the foregoing may be separately issued), at Lessees’ sole cost and expense, by appropriate proceedings, diligently conducted in good faith in accordance with applicable Law. If Lessees contest such items then Lessor shall cooperate with Lessees in any such contesting of the validity or amount of any such Taxes or the valuation of the Premises and/or the Relevant Assets and the Additional Improvements.

**EMINENT DOMAIN; CASUALTY; INSURANCE** 

^^**Total Condemnation of Premises**. If the whole of the Premises are acquired or condemned by eminent domain for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, then this Lease shall terminate as of the date title vests in any public agency. All rentals and other charges owing hereunder shall be prorated as of such date. 

^^**Partial Condemnation**. If any part of the Premises is acquired or condemned as set forth in Section 7.1, and if in Lessees’ reasonable opinion such partial taking or condemnation renders the Premises unsuitable for the business of Lessees, then this Lease shall terminate at Lessees’ election as of the date title vests in any public agency, provided Lessees deliver to Lessor written notice of such election to terminate within 60 days following the date title vests in such public agency.

Lessees shall have the right to claim and recover from the condemning authority, but not from Lessor, such compensation as may be separately awarded or recoverable by any Lessee in such Lessee’s own right on account of any and all damage to the Relevant Assets, the Additional Improvements and/or such Lessee’s business by reason of the condemnation, including loss of value of any unexpired portion of the Term, and for or on account of any cost or loss to which such Lessee might be put in removing such Lessee’s personal property, fixtures, leasehold improvements and equipment, including the Relevant Assets and the Additional Improvements, from the Premises. 

During any periods of time during which the Relevant Assets and/or Additional Improvements are destroyed, damaged, or are being restored or reconstructed (each a “Casualty Event”) under the terms of this Section, Rent hereunder shall be abated in the proportion that Lessees’ use thereof is impacted by such Casualty Event, on the condition that Lessees take commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the disruption to its business caused by such Casualty Event.

^^The occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event. 

^^**Lessor’s Remedies**.  

^^In the event of any such material default under or material breach of the terms of this Lease by any Lessee, Lessor may, at Lessor’s option, at any time thereafter that such default or breach remains uncured, without further notice or demand, terminate this Lease and Lessees’ right to possession of the Premises and forthwith repossess the Premises by any lawful means in which event Lessees shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Lessor; and any such action on the part of Lessor shall be in addition to any other remedy that may be available to Lessor for arrears of Rent or breach of contract, or otherwise, including the right of setoff. 

^^If, by the terms of this Lease, any Lessee is required to do or perform any act or to pay any sum to a third party, and fails or refuses to do so, Lessor, after 30 days written 

^^^^^ 
notice to such Lessee, without waiving any other right or remedy hereunder for such default, may do or perform such act, at such Lessee’s expense, or pay such sum for and on behalf of such Lessee, and the amounts so expended by Lessor shall be repayable on demand, and bear interest from the date expended by Lessor until paid at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) an interest rate equal to the “Prime Rate” as published in *The Wall Street Journal*, Southwest Edition, in its listing of “Money Rates” plus two percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) or (ii) the maximum non-usurious rate of interest permitted to be charged such Lessee under applicable Law (the “**Post-Maturity Rate**”).

Lessees may, at Lessees’ option, deduct any such amounts so expended by Lessees from the Rent and any other amounts owed hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement and any such action on the part of Lessees shall be in addition to any other remedy that may be available to Lessees for default or breach of contract, or otherwise, including the right of setoff. 

**INDEMNITY**  

^^**Indemnification by Lessor**. Lessor agrees to indemnify, defend, protect, save and keep harmless Lessees and their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, unitholders, members, partners, managers, agents, employees, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the “**Lessee Indemnified Parties**”) from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, demands, claims (including claims involving strict or absolute liability in tort), actions, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of any kind and nature whatsoever (collectively, the “**Claims**”) which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any of the Lessee Indemnified Parties, in any way relating to or arising out of (a) any failure to perform any 

^^^^^ 
covenant or agreement made or undertaken by Lessor in this Lease, or (b) the exercise of Lessor’s rights and obligations under Section 2.2(b); provided, however, Lessor shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Lessee Indemnified Parties for any such Claim under clauses (a) or (b) to the extent resulting from or arising out of the willful misconduct or negligence (standard negligence or gross negligence) of any of the Lessee Indemnified Parties. To the extent that the Lessee Indemnified Parties in fact receive full indemnification payments from Lessor under the indemnification provisions of this Section 10.1, Lessor shall be subrogated to the Lessee Indemnified Parties’ rights with respect to the transaction or event requiring or giving rise to such indemnity. **NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED IN THIS LEASE TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL LESSOR BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR ON ACCOUNT OF THIS LEASE, EXCEPT THOSE PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES FOR WHICH LESSOR WOULD BE LIABLE UNDER THIS SECTION**.

Nothing in this Section 11.1 shall be construed to waive the conditions elsewhere contained in this Lease applicable to assignment or subletting of the Premises by Lessees. 

^^**Severability; Joint and Several Liability**.

The acceptance of Rent hereunder by Lessor shall not be a waiver of any preceding breach by 

^^^^^ 
any Lessee of any provision hereof, other than the failure of such Lessee to pay the particular Rent so accepted, regardless of Lessor’s knowledge of such preceding breach at the time of acceptance of such Rent. 

^^**No Partnership**. The relationship between Lessor and Lessees at all times shall remain solely that of landlord and tenant and shall not be deemed a partnership or joint venture. 

^^**No Third Party Beneficiaries**. Subject to the provisions of Article X and Section 11.14 hereof, this Lease inures to the sole and exclusive benefit of Lessor and Lessees, their respective Affiliates, successors, legal representatives, sublessees and assigns, and confers no benefit on any third party. 

^^**Waiver of Landlord’s Lien**. To the extent permitted by Law, Lessor hereby expressly waives any and all liens (constitutional, statutory, contractual or otherwise) upon Lessees’ personal property now or hereafter installed or placed in or on the Premises, which otherwise might exist to secure payment of the sums herein provided to be paid by Lessees to Lessor. 

^^**Mutual Cooperation; Further Assurances**. Upon request by either Party from time to time during the Term, each Party hereto agrees to execute and deliver all such other and additional instruments, notices and other documents and do all such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Lease and to more fully assure the Parties’ rights and interests provided for hereunder. Lessor and each Lessee agrees to reasonably cooperate with the other on all matters relating to required Permits and regulatory compliance by either Lessees or Lessor in respect of the Premises so as to ensure continued full operation of the Premises by Lessees pursuant to the terms of this Lease. 

^^**Recording**. Upon the request of Lessor or Lessees, Lessor and Lessees shall execute, acknowledge, deliver and record a “short form” memorandum of this Lease in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto and made a part hereof for all purposes. Promptly upon request by Lessor at any time following the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, however such termination may be brought about, Lessees shall execute and deliver to Lessor an instrument, in recordable form, evidencing the termination of this Lease and the release by Lessees of all of Lessees’ right, title and interest in and to the Premises existing under and by virtue of this Lease (the “**Lessee Release**”) and each Lessee grants Lessor an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest for the purpose of executing the Lessee Release in the name of the Lessees. This Section 11.13 shall survive the termination of this Lease. 

^^**Binding Effect**. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, this Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, sublessees and assigns. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to waive the conditions elsewhere contained in this Lease applicable to assignment or subletting of the Premises by the Parties. 

^^**Choice of Law**. The provisions of this Lease shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Oklahoma, excluding any conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might require the application of laws of another jurisdiction. 

^^^^^ 
^^**Warranty of Peaceful Possession**. Lessor covenants and warrants that Lessees, upon paying the Rent reserved hereunder and observing and performing all of the covenants, conditions and provisions on Lessees’ part to be observed and performed hereunder, may peaceably and quietly have, hold, occupy, use and enjoy, and, subject to the terms of this Lease, shall have the full, exclusive, and unrestricted use and enjoyment of, all the Premises during the Term for the purposes permitted herein, and Lessor agrees to warrant and forever defend title to the Premises against the claims of any and all persons whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof. 

^^**Force Majeure**. In the event of Lessor or any Lessee being rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations under this Lease, other than to make payments due hereunder and the obligations under Section 11.16, it is agreed that on such Party’s giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the other Party as soon as practicable after the occurrence of the cause relied on, then the obligations of the Parties, so far as they are affected by such Force Majeure, shall be suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused but for no longer period, and such cause shall, as far as possible, be remedied with all reasonable dispatch. It is understood and agreed that the settlement of strikes or lockouts shall be entirely within the discretion of the Party having the difficulty, and that the above requirements that any Force Majeure shall be remedied with all reasonable dispatch shall not require the settlement of strikes or lockouts by acceding to the demands of the opposing party when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the Party having the difficulty. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, inability of a Party to make payments when due, be profitable or to secure funds, arrange bank loans or other financing, obtain credit or have adequate capacity or production (other than for reasons of Force Majeure) shall not be regarded as events of Force Majeure. 

^^**Survival**. All obligations of Lessor and Lessees that shall have accrued under this Lease prior to the expiration or earlier termination hereof shall survive such expiration or termination to the extent the same remain unsatisfied as of the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. Lessor and Lessees further expressly agree that all provisions of this Lease which contemplate performance after the expiration or earlier termination hereof shall survive such expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 

^^**AS IS, WHERE IS**. SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF LESSOR UNDER THIS LEASE INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH IN** **,**  **AND** SECTION 11.16, LESSEES HEREBY ACCEPT THE PREMISES “AS IS”, “WHERE IS”, AND “WITH ALL FAULTS”, AND LESSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, UNDER THIS LEASE AS TO THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE PREMISES, INCLUDING THE PREMISES’ MERCHANTABILITY, HABITABILITY, CONDITION, FITNESS, OR SUITABILITY FOR ANY PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE.** 

^^**Relocation of Pipelines; Amendment**. If Lessor elects to move certain pipelines within the Refinery Site, and such relocation of the pipelines requires relocation of any of the Relevant Assets, then this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect; provided, however, the Parties shall execute an amendment hereto reflecting the new location(s) of the Relevant Assets. 

^^^^^ 
^^**Option**. Following the termination or expiration of the Throughput Agreement, including any renewal, extension, or replacement agreement thereof subject to Section 7 of the Throughput Agreement, Lessor shall have an option, and Lessees hereby grant such option, to purchase the Relevant Assets at a cost equal to the fair market value thereof, as reasonably determined by Lessor and Lessees. In the event that Lessor and Lessees cannot agree as to the fair market value of the Relevant Assets, each party shall select a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers shall give their opinion of the fair market value of the Relevant Assets within 20 days after their retention. In the event the opinions of the two appraisers differ and, after good faith efforts over the succeeding 20-day period, they cannot mutually agree, the appraisers shall immediately and jointly appoint a third qualified appraiser. The third appraiser shall immediately (within five days) choose either the determination of Lessor’s appraiser or Lessees’ appraiser and such choice of this third appraiser shall be final and binding on Lessor and Lessees. Each party shall pay its own costs for its appraiser. Following the determination of the fair market value of the Relevant Assets by the appraisers, the parties shall equally share the costs of any third appraiser. Upon Lessor’s exercise of the option granted pursuant to this Section, Lessor and Lessees shall cooperate to convey the Relevant Assets from Lessees to Lessor. The terms and conditions of this Section 11.21 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement or the Throughput Agreement. If Lessor chooses to exercise its option granted pursuant to this Section, the sale of the Relevant Assets shall be subject to the receipt of any consents or waivers required pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of [[Date 5: Date]], among Holly Energy Partners  Operating, L.P., the Banks party thereto, and Union Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, as such agreement may be amended, restated, otherwise modified or refinanced from time to time. 

^^**No Novation**. This Agreement shall be considered an amendment and restatement of the Original Lease and Access Agreement, and the Original Lease and Access Agreement is hereby ratified, approved and confirmed in every respect, except as amended hereby. This Agreement is not intended to constitute a novation of the Original Lease and Access Agreement and all of the obligations owing by the Parties under the Original Lease and Access Agreement shall continue (from and after the date of this Agreement, as amended hereby).
