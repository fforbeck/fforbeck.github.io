The determinations of the Committee pursuant to this authority shall be conclusive.

\centered SECTION IV

\centered **OPERATION OF INCENTIVE PLAN**

^**Determination of Bonus Measures**. Prior to the beginning of each Performance Period (except for the first Performance Period), or as soon after the beginning of the Performance Period as practical:

^The Committee shall determine the Bonus Measures applicable to the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer, if any. The Committee may not delegate this task. Bonuses to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and any other “covered employees” as defined in Section 162(m) of the Code, shall comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) for the payments to be deductible.

^The Chief Executive Officer, or his designee, shall determine the Bonus Measures for each other Participant.

^**Bonus Calculation Formula**. Subject to Section IV.6.A, the Bonus Calculation Formula for each Participant shall be set forth in the applicable Bonus Calculation Schedule and attached as an Appendix to this Plan.

^**Restatement of Financial Statements**.  
^If the Corporation awards a Bonus to a Participant entitled to a Bonus under Appendix B and the Bonus is based on financial statements that are later restated, the amount of the Bonus shall be adjusted to reflect the restated financial statements. Specifically, either the Corporation shall pay (on the applicable Payout Date or on the earliest practical date after the applicable Payout Date) any additional Payout owing to the Participant based on the restated financial statements; or (ii) the Participant shall refund any overpayment of Payouts that the Participant received from the Corporation. Any refund shall be made within 30 days of the date the Corporation gives the Participan t written notice that the restated financial statements have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The notice shall be deemed given five days following the deposit by the Corporation in the United States mail, postage paid, addressed to the Participant at his last address shown in the Corporation's books and records or to a more recent address if the Participant has given the Corporation written notice of the more recent address.

^Unless otherwise expressly provided in an Appendix, this provision is not applicable to Participants who are eligible to receive Bonuses under an Appendix other than Appendix B.

^**Maximum Bonus Payable**.  
^The Committee may, in its sole discretion, establish a maximum amount of aggregate Bonuses to be awarded under this Plan, or a maximum amount to be awarded to any group of Participants, expressed either as a percentage of a financial measure, such as Consolidated Earnings Per Share or Contribution, an absolute dollar amount, or in any other manner.

^Unless otherwise expressly provided in a Bonus Calculation Statement to the contrary, Participants may not be granted a Bonus that exceeds the following amounts:

^^^For members of the Senior Management Team, [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the Participant's Base Salary; and

^^^For all other Participants, [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the Participant's Base Salary.

^**Bonus Calculation Statement**.  
^^^The Corporation shall provide each Participant with a copy of a Bonus Calculation Statement applicable to that Participant and, in the case of a Participant’s first participation in this Plan, a copy of the Plan. The Corporation shall provide each Participant with a copy of an amended Plan if the amended Plan materially impacts the rights of that Participant.

^^^If a Participant does not receive a Bonus Calculation Statement or written notice that he is not eligible for a Bonus within 90 days of the commencement of a Performance Period, his Bonus shall be calculated in the same manner as it was calculated in the prior Performance Period.

^^^Except to the extent the information is required by law to be disclosed, or as necessitated by Section IV.3, no Participant shall be entitled to review the Bonus Calculation Statement applicable to any other Participant.

^**Modification of Bonus Measures**. The Committee and the Chief Executive Officer, as applicable, may add, delete or amend the Bonus Measures that it is responsible for establishing, but no addition, deletion or amendment shall be effective as to a past Performance Period or the then-current Performance Period.

^**Establishment of New Incentive Plans**.

^**No Guarantee of Payment**.  
^Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, this Plan does not constitute an inducement or consideration for the employment of any Participant, nor is it a contract between the Corporation or any Affiliate, and any Participant. Unless expressly provided otherwise in a Bonus Calculation Statement, the fact that an individual is a Participant does not guarantee that he will receive a Bonus. The Corporation may determine that, even if Bonus Measures are met, for reasons related to a particular Participant's individual performance, the Participant should not be entitled to a Bonus. The Corporation must give the Participant written notice of any such determination within 90 days following the last day of the applicable Performance Period.

^Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no Payout shall be made to a Participant unless the Participant is employed on a regular, full-time basis on the Required Payment Date. However, if the Participant dies or becomes disabled prior to the end of a Performance Period, the Corporation may, in the sole discretion of the Committee, pay the Participant or his estate an amount equal to the product of (x) the Bonus that the Committee determines that the Participant would have earned for the applicable Performance Period had the Participant continued in the employ of the Corporation for the entire Performance Period, and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed f rom the commencement of the applicable Performance Period through the Participant’s termination of employment by death or disability, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the applicable Performance Period.

^**Compliance with Applicable Law**. Bonuses shall be subject to applicable federal, state and local law. Without limitation, the Corporation shall withhold all amounts required to be withheld by foreign, federal or state laws, as well as all amounts withheld in accordance with the Corporation’s payroll practices.

^**Mode and Timing of Payment**.  
^Unless otherwise specifically provided in a Bonus Calculation Statement, Bonuses shall be paid in cash.

^Payouts shall be made on the following dates, each of which is a Required Payment Date:

^^^For Performance Periods ending [[Date 4]], Payouts shall be made in two equal installments, the first of which shall be made in the first week of October in that year and the second of which shall be made in the first week of January in the following year. For illustrative purposes, a Payout for the Performance Period ending on [[Date 7: Date]] shall be paid in two equal installments, one of which shall be in the first week of [[Date 8: Date]], and the other one of which shall be in the first week of [[Date 9: Date]].

^^^For Performance Periods ending [[Date 6]], Payouts shall be made in two equal installments, the first of which shall be made in the first week of March of the following year, and the second of which shall be made in the first week of July of the following year. For illustrative purposes, Payouts for the period ending [[Date 10: Date]] shall be paid in two equal installments, one of which shall be in the first week of [[Date 11: Date]], and the other one of which shall be in the first week of [[Date 12: Date]].

^Notwithstanding Sections 8.B(i) and 8.B(ii), (i) if it is administratively impractical to make a Payout by the Required Payment Date and such impracticability was not foreseeable at the time the Participant obtained a legally binding right to the Payout, the Payout may be made following the Required Payment Date but must be made as soon as administratively practical; and (ii) if making the Payout by the Required Payment Date would jeopardize the ability of the Corporation to continue as a going concern, the Payout may be made after the Required Payment Date as long as it is made as soon as it would not have such effect. If the provisions of this Section IV.8.C are applicable, but the Corpora tion can make a partial payment in compliance with these provisions, it may do so as long as the payment is made pro rata as to Payouts then due to all Participants.

\centered SECTION V

\centered **CHANGE OF CONTROL**

Unless otherwise determined by the Committee prior to a Change of Control, if a Change of Control occurs, the following provisions shall be applicable:

^The then-current Performance Period will terminate immediately prior to the Change of Control and the total Bonuses payable will be the amount payable assuming attainment for the applicable Participant of the Maximum Metrics Hurdles or the maximum bonus otherwise payable under a particular Appendix, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that have elapsed during the Performance Period up to and including the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Performance Period. All amounts so determined shall be paid on the date of the Change of Control.

^Except for the payment provisions set forth in Sections IV.8.B and V.1, this Plan and each Bonus Calculation Statement will automatically terminate on a Change of Control unless expressly determined otherwise by the Committee in its sole discretion.

\centered SECTION VI

\centered **APPLICABILITY OF CODE SECTION 409A**

If any compensation or benefits provided by this Plan may result in the application of Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, with respect to any Participant: (A) modify this Plan in the least restrictive manner necessary in order to exclude such compensation from the definition of “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A or in order to comply with the provisions of Section 409A, other applicable provisions of the Code, and any rules, regulations or other regulatory guidance issued under such provisions and with as little diminution in the value of the Bonuses to the Participants as practical; (B) elect to pay an amount in addition to the amount otherwise due, to cover excise taxes that may be due under Section 409A; or (C) make one or more of the Payouts as provided by this Plan, without modification.

\centered SECTION VII

\centered **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

^**No Third Party Beneficiaries**. The establishment of this Plan shall not confer upon any Participant any legal or equitable right against the Corporation or any Affiliate, except as expressly provided in this Plan. There are no third party beneficiaries to this Plan.

^**Employee at Will**. Unless a Participant has a written agreement signed by a duly authorized officer of the Corporation or its Affiliates providing otherwise, the Participant is an employee at-will and either he or the Corporation may terminate his employment with or without notice and with or without cause at any time.

^**Governing Law; Venue**. This Plan and all disputes related to this Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to principles of conflicts or choice of law which direct the application of the laws of a different state.** Venue for any dispute relating to this Plan shall be exclusively in Harris County, Texas.**

^**Waiver of Jury Trial and of Certain Damages**.** EACH PARTICIPANT WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS PLAN. NEITHER THE CORPORATION NOR ANY PARTICIPANT SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR ANY OTHER ENTITLEMENT FROM THE OTHER.**

^**Severability**. This Plan is intended to comply in all aspects with applicable laws and regulations. If any provision of this Plan is held by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be severed from the remainder of this Plan, and the remainder of this Plan shall be enforced. In addition, the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be deemed to be automatically modified, and, as so modified, shall be included in this Plan, the modification being made to the minimum extent necessary to render th e provision valid, legal and enforceable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if the severed or modified provision concerns all or a portion of the essential consideration to be delivered under this Plan by one party to the other, the remaining provisions of this Plan shall also be modified to the extent necessary to equitably adjust the parties’ respective rights and obligations hereunder.

^**Unsecured Plan**. This Plan is an unfunded and unsecured compensation arrangement. It is not governed by the Employee’s Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974. Neither this Plan nor any Bonus Calculation Statement or Bonus shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Corporation and a Participant or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive a Bonus under this Plan, that right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Corporation.

^**No Assignment of Rights Under Plan**. Until paid to a Participant, neither Bonuses nor any contingent or actual right, if any, to receive a Payout may be assigned, transferred or hypothecated without the prior written consent of the Committee, in its sole discretion. Any attempt by a Participant to assign his Bonus or his rights under this Plan without the prior written consent of the Committee shall be void ab initio.

^**Modification or Termination of Plan**. Unless otherwise expressly provided in a specific Bonus Calculation Statement, the Committee may, without the consent of any Participant, modify or terminate this Plan as to any future Performance Period. Any such action may be taken without the approval of the Corporation’s stockholders unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Corporation’s shares are traded. Termination or modification of this Plan shall not apply to the then-current Performance Period, and all Payouts from Bonuses earned during th e then-current Performance Period shall continue to be subject to the terms of this Plan, notwithstanding its modification or termination.

^**No Waiver**. No term or provision of this Plan may be waived unless the waiver is in writing and signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced. No failure on the part of any party to exercise and no delay in exercising, any right, power, or remedy under this Plan shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right under this Plan preclude any other or further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right.

^**Construction**. Whenever used in this Plan, the singular number will include the plural, and the plural number will include the singular, and pronouns in the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender will include each other gender, as the identity of the antecedent may require.

The Appendices are incorporated in this Plan as if set forth herein in full. The provisions of this Plan shall not be construed s trictly against the Corporation, but shall be interpreted in accordance with its intention, as determined by the Committee.

^**Supersedure**. This Plan supersedes all of the currently effective bonus plans of the Corporation unless the Corporation has delivered written notice to the contrary to the person entitled to benefits under such other bonus plans. However, this Plan does not supersede any other agreements between the Corporation and any Participant, including, without limitation, any stock option or other equity compensation agreements, and the portions of any agreements relating to protection of the Corporation’s confidential and proprietary information, non-competition, non-disparagement or non-solicitation.
