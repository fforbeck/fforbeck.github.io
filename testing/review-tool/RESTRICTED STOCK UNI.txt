\centered **RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT UNDER THE WESTWOOD ONE, INC. 2010 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN** 

**THIS AGREEMENT**, made as of the _____ day of _____, 201_____, by and between Westwood One, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”) and [name] (the “Participant”). 

**WHEREAS**, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted, and the stockholders of the Company approved, the Westwood One, Inc. 2010 Equity Compensation Plan (the “Plan”); and 

**WHEREAS**, the Company, through the committee under the Plan (the “Committee”), wishes to grant to the Participant restricted stock units (“Restricted Stock Units”) pursuant to the authority granted to the Committee under Section 9 of the Plan. 

**NOW, THEREFORE**, for and in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 

^**Grant of Restricted Stock Units**.

Subject to the restrictions and other conditions set forth herein, the Committee has authorized this grant of  Restricted Stock Units on , 201. A Restricted Stock Unit is a unit of measurement equivalent to one Share but with none of the attendant rights of a holder of a Share until a Share is ultimately distributed in payment of the obligation (other than the right to receive dividend amounts in accordance with Section 6 hereof). 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Restricted Stock Units awarded herein are subject to approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company at or prior to the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company and in the event that such approval is not received, this Agreement shall be null and void *ab initio* and the Restricted Stock Units awarded herein shall not be valid. 

^**Vesting.**

^^Except as provided in Section 2 of this Agreement, the Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder shall vest [[Percentage 1: Number]]% on , 201 and [[Percentage 1]]% on , 201 (each such date, a “Vesting Date”); provided that the Participant has not had a Termination any time prior to the applicable Vesting Date. 

^^[**ADD IF DESIRED:** Upon a Change in Control, all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall immediately vest. In the event such a Change in Control occurs, the term “Vesting Date” shall include the date any unvested Restricted Stock Units vest hereunder.**]** 

^^Upon the Participant’s Termination for Cause, all outstanding Restricted Stock Units (whether vested or unvested) shall immediately terminate and be forfeited upon such Termination. In the event that the Participant has received any Share(s) relating to a vested Restricted Stock Unit, the Participant shall return or repay to the Company the Share(s) or the value of such Share(s) on the date such Share(s) were paid to the Participant. 

^^^^^ 
^^Restricted Stock Units that are not vested as of the date of the Participant’s Termination for any reason shall terminate and be forfeited in their entirety as of the date of such Termination. 

^**Payment****.**

Unless the Participant timely elects to defer payment of a Share with respect to a vested Restricted Stock Unit as provided in Section 4, one Share shall be distributed with respect to each vested Restricted Stock Unit within 30 days following the applicable Vesting Date. 

^**Right to Defer****.**

^^No later than the date of grant, the Participant may elect to defer distribution of the Shares relating only to his or her vested Restricted Stock Units. If the Participant so elects to defer, the election to defer shall provide that the distribution of the Shares relating to the Participant’s vested Restricted Stock Units shall be distributed on either: 

^^^a date specified by the Participant in the election form referred to in Section 4(c), which date shall not be earlier than , 201, provided, however, that in the event that the Participant’s Termination occurs prior to the date specified by the Participant, such Shares shall be distributed within 30 days following such Termination; or
^^^within 30 days following the Participant’s Termination.

^^If so elected, the Participant may not extend or otherwise change the deferral period elected under Section 4(a). 

^^An election to defer distribution of the Shares relating to a Participant’s vested Restricted Stock Units under Section 4(a) shall be in writing on a form prescribed by the Company and shall be delivered to the Committee. In the absence of a written election to defer filed by the Participant with the Committee, any vested Restricted Stock Units shall be distributed in accordance with Section 3. 

^**Restrictions on Transfer****.**

Restricted Stock Units may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution. 

^**Dividend Equivalents****.**

Cash dividends on Shares shall be credited to a dividend book entry account on behalf of each Participant with respect to each Restricted Stock Unit granted to a Participant, and shall be deemed to be reinvested in Shares on the date the cash dividend is paid, provided that the Participant shall not be entitled to such dividend unless and until the Restricted Stock Unit vests. Stock dividends on Shares shall be credited to a dividend book entry account on behalf of each Participant with respect to each Restricted Stock Unit granted to a Participant, provided that the Participant shall not be entitled to such dividend unless and until the Restricted Stock Unit vests. In either case, the dividends shall be distributed within 30 days of the applicable Vesting Date, unless the Participant timely elects to defer payment of the Shares as permitted under Section 4(a) hereof. If the Participant elects to defer payment of the Shares, payment of dividends shall be made at the time elected by the Participant as provided under Section 4. 

Insert second anniversary of date of grant.

^^This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, including via facsimile, each of which shall constitute an original copy, and all of which taken together shall constitute one contract.
