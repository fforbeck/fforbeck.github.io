To the extent reasonable and practical given the information readily available to the Indemnified Party, such notice to the Indemnifying Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detai l and shall indicate (without prejudice to the Indemnified Party’s rights) the estimated amount of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party in respect thereof, provided that the failure to give such notice within such time period shall not reduce the Indemnified Party’s rights hereunder, except to the extent of any actual prejudice suffered as a result of such failure.

^The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by giving notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim and subject to the rights of any insurer or other Third Party having potential liability therefor, to elect to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party’s own expense and by the Indemnifying Party’s own counsel, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim: (i) alleging any criminal or quasi-criminal wrongdoing (including fraud), (ii) which impugns the reputation of the Indemnified Party or (iii) where the Third Party making the Third Party Claim is a Governmental Body.

In addition, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defence of any Third Party Claim (and in so doing may retain its own counsel) at the cost and expense of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party does not consent to a settlement or compromise in respect of a Third Party Claim proposed by the Indemnifying Party, and the Losses in respect of such Third Party Claim, as determined by a final , non-appealable order or judgment, exceed the amount of Losses under the proposed settlement or compromise (the “Settlement Amount”), then the indemnification to which the Indemnified Party is entitled under this Article 6 in respect of such Third Party Claim shall equal the Settlement Amount.

^With respect to any Third Party Claim in respect of which the Indemnified Party has given notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 6.7 and in respect of which the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the defence or has not elected to do so, the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) such defence assisted by counsel of its own choosing at the Indemnifying Party’s sole cost and expense and, prior to settling or compromising any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall obtain the consent of the Indemnifying Party regarding such settlement or compromise, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by the Indemnifying Party.

^At their own cost and expense, the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to make available to the Party which is undertaking and controlling the defence of any Third Party Claim:

^^those employees whose assistance, testimony or presence is necessary to assist such Party in evaluating and in defending any Third Party Claim; and

^^all documents, records and other materials in the possession of such Party reasonably required by such Party for its use in defending any Third Party Claim,

and shall otherwise co-operate with the Party defending such Third Party Claim.

^If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim as provided in Section 6.7(2) and fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within 30 days after receiving notice from the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party bona fide believes on reasonable grounds that the Indemnifying Party has failed to take such steps, the Indemnified Party may, at its option, elect to assume the defence of and to compromise or settle the Third Party Claim assisted by counsel of its own choosing and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred in connection therewith; provided, that prior to settling or compromising any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have obtain ed the consent of the Indemnifying Party regarding such settlement or compromise, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by the Indemnifying Party.

^Upon making a full Loss Payment, the Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the rights of any insurers and to the extent of such Loss Payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party in respect of the Loss to which the Loss Payment relates.

^Any Person providing indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article 6 is referred to herein as an “Indemnifying Party”, and any Person entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the provisions of this Article 6 is referred to herein as an “Indemnified Party”.

^^Calculation of Damages  

The Losses suffered by any Party hereto shall be calculated after giving effect to the receipt by the Indemnified Party of any recoveries from third parties, including insurance recoveries (it being understood and agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall not be required to seek insurance recoveries in respect of Losses to be indemnified hereunder), and shall take into account any Tax effects. In the event any insurance proceeds are actually realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to the receipt by such Indemnified Party of a Loss Payment hereunder in respect of the Claims to which such insurance proceeds relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party regarding the amount of such Loss Payment.

^^Mitigation  

Leucadia and the Purchaser Parties shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any Claim or Loss with respect to which one Party is obligated to indemnify the other Party hereunder, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such Claim or Loss.

^^No Duplication  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, any amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Article 6 shall be paid without duplication, and in no event shall any Party be indemnified under different provisions of this Agreement for the same Losses.

^^Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments

Leucadia and the Purchaser Parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article 6 as an adjustment to the purchase price for all income tax purposes.

^^Public Announcements and Confidential Information

^Leucadia may disclose Confidential Information if required by Applicable Law or requested by legal process or regulatory authority to do so. If Leucadia is required by Applicable Law or requested by legal process or regulatory authority to disclose any Confidential Information, it will give prompt notice to [[4]] of that fact so that [[4]] may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with this Agreement and, further, such Party will co-operate in any efforts to obtain a protective order or other remedy at the expense of the Party or Parties such protective order or remedy. If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained or compliance with this Agreement is waived, such Party will disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information whi ch is required or requested.

^Each of Leucadia and the Purchaser Parties acknowledges that the other Party Group may not have an adequate remedy at law for damages and would be irreparably harmed if the covenants contained in this Section 7.1 are not performed.
