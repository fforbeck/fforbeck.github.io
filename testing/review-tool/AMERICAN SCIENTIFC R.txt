The number of Shares purchasable hereunder and the Exercise Price are subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4 hereof.

This Warrant is being issued by the Company in a private placement pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement by and between the Company and the Holder, dated the date hereof as amended and/or supplemented.

The person or persons in whose name(s) any certificate(s) repre­senting Shares shall be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have become the holder(s) of record of, and shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of, the Shares represented thereby (and such Shares shall be deemed to have been issued) immediately prior to the close of business on the date or dates upon which this Warrant is exercised.

^^**Stock Certificates**.

In the event this Warrant is exercised in part, the Company at its expense will execute and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor exercisable for the number of Shares for which this Warrant may then be exercised.

^^**Taxes**. The issuance of the Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant, and the delivery of certificates or other instruments representing such Shares, shall be made without charge to the Holder for any tax or other charge in respect of such issuance.

^^**Call Provision**. At any time at which the Closing Price of the Company's Common Stock is at or exceeds $.01 for any ten Trading Days during any twenty consecutive Trading Days, as adjusted for stock splits, combinations, recapitalizations and the like, the Company may elect to call this Warrant; provided however, the Company may not call this Warrant unless a registration statement is effective and the Common Stock is listed or quoted on an Eligible Market ("**Eligible Market**" means the OTC Bulletin Board, the Pink Sheets, the NYSE Amex, The New York Stock Exchange, Inc., The NASDAQ Global Select Market, The NASDAQ Global Market or The NASDAQ Capital Market); provided further, however, that in no event shall the number of shares of Common Stock that may be acquired by the Holder upon exercise pursuant to the terms of this Section 1(d) at any time shall exceed a number that, when added to the total number of shares of Common Stock deemed beneficially owned by the Holder (other than by virtue of the ownership of securities or rights to acquire securities that have limitations on the Holder’s right to convert, exercise or purchase similar to the limitation set forth herein (the “**Excluded Shares**”), together with all shares of Common Stock deemed beneficially owned at such time (other than by virtue of the ownership of the Excluded Shares) by persons whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with the beneficial ownership by the Holder for purposes of determining whether a group exists or for purposes of determining the Holder’s beneficial ownership, in either such case for purposes of Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and Regulation 13D-G thereunder (including, without limitation, as the same is made applicable to Section 16 of the 1934 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder), would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder or such group of more than [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the shares of Common Stock for purposes of Section 13(d) or Section 16 of the 1934 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. The Warrant shall remain outstanding with respect to Warrant Shares that may not be issued to the Holder pursuant to the foregoing. In order for the Company to exercise its call right hereunder, (i) it must exercise the right by providing written notice (the “**Call Notice**”) to the Holder within 3 Trading Days after the 10th Trading Day in which the Market Price of the Company’s Common Stock is at or exceeded $.01, (ii) such notice must indicate the date (the “**Call Date**”) on which the Warrant shall be exercised, which date may not be sooner than 3 Trading Days, nor later than 5 Trading Days, after delivery of the Call Notice, and (iii) the closing price of the Common Stock on an Eligible Market on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Call Date must be equal to or exceed $.01. “**Closing Price**” means on any particular date (a) the last reported closing bid price per share of Common Stock on such date on the Trading Market (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. at 4:15 p.m. (New York City time)), or (b) if there is no such price on such date, then the closing bid price on the Trading Market on the date nearest preceding such date (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. at 4:15 p.m. (New York City time)), or (c) if the shares of Common Stock are not then publicly traded the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by an independent appraiser selected in good faith by the Purchasers of a majority in interest of the Shares then outstanding and reasonably acceptable

^**Warrant**.  

^^**Exchange, Transfer and Replacement**. At any time prior to the exercise hereof, this Warrant may be exchanged upon presentation and surrender to the Company, alone or with other warrants of like tenor of different denominations registered in the name of the same Holder, for another warrant or warrants of like tenor in the name of such Holder exercisable for the aggregate number of Shares as the warrant or warrants surrendered.

^^**Replacement of Warrant**. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of this Warrant and, in the case of any such loss, theft, or destruction, upon delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the Company, or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company, at its expense, will execute and deliver in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like tenor.

^^**Cancellation; Payment of Expenses**. Upon the surrender of this Warrant in connection with any transfer, exchange or replacement as provided in this Section 2, this Warrant shall be promptly canceled by the Company. The Holder shall pay all taxes and all other expenses (including legal expenses, if any, incurred by the Holder or transferees) and charges payable in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of Warrants pursuant to this Section 2.

^^**Warrant Register**. The Company shall maintain, at its principal executive offices (or at the offices of the transfer agent for the Warrant or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice to the holder hereof), a register for this Warrant (the “**Warrant Register**”), in which the Company shall record the name and address of the person in whose name this Warrant has been issued, as well as the name and address of each transferee and each prior owner of this Warrant.

^**Rights and Obligations of Holders of this Warrant**. The Holder of this Warrant shall not, by virtue hereof, be entitled to any rights of a stockholder in the Company, either at law or in equity; **provided**, **however**, that in the event any certificate representing shares of Common Stock or other securities is issued to the holder hereof upon exercise of this Warrant, such holder shall, for all purposes, be deemed to have become the holder of record of such Common Stock on the date on which this Warrant, together with a duly executed Notice of Exercise, was surrendered and payment of the aggregate Exercise Price was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such Common Stock certificate.

^**Adjustments**.  

^^**Stock Dividends, Reclassifications, Recapitalizations, Etc.** While this Warrant is outstanding, in the event the Company: (i) pays a dividend in Common Stock or makes a distribution in Common Stock, (ii) subdivides its outstanding Common Stock into a greater number of shares, (iii) combines its outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) increases or decreases the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding by reclassification of its Common Stock (including a recapitalization in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation), then (1) the Exercise Price on the record date of such division or distribution or the effective date of such action shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant may be exercised immediately before such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Exercise Price immediately before such event and the denominator of which is the Exercise Price immediately after such event.

^^**Subsequent Equity Sales**. If the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, as applicable, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall sell or grant any option to purchase, or sell or grant any right to reprice, or otherwise dispose of or issue (or announce any offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition) any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents entitling any Person to acquire shares of Common Stock, at an effective price per share less than the then Exercise Price (such lower price, the “**Base Share Price**” and such issuances collectively, a “**Dilutive Issuance**”) (if the holder of the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options or rights per share which are issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share which is less than the Exercise Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Exercise Price on such date of the Dilutive Issuance), then, the Exercise Price shall be reduced and only reduced to equal the Base Share Price and the number of Warrant Shares issuable hereunder shall be increased such that the aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the Exercise Price, shall be equal to the aggregate Exercise Price prior to such adjustment. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustments shall be made, paid or issued under this in respect of an Exempt Issuance. The Company shall notify the Holder, in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents subject to this Section, of such issuance, indicating in such notice the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the “**Dilutive Issuance Notice**”). For purposes of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 3(b), upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, after the date of such Dilutive Issuance the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares based upon the Base Share Price regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Share Price in the Notice of Exercise. “**Exempt Issuance**” means the issuance of (a) shares of Common Stock or options to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company pursuant to any stock or option plan duly adopted for such purpose, by a majority of the non-employee members of the Board of Directors or a majority of the members of a committee of non-employee directors established for such purpose, (b) securities upon the exercise or exchange of or conversion of the Debentures or Warrants issued pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement between the Company and Granite Financial Group LLC dated [[Date 2: Date]] and/or other securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding on the date hereof, provided that such securities have not been amended since the date hereof to increase the number of such securities or to decrease the exercise, exchange or conversion price of such securities, and (c) securities issued pursuant to acquisitions or strategic transactions approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Company, provided that any such issuance shall only be to a Person which is, itself or through its subsidiaries, an operating company in a business synergistic with the business of the Company and in which the Company receives benefits in addition to the investment of funds, but shall not include a transaction in which the Company is issuing securities primarily for the purpose of raising capital or to an entity whose primary business is investing in securities.

^^**Combination: Liquidation**. While this Warrant is outstanding, (i) In the event of a Combination (as defined below), each Holder shall have the right to receive upon exercise of the Warrant the kind and amount of shares of capital stock or other securities or property which such Holder would have been entitled to receive upon or as a result of such Combination had such Warrant been exercised immediately prior to such event (subject to further adjustment in accordance with the terms hereof). Unless paragraph (ii) is applicable to a Combination, the Company shall provide that the surviving or acquiring Person (as defined below) (the “**Successor Company**”) in such Combination will assume by written instrument the obligations under this Section 4 and the obligations to deliver to the Holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Holder may be entitled to acquire. “**Combination**” means an event in which the Company consolidates with, mergers with or into, or sells all or substantially all of its assets to another Person, where “**Person**” means any individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, association, joint-stock company, trust, un[[Company]] organization, government or any agency or political subdivision thereof or any other entity; (ii) In the event of (x) a Combination where consideration to the holders of Common Stock in exchange for their shares is payable solely in cash or (y) the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company, the Holders shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender of their Warrant, distributions on an equal basis with the holders of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon exercise of the Warrant, as if the Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such event, less the Exercise Price. In case of any Combination described in this Section 4, the surviving or acquiring Person and, in the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company, the Company, shall deposit promptly with an agent or trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the funds, if any, necessary to pay to the Holders the amounts to which they are entitled as described above. After such funds and the surrendered Warrant are received, the Company is required to deliver a check in such amount as is appropriate (or, in the case or consideration other than cash, such other consideration as is appropriate) to such Person or Persons as it may be directed in writing by the Holders surrendering such Warrant.

^^**Notice of Adjustment**. Whenever the Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock and other property, if any, issuable upon exercise of the Warrant is adjusted, as provided in this Section 4, the Company shall deliver to the holders of the Warrant in accordance with Section 10 a certificate of the Company’s Chief Financial Officer setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a description of the basis on which (i) the Board of Directors determined the fair value of any evidences of indebtedness, other securities or property or warrants, options or other subscription or purchase rights and (ii) the Current Market Value (as defined below) of the Common Stock was determined, if either of such determinations were required), and specifying the Exercise Price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant after giving effect to such adjustment.

^^**Notice of Certain Transactions**. While this Warrant is outstanding, in the event that the Company shall propose (a) to pay any dividend payable in securities of any class to the holders of its Common Stock or to make any other non-cash dividend or distribution to the holders of its Common Stock, (b) to offer the holders of its Common Stock rights to subscribe for or to purchase any securities convertible into shares of Common Stock or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or options, (c) to effect any capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger affecting the class of Common Stock, as a whole, or (d) to effect the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company, the Company shall, within the time limits specified below, send to each Holder a notice of such proposed action or offer. Such notice shall be mailed to the Holders at their addresses as they appear in the Warrant Register, which shall specify the record date for the purposes of such dividend, distribution or rights, or the date such issuance or event is to take place and the date of participation therein by the holders of Common Stock, if any such date is to be fixed, and shall briefly indicate the effect of such action on the Common Stock and on the number and kind of any other shares of stock and on other property, if any, and the number of shares of Common Stock and other property, if any, issuable upon exercise of each Warrant and the Exercise Price after giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to Section 4 which will be required as a result of such action. Such notice shall be given as promptly as possible and (x) in the case of any action covered by clause (a) or (b) above, at least ten (10) days prior to the record date for determining holders of the Common Stock for purposes of such action or (y) in the case of any other such action, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of Common Stock, whichever shall be the earlier.
