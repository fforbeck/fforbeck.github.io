Continued participation in the Company’s fringe benefits; provided, however, that such continuation of benefits after termination shall not apply to those fringe benefits which require a minimum number of hours of employment for participation, such as 401k, life insurance and other employee insurance. The Company shall reimburse Officer for COBRA payments for continued medical benefits and insurance for the severance period to the extent incurred. 

The Officer, to the extent determined to be nondiscriminatory under the Company’s qualified employee benefit plans, shall become fully vested in his benefits under such plans. Additionally, the Officer shall become fully vested with respect to any of the Company’s non-qualified benefit plans in which he is a participant. 

All other provisions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and unamended.
