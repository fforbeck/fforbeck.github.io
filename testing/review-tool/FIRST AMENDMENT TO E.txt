“For each calendar year of this Agreement beginning in 2009, the Employee will be eligible to receive a performance bonus (a “Performance Bonus”) of up to [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of his then-current base salary based on the achievement of performance targets to be set and determined annually by Live Nation in its sole and absolute discretion.

^Section 3(f) of the Original Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 

“Live Nation will, within 90 days of the date that the stockholders of Live Nation, Inc. approve either an amendment to the Live Nation, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan adding additional shares to such plan or a new equity incentive plan, recommend to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Live Nation, Inc.

In addition, if the Employee signs a general release of claims no later than 60 days following such termination in a form and manner satisfactory to Live Nation, then, subject to Section 8(g), within 90 days after such termination, Live Nation will (i) pay to the Employee a lump-sum amount, less appropriate withholdings, equal to the Employee’s then-current base salary for a period equal to the greater of (x) the remainder of the Term or (y) one year and (ii) accelerate the vesting and lapsing of restrictions on all unvested equity awards awarded to the Employee prior to the date of termination.” 

^The Original Agreement is and shall continue to be in full force and effect, except as amended by this First Amendment, and except that all references in the Original Agreement to the “Agreement” or words of like import referring to the Original Agreement shall mean the Original Agreement as amended by this First Amendment.
