\centered **Written Summary of Executive Incentive Compensation Plan for Named Executive Officers**

Each of Mr. Perisano, Ms. Dionne, and Mr. Robertson participates in the executive incentive compensation plan and is eligible to receive a bonus for 2010 of up to [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of base salary if certain objective performance metrics are met, with a target bonus of [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of base salary. Under the executive compensation plan, the performance metrics are weighted as follows: [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the bonus is dependent upon achievement of certain levels of growth in comparable store sales over 2009 levels, [[Percentage 3]]% of the bonus upon the achievement of certain levels of total sales and [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of the bonus upon the achievement of certain levels of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). If the Company does not achieve a minimum level of performance for the particular metric, the named executive officer would not be eligible to receive a bonus amount with respect to that metric under the Plan.
