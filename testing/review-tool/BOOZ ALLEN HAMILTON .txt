When Section 162(m) is applicable to

Performance objectives may be established on a Company-wide basis or with respect to one or more business units, divisions, Subsidiaries, or products; and in either absolute terms or relative to the performance of one or more comparable companies or an index covering multiple companies. 

When establishing performance objectives for a Performance Period, the Committee may exclude any or all “extraordinary items” as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and as identified in the financial statements, notes to the financial statements or management’s discussion and analysis in the annual report, including, without limitation, the charges or costs associated with restructurings of the Company or any Subsidiary, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, capital gains and losses, dividends, share repurchase, other unusual or non-recurring items, and the cumulative effects of accounting changes. Except in the case of awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), the Committee may also adjust the performance objectives for any Performance Period as it deems equitable in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Company, changes in applicable tax laws or accounting principles, or such other factors as the Committee may determine (including, without limitation, any adjustments that would result in the Company paying non-deductible compensation to a Participant). 

^^^^^ 
^^Maximum Amount Payable. If the Committee certifies in writing that any of the performance objectives established for the relevant Performance Period under Section 3(a) has been satisfied, each Participant who is employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries on the last day of the Performance Period for which the award is payable shall be entitled to receive an annual award in an amount not to exceed US $[[USD Value 1: Number]] If a Participant’s employment terminates for any reason other than for cause (including, without limitation, his death, disability, retirement under the terms of any retirement plan maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary or Company Approved Departure) prior to the last day of the Performance Period for which the award is payable, the maximum award payable to such Participant under the preceding sentence shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that have elapsed during the Performance Period in which the termination occurs prior to and including the date of the Participant’s termination of employment and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Performance Period. 

^^Termination of Employment. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion at the time the performance criteria are selected for a particular Performance Period in accordance with Section 3(a), if a Participant’s employment terminates for any reason prior to the date on which the award is paid hereunder, such Participants shall forfeit all rights to any and all awards that have not yet been paid under the Plan; provided that if a Participant’s employment terminates as a result of death, Disability or Company Approved Departure, the Committee shall give consideration at its sole discretion to the payment of a partial award with regard to the portion of the Performance Period worked. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant’s employment terminates for any reason prior to the date on which the award is paid hereunder, the Committee, in its discretion, may waive any forfeiture pursuant to this Section 3 in whole or in part but, to the extent Section 162(m) is applicable to the Company and the Plan, may not waive satisfaction of the performance objectives with respect to any Covered Employee. 

^^Negative Discretion. Notwithstanding anything else contained in Section 3(b) to the contrary, the Committee shall have the right, in its absolute discretion, (i) to reduce or eliminate the amount otherwise payable to any Participant under Section 3(b) based on individual performance or conduct or any other factors that the Committee, in its discretion, shall deem appropriate and (ii) to establish rules or procedures that have the effect of limiting the amount payable to each Participant to an amount that is less than the maximum amount otherwise authorized under Section 3(b). 

^^Affirmative Discretion. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary (including, without limitation, the maximum amounts 

^^^^^ 
payable under Section 3(b)), but subject in the case of awards paid in shares of the Company’s Common Stock or other awards under the Equity Incentive Plan to the maximum number of shares available for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan, (i) the Committee shall have the right, in its discretion, to grant any annual award in cash, in shares of the Company’s Common Stock, in other awards under the Equity Incentive Plan or in any combination thereof, to any Participant (except for a Participant who is a Covered Employee, to the extent Section 162(m) is applicable to the Company and the Plan) for the year in which the amount paid would ordinarily be deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes in an amount up to the maximum award payable under Section 3(b), based on individual performance or any other criteria that the Committee deems appropriate and (ii) in connection with the hiring of any person who is or becomes a Covered Employee, the Committee may provide for a minimum award amount in any Performance Period, regardless of whether performance objectives are attained. 

\centered SECTION 4. PAYMENT 

Except as otherwise provided hereunder, payment of any award amount determined under Section 3 shall be made to each Participant as soon as practicable after the Committee certifies that one or more of the applicable performance objectives have been attained (or, in the case of any award payable under the provisions of Section 3(d), after the Committee determines the amount of any such award) and in any event no later than two and a half months after the end of the fiscal year in which the Performance Period ends. The Committee shall determine whether any bonus payable under the Plan is payable in cash, in shares of Common Stock (including, but not limited to, restricted common stock or restricted stock units) or other awards under the Equity Incentive Plan, or in any combination thereof. The Committee shall have the right to impose whatever conditions it deems appropriate with respect to the award of shares of Common Stock or other awards, including conditioning the vesting of such shares or other awards on the performance of additional service.
