^Monthly Annuity Option. A Participant may elect to receive an annuity which is equal to the monthly normal retirement income determined under Sections 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, 3.05, 3.07 and 3.08, whichever is applicable. 

^^Contingent Annuity Option. A Participant may elect to receive a reduced retirement income, the amount of which will be determined by application of appropriate Actuarially Equivalent factors adopted by the Plan Administrator for the age and sex of the Participant and the contingent annuitant. The contingent annuity option provides: 

^^payments to the Participant for life; and 

^^continuation of such payments, or any part of them designated by the Participant, to the contingent annuitant, if surviving, for life. 

^Ten-Year Certain Option. A Participant may elect to receive a retirement income of Actuarially Equivalent value payable for life, provided that such income will be paid to such Participant or to the Beneficiary of such Participant for ten (10) years after the Participant’s retirement regardless of whether the Participant or Beneficiary survives such period. At the discretion of the Plan Administrator, any benefit payable hereunder to a Beneficiary may be commuted and paid in one sum. 

^Other Forms of Pension. A Participant may elect to receive a benefit payable over a period not less than the remaining lifetime of such Participant and, if the Participant so further elects, thereafter to the designated Beneficiary for as long as such designated Beneficiary survives the Participant in such other form having an Actuarially Equivalent value as may be approved by, and be subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by, the Plan Administrator. 

^^Rules Applicable to Contingent Annuity Option. 

^^If the Participant should die before the effective date of the contingent annuity option, no benefit will be payable to the contingent annuitant. 

^^If the contingent annuitant should die before the effective date of the contingent annuity option, the option will automatically be cancelled and the normal monthly retirement income will be payable to the Participant as if the option had not been elected. 

^^If the contingent annuitant should die before the Participant but after the effective date of the contingent annuity option, benefits will be payable or continue to be paid to the Participant on the reduced basis; *provided, however*, that if the contingent annuitant should die during the first four years following commencement of the retirement income payments to the Participant, the amount of the reduced retirement income payable to the surviving retired Participant will be increased by restoring a percentage of the reduction amount as follows: 

Death of Contingent  Annuitant During      Percentage of Discount Restored
First Year      [[Percentage 14: Number]]%
Second Year      [[Percentage 3]]%
Third Year      [[Percentage 15: Number]]%
Fourth Year      [[Percentage 2]]%
Fifth and Subsequent Years      [[Percentage 16: Number]]%

Executive Retirement Plan  amended & restated as of [[Date 1]]  (including amendments effective [[Date 2]])

^^If the retirement date is earlier than the effective date of the contingent annuity option, retirement benefits commencing at the actual retirement date will be made on the normal form of retirement income. If the Participant and the contingent annuitant are living on such effective date, the retirement benefit will be adjusted to provide retirement income on and after such date in the optional form.

^Alienation of Benefits. No benefits payable under the Plan will be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any action by way of anticipating, alienating, selling, transferring, assigning, pledging, encumbering or charging the same will be void and of no effect nor will any such benefit be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of the person entitled to such benefit. 

^Payment to Minors and Incompetents. If a Participant, Spouse, contingent annuitant or Beneficiary entitled to receive any benefits hereunder is a minor, or is deemed by the Plan Administrator or is adjudged to be legally incapable of giving a valid receipt and discharge for such benefits, they will be paid to the duly appointed guardian or committee of such minor or incompetent, or they may be paid to such person or persons who the Plan Administrator believes is or are caring for or supporting such minors or incompetents.

^Plan Voluntary. The Plan is purely voluntary on the part of the Company. Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor any amendment thereto, nor the creation of any fund or account, nor the payment of any benefit will be construed as conferring upon any Employee or Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliated Company, and all Employees and Participants will remain subject to discharge, discipline or termination to the same extent as if the Plan had never been established.
