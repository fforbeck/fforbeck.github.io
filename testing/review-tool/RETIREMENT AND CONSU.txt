Each of the Company and the Executive is a “Party”, and collectively they are the “Parties”.

WHEREAS, Executive currently serves as the Senior Vice President – Human Resources and Corporate Secretary of the Company, and

WHEREAS, the Parties have agreed that Executive will retire and resign from her positions with the Company and its subsidiaries effective at the close of business on [[Date 1: Date]] (the “Retirement Date”), and

WHEREAS, the Parties have agreed that Executive will provide services to the Company as a consultant from [[Date 2: Date]] through [[Date 3: Date]] (the “Consulting Period”); and

WHEREAS, the Parties wish to enter into this Agreement to set forth the terms and conditions related to Executive’s retirement, as well as the consulting services to be provided following such retirement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual promises contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, adequacy and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

^**Executive’s Retirement**. Executive shall retire and resign from her positions with the Company and its subsidiaries effective at the close of business on the Retirement Date, without any further action required by Executive or the Company. Executive will be paid her normal salary and benefits through the Retirement Date. After the Retirement Date, in accordance with the Company’s normal policy, the Company shall pay Executive a lump sum cash payment of all earned and unpaid salary and any accrued but unused vacation days owed to Executive as of her Retirement Date. Executive also shall receive such benefits as are provided Executive under Company's plans and programs in accordance with the terms of such plans and programs and this Agreement. Such benefits shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, vested retirement benefits under the Management Pension Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, the 401(k) Plan, and the Deferred Compensation Plan. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect Executive’s rights to receive all outstanding amounts under the Discretionary Bonus Agreement dated as of [[Date 4: Date]], between the Company and Executive.

^**Consulting Services**.  
^^During the Consulting Period, Executive shall provide consulting services to the Company with respect to strategic and operational matters regarding the Company’s business and to assist Executive’s successors, as reasonably requested by the Board of Directors or the Company’s officers (the “Consulting Services”). The Company shall exercise reasonable efforts to avoid conflicts between such requested Consulting Services and Executive’s other commitments, and Executive shall exercise reasonable efforts to fulfill the Company’s consulting requests in a timely manner, notwithstanding Executive’s other commitments.

^^In consideration for the Consulting Services, Executive shall be paid a consulting fee of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] which shall be paid in a lump sum within ten days after the Retirement Date. The Company shall reimburse Executive for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance of the Consulting Services, provided that Executive submits receipts for such expenses in a manner consistent with the Company’s expense reimbursement policies and procedures.

^^Executive agrees that any and all Company property in her possession shall be returned on her Retirement Date, except that during the Consulting Period, Executive shall retain and have the use of the Company-provided cell phone, at the Company’s expense. Executive shall also retain her current access to the Company’s physical and computer network facilities.

^^Executive assigns to the Company all materials, research, plans, specifications, works of authorship and other data and intellectual property generated, conceived or developed in connection with the Consulting Services (the “Developed Material”) and any resulting patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Works of authorship in any form of expression, including, manuals, plans, specifications and software developed in connection with the Consulting Services, are “works for hire” and belong exclusively to the Company. Executive will take all reasonable actions, at the Company’s expense, necessary to transfer to the Company all of Executive’s rights in and to the Developed Material.

^^It is the expectation and intent of the Parties that the Consulting Services will, from the start of the Consulting Period and thereafter, consist of services equal to or less than twenty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the average level of services performed by Executive for the Company during the immediately preceding thirty-six (36)-month period and therefore Executive’s termination of employment on the Retirement Date will constitute a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

^^It is the Parties’ intent that Executive shall render services to the Company during the Consulting Period in the capacity of an independent contractor, and not as an employee of the Company. Accordingly, Executive shall be responsible for the payment of all taxes on amounts received from the Company for the Consulting Services, and during the Consulting Period, the provision of the Consulting Services pursuant to this Agreement will not entitle Executive to be eligible to participate in any Company employee benefit plan, except to the extent that such plans permit retired employee participation.

^**Outstanding Equity and Incentive Compensation Awards.**

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan (the “AIP”), Executive shall be entitled to payment of Executive’s 2010 AIP award in accordance with the terms and conditions of such award as if Executive’s employment with the Company had not terminated prior to [[Date 3]]. In determining the award amount to be paid, Executive shall be deemed to have achieved the target level of the individual performance component of the award.

^^Executive has received awards of restricted stock (“Restricted Stock Awards”) and performance shares (“Performance Share Awards”) under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”) that have not vested or been paid. These outstanding Restricted Stock Awards and Performance Share Awards shall be treated as follows:

^^^All Restricted Stock Awards and Performance Share Awards granted to Executive in 2010 shall be forfeited by Executive on the Retirement Date.

^^^All other Restricted Stock Awards and Performance Share Awards granted to Executive shall not be forfeited, but shall continue in full force and effect without proration as if the Executive’s employment had not terminated prior to the lapse of the applicable Restricted Stock Awards restrictions or the payment of the applicable Performance Share Awards.

^^^Except as described above, Executive’s AIP award, Restricted Stock Awards and Performance Share Awards shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements evidencing such awards as well as the AIP and LTIP, as applicable.

^**Releases**
