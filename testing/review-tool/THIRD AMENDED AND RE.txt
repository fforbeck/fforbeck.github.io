^Rights Of Refusal.

^^Company’s Refusal Right. The Company has a right of first refusal (the **“*Company’s Refusal Right*”**)to purchase all or a portion of the Offered Stock, exercisable by written notice to the Selling Shareholder within thirty (30) days (the **“*Company’s Refusal Period*”**)after the date of the Selling Shareholder’s Notice to the Company. If the Company does not intend to exercise the Company’s Refusal Right in full, the Company will send written notice thereof (the **“*Company’s Expiration Notice*”**)to the Selling Shareholder, the Investors and the Founders at least fifteen (15) days before the expiration of the Company’s Refusal Period. The Company’s Expiration Notice will specify the remaining Offered Stock subject to the Shareholders’ Right of First Refusal described below.

[[Shares 1: Number]] Shareholder Rights of Refusal. If the Company does not exercise the Company’s Refusal Right to purchase all of the Offered Stock, then the Series C Holders and the

Series D Holders will have a first right (the **“*Series C/D Refusal Right*”**)and the Series A Holders, the Series B Holders and the Founders that are then still employees of the Company will together, on parity with each other but subsequent to the Series C Holders and the Series D Holders, have a secondary right (the **“*Shareholders Refusal Right*”**) to purchase all of the Offered Stock not purchased by the Company (the **“*Remaining Offered Stock*”**)*.* The Series C/D Refusal Right and the Shareholders Refusal Right may be exercised as follows:

^^Each Series C Holder and/or Series D Holder desiring to purchase any or all of the Remaining Offered Stock must, within the fifteen (15) day period commencing on the date of the Company’s Expiration Notice (the **“*Series C/D Refusal Period*”**)*,* give written notice to the Selling Shareholder and to the Company of such Series C Holder’s or such Series D Holder’s election to purchase up to its Pro Rata Share of the Remaining Offered Stock, including the number of shares and type of Remaining Offered Stock that such Series C Holder or such Series D Holder desires to purchase. For purposes of this Section 3.2,an Investor’s **“*Pro Rata Share*”**will be defined as a fraction, the numerator of which will be the number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock then held by such Series C Holder or such Series D Holder, and (ii) the denominator of which will be the sum of the total number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock then held by all Series C Holders and Series D Holders. Within five (5) days after expiration of the Series C/D Refusal Period, the Company will give written notice to each Series C Holder and each Series D Holder that purchases its full Pro Rata Share of the Remaining Offered Stock (each, a **“*Fully-Participating Series C/D Holder*”**)of any other Series C Holder’s or Series D Holder’s failure to do likewise. Within the ten (10) day period commencing after notice of such information, each Fully-Participating Series C/D Holder shall be entitled to obtain (unless the Fully-Participating Series C/D Holders agree otherwise in writing) that portion of the Remaining Offered Stock for which the non-Fully-Participating Series C/D Holders were entitled to subscribe, but for which the non-Fully-Participating Series C/D Holders did not subscribe, that is equal to the proportion that the number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock then held by such Fully-Participating Series C/D Holders bears to the total number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock then held by all Fully-Participating Series C/D Holders, with additional overallotment rights until all of the Remaining Offered Stock has been subscribed for or until no Fully-Participating Series C/D Holders desires to purchase any unsubscribed for Remaining Offered Stock.

^^If any Offered Stock remains unsubscribed for after the expiration of the procedures set forth in Section 3.2(a),then the Company shall given written notice thereof to each Series A Holder, each Series B Holder, and each Founder that is then still an employee of the Company, and each such Shareholder shall have the Shareholder Refusal Right, exercisable by written notice to the Company and the Selling Shareholder during the 10 day period thereafter (the **“*Shareholder Refusal Period*”**)*,* to purchase up to its pro rata share (based on such Shareholder’s ownership of Outstanding Common Stock relative to the Outstanding Common of such other Shareholders) of the remaining shares of Offered Stock, including in such election notice the number of shares and type of Remaining Offered Stock that such Shareholder desires to purchase. Within five (5) days after expiration of the Shareholder Refusal Period, the Company will give written notice to each Series A Holder, each Series B Holder, and each Founder that purchases its full pro rata share of the Remaining Offered Stock (each, a **“*Fully-Participating Shareholder*”**)of any other such Shareholder’s failure to do likewise. Within the ten (10) day period commencing after notice of such information, each Fully-Participating Shareholder shall be entitled to obtain (unless the Fully-Participating Shareholders agree otherwise in writing) that portion of the Remaining Offered Stock for which the non-Fully-Participating Shareholders were entitled to subscribe, but for which the non-Fully-Participating Shareholders did not subscribe, that is equal to the proportion that the number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock then held by such Fully-Participating Shareholder bears to the total number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock then held by all Fully-Participating Shareholders, with additional overallotment rights until all of the Remaining Offered Stock has been subscribed for or until no Fully-Participating Shareholder desires to purchase any unsubscribed for Remaining Offered Stock.

^^None of the Investors or Founders will have a right to purchase any of the Remaining Offered Stock unless the Investors and Founders, in the aggregate, exercise their collective rights of first refusal pursuant to this Section 3.2to purchase all of the Remaining Offered Stock in accordance with the terms hereof. Within twenty (20) days after expiration of the Shareholder Refusal Period, the Company will give written notice (the **“*Shareholders’ Expiration Notice*”**)to the Selling Shareholder, the Investors and the Founders specifying (i) that all of the Offered Stock was subscribed by the Company (and/or its assignees) and/or Investors and/or Founders exercising their respective rights of refusal; or (ii) in the event that the Company (and/or its assignees) and/or Investors and/or Founders did not elect to purchase all of the Offered Stock, that the Selling Shareholder is entitled to transfer the Offered Stock in accordance with Section 3.6hereof.

^^Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Offered Stock to be purchased by the Company exercising its Company Right of First Refusal or by a Shareholder exercising its respective Series C/D Refusal Right or Shareholder Refusal Right will be the Offered Price, and will be payable as set forth in Section 3.4 hereof. If the Offered Price includes consideration other than cash, the cash equivalent value of the non-cash consideration will be determined by the parties to such purchase or, if they cannot agree, by an independent valuation firm of recognized national standing mutually selected by the Selling Shareholder, on the one hand, and the Investors subscribing for a majority of the Offered Shares, on the other hand, which determination will be binding upon the Company and the Shareholders absent manifest fraud or error. If the Proposed Transfer in question is by operation of law or otherwise an involuntary transfer (including, without limitation, a Transfer incident to divorce, legal separation, bankruptcy or other proceedings, death or other involuntary transfer) (an **“*Involuntary Transfer*”**)*,* the purchase price for the Offered Stock shall be the fair market value of such Offered Securities, which shall be a price determined by the Board in good faith, determined within 30 days after the Company is put on notice of such transfer. Any Shareholder that is married agrees (and such Shareholder’s spouse agrees through the Consent attached hereto as ***Exhibit B***) that, upon the dissolution of such marriage, any divorce decree, separate maintenance agreement, property settlement, or similar agreement incident thereto shall include provisions permitting the parties hereto to have the options afforded to them hereunder to purchase from such spouse any interest of such spouse in any shares of the Company and shall otherwise include any necessary provisions to give effect to this Agreement in accordance with its terms and conditions.

^^Payment. Payment of the purchase price for Offered Stock purchased by the Company exercising its Company Right of First Refusal or by a Shareholder exercising its respective Series C/D Refusal Right or Shareholder Refusal Right will be made within ten (10) days after the date of the applicable Expiration Notice. Payment of the purchase price will be made, at the option of the Company or, as the case may be, by a Shareholder, (a) in cash (by check or wire transfer), (b) by cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding indebtedness of the Selling Shareholder to the Company or such Shareholder, as the case may be, or (c) by any combination of the foregoing.

^^Rights of Shareholder. Upon the date that payment is made for the Offered Stock purchased by the Company exercising its Company Right of First Refusal or by a Shareholder exercising its respective Series C/D Refusal Right or Shareholder Refusal Right, the Selling Shareholder will have no further rights as a holder of such Offered Stock, and the Selling Shareholder will forthwith cause all certificate(s) evidencing such Offered Stock to be surrendered to the Company for cancellation, and, as to purchases by Shareholder(s), for transfer to the purchasing Shareholder(s). By way of clarification but not limitation, a Shareholder’s exercise or non-exercise of its rights under this Section 3 or under Section 4shall not adversely affect its rights hereunder or thereunder with respect to subsequent Transfers.

^^**Selling Shareholder’s Right to Transfer.** If the Company, the Investors and the Founders have not elected to purchase all of the Offered Stock pursuant to exercise of the Company Right of First Refusal, the Series C/D Refusal Right, and the Shareholder Refusal Right, then, subject to the Right of Co-Sale pursuant to Section 4if the Selling Shareholder is a Founder, the Selling Shareholder may transfer that portion of the Offered Stock permitted to be sold by the Selling Shareholder to any Person named as a Proposed Transferee in the Selling Shareholder’s Notice, at the Offered Price or at a higher price, provided that such transfer (a) is consummated within 90 days after the date of the Selling Shareholder’s Notice and (b) is in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all applicable laws (including applicable securities laws). If the Offered Stock is not so transferred during such 90 day period, then the Selling Shareholder will not transfer any of such Offered Stock without complying again in full with the provisions of this Agreement.

^Right Of Co-Sale.

^^Right of Co-Sale. In the event that the Selling Shareholder who proposes to Transfer the Offered Stock is one of the Founders, and the Company and Investors have waived or failed to timely exercise their Rights of First Refusal to purchase all of the Offered Stock, each of the Investors will have the right to participate in the Transfer of any Offered Stock in the manner set forth herein (the **“*Right of Co-Sale*”**)*.* Pursuant to this Section 4,each Investor may transfer to the Proposed Transferee(s) identified in the Selling Shareholder’s Notice such Investor’s Pro Rata Share of the Offered Stock, by giving written notice to the Selling Shareholder within ten (10) days after the date of the Investors’ Expiration Notice, specifying the number of shares and type of Stock that such Investor desires to transfer to each Proposed Transferee by exercising the Right of Co-Sale. For purposes of this Section 4,a Shareholder’s **“*Pro Rata Share*”**will be defined as a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock then owned by such Investor, and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock then owned by all Investors having a Right of Co-Sale hereunder plus the number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock held by the Selling Shareholder who proposes the Transfer.

^^Consummation of Co-Sale. Each Investor, in exercising the Right of Co-Sale, may effect such Investor’s participation in such Transfer by delivering to the Selling Shareholder at the closing of the transfer of Offered Stock to such transferee (the **“*Closing*”**)one or more certificates, properly endorsed for Transfer, representing such Stock to be Transferred by such Investor. At the Closing, such certificates or other instruments will be transferred and delivered to the Proposed Transferee(s) set forth in the Selling Shareholder’s Notice in consummation of the transfer of the Offered Stock pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the Selling Shareholder’s Notice, and the Selling Shareholder will remit, or will cause to be remitted, to Investor within seven (7) days after such Closing that portion of the proceeds of the Transfer to which such Investor is entitled by reason of such Investor’s participation in such transfer pursuant to the Right of Co-Sale.

^Multiple Series, Classes Or Types Of Stock. If the Offered Stock consists of more than one series or class or type of Stock, each Investor has the right to purchase or transfer hereunder, as the case may be, such Investor’s Pro Rata Share of each such series, class or type of Stock; provided, however, that as to the Right of Co-Sale, (a) if such Investor does not hold any of such series, class, or type of Stock, and the Proposed Transferee is not willing, at the Closing, to purchase some other series, class or type of Stock from such Investor as part of such Investor’s Pro Rata Share, or (b) if the Proposed Transferee is unwilling to purchase any Stock from such Investor at the Closing (each such circumstance being referred to herein as an **“*Incomplete Co-Sale*”**)*,* then such Investor will have the put right (the **“*Put Right*”**)set forth in Section 6.2hereof.

^Put Right; Drag-Along Right.

^^Refusal to Transfer. Regardless of anything else contained in this Agreement, any attempt by any Shareholder to Transfer any beneficial or record ownership of any Stock in violation of any provision of this Agreement will be void and shall not confer on any transferee or purported transferee any rights whatsoever.

^^Put Right. If a Selling Shareholder transfers any Stock in contravention of an Investor’s Right of Co-Sale under this Agreement (a **“*Prohibited Transfer*”**)*,* or if an Incomplete Co-Sale occurs and the provisions of Section 5hereof apply, the relevant Investor may require such Selling Shareholder to purchase from such Investor, for cash or such other consideration as the Selling Shareholder received in the Prohibited Transfer or Incomplete Co-Sale, that number of shares of Stock (of the same class, series or type as transferred in the Prohibited Transfer or Incomplete Co-Sale, if such Investor then owns Stock of such class, series or type, and otherwise of Common Stock) having a purchase price equal to the aggregate purchase price such Investor would have received in the closing of such Prohibited Transfer or

Incomplete Co-Sale if such Investor had exercised and been able to consummate such Investor’s Right of Co-Sale with respect thereto (the Shareholder’s **“*Put Right*”**)*.* An Investor may exercise such Investor’s Put Right by delivery of written notice to the Selling Shareholder and the Company (a **“*Put Notice*”**)within ten (10) days after such Investor becomes aware of the Prohibited Transfer or Incomplete Co-Sale.

^Restrictive Legends; Stop-transfer Instructions; Voting Agreement and Board Observer Rights.

^^Restrictive Legends. Each Shareholder understands and agrees that the Company will cause the legends set forth below, or legends substantially equivalent thereto, as may be required by applicable law, to be placed upon any certificate(s) or other documents or instruments evidencing ownership of Stock by the Shareholder:

*THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN VOTING RESTRICTIONS AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL AND/OR RIGHT OF CO-SALE, AS SET FORTH IN A CERTAIN SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY THE HOLDER OF THESE SHARES, THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. A COPY OF SUCH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE COMPANY. SUCH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ARE BINDING ON TRANSFEREES OF THESE SHARES.*

^^Stop Transfer Instructions. Each Shareholder agrees, to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to herein, that the Company may issue appropriate “stop transfer” certificates or instructions and that, if the Company transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its records.

^^Voting Agreement and Board Observer Rights. Each Shareholder agrees to hold all shares of Stock registered in such Shareholder’s name or beneficially owned by such Shareholder, subject to, and to vote the such shares in accordance with, the provisions of this Section 8.3*.*

^^The Founders agree to use their reasonable best efforts to identify an individual to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company who is independent and who is not an employee, officer, or Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the ***Independent Director***)*,* and the Shareholders agree to cause, on or before [[Date 7: Date]], the election of the Independent Director to fill one of the five remaining non-Series C Director seats on the Company’s Board of Directors,

^^In any election of any Series C Director (as such term is defined in the Charter), the Shareholders will consult each other and will each vote at any regular or special meeting of shareholders (or by written consent) all of their shares of Series C Preferred Stock to elect to the Company’s Board of Directors the designee approved in writing by Shamrock. The Series C Directors may be removed from the Board of Directors of the Company without cause only upon the vote or written consent of Shamrock, and the Shareholders agree not to seek, vote for or otherwise effect the removal of any Series C Director without cause of the Series C Director without such vote or written consent. The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the rights granted hereunder are effective and that Shamrock enjoys the benefits thereof. Such actions include, without limitation, the use of the Company’s reasonable best efforts to cause the nomination and election of the director as provided above. The Company will not, by any voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be performed under this Section by the Company, and the Company will at all times in good faith assist and take action as appropriate in the carrying out of all of the provisions of this Section. However, regardless of the foregoing, the parties agree that until the earlier of (i) [[Date 7]], and (ii) the date of the election of the Independent Director, only one Series C Director shall be elected, and the other Series C Director’s seat shall remain vacant on the Board of Directors of the Company; provided, that during such period, Shamrock shall have the right to designate one (1) individual (the ***Series C Observer***)to attend all special and regular meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company and all committees thereof (whether in person, by telephonic or otherwise, at the election of the Series C Observer) in a non-voting observer capacity, in addition to any Series C Directors designated by Shamrock. The Company shall provide to the Series C Observer, concurrently with the members of the Board of Directors of the Company, and in the same manner, notice of such meeting and a copy of all materials provided to such members. The Company shall be permitted to exclude the Series C Observer from all discussions of the Board of Directors of the Company related to sensitive matters that require preservation of the attorney-client privilege and from discussion of any confidential information (unless the Series C Observer (or the Series C Observer’s employer) executes or has executed a reasonable and customary confidentiality agreement with respect thereto). All reasonable expenses incurred by the Series C Observer in attending or otherwise participating in Board of Director and committee meetings and performing duties requested by the Company will be reimbursed by the Company.

^^So long as the Series D Holders shall hold at least [[Shares 3: Number]] shares of Series D Preferred (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications, recapitalizations and the like), the holders of a majority of the shares of Series D Preferred then held by the Series D Holders shall have the right to designate one (1) individual (the ***Series D Observer***)to attend all special and regular meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company and all committees thereof (whether in person, by telephonic or otherwise, at the election of the Series D Observer) in a non-voting observer capacity. The Company shall provide to the Series D Observer, concurrently with the members of the Board of Directors of the Company, and in the same manner, notice of such meeting and a copy of all materials provided to such members. The Company shall be permitted to exclude the Series D Observer from all discussions of the Board of Directors of the Company related to sensitive matters that require preservation of the attorney-client privilege and from discussion of any confidential information (unless the Series D Observer (or the Series D Observer’s employer) executes or has executed a reasonable and customary confidentiality agreement with respect thereto). All reasonable expenses incurred by the Series D Observer in attending or otherwise participating in Board of Director and committee meetings and performing duties requested by the Company will be reimbursed by the Company.

^^Conversion Matters. If all of the shares of Series C Preferred are converted into shares of Common Stock as a result of the vote or written consent of the holders of not less than a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred pursuant to Section 5(b) of Article VI of the Company’s Charter, then each holder of Series D Preferred shall concurrently therewith take all such action as may be required to cause the conversion of all of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred into shares of Common Stock and, in connection therewith, shall execute and deliver such instruments, give such written assurances or consents, and do, or cause to be done, all things otherwise necessary, proper or advisable to cause and make effective such conversion of all of the shares of Series D Preferred, and the Company shall take all such action as may be required to cause and make effective such conversion of all of the shares of Series D Preferred.

^Termination and Waiver.

^^Termination. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Company Right of First Refusal, Series C/D Refusal Right, Shareholder Refusal Right, Right of Co-Sale, Investors’ participation rights set forth in Section 7hereof, and the right to appoint Board of Directors observers pursuant to Section 8hereof will terminate upon the earliest to occur of the following: (a) immediately prior to the closing of the QIPO (as such term is defined in the Charter); (b) the date on which this Agreement is terminated by a writing executed by the Company, the Founders, the holders of a majority of the Stock held by the Series A Holders, the holders of a majority of the Stock then held by the Series B Holders, the holders of a majority of the Stock then held by the Series C Holders; (c) the liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or (d) any consolidation or merger of the Company by, with or into a third party, in any case in which the Company’s shareholders of record immediately prior to such transaction do not hold, immediately after such transaction, at least a majority of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity.

^^Waiver. Any waiver by a party of any of its rights hereunder will be effective only if evidenced by a written instrument executed by such party or its authorized representative or the failure of such party to respond within the time required by the terms of this Agreement; provided that (a) the Series C/D Refusal Right, the Right of Co-Sale, and the Right of Participation may be waived in any particular transaction as to the Series C Holders only by the holders of a majority of the Stock then held by the Series C Holders, (b) the Shareholder

Refusal Right, the Right of Co-Sale, and the Right of Participation may be waived in any particular transaction as to the Series A Holders only by the holders of a majority of the Stock then held by the Series A Holders, (c) the Shareholder Refusal Right, the Right of Co-Sale, and the Right of Participation may be waived in any particular transaction as to the Series B Holders only by the holders of a majority of the Stock then held by the Series B Holders, (d) the Series C/D Refusal Right, the Right of Co-Sale, and the Right of Participation may be waived in any particular transaction as to the Series D Holders either by (i) the holders of a majority of the Stock then held by the Series D Holders, or (ii) only in circumstances where such holders also waive such rights as to themselves in such transaction, by the holders of a majority of the Stock then held by the Series C Holders, (e) the Shareholder Refusal Right may be waived in any particular transaction as to the Founders only by the Founders, and (f) the Series D Board Observer right specified in Section 8.3(c)above may be amended or deleted only by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred. The Company and the Shareholders will have the absolute right to exercise or refrain from exercising any right or rights that each such party may have by reason of this Agreement, including without limitation the right to purchase or participate in the sale of Offered Stock, and no waiver of any particular right with respect to any particular transaction will be deemed a waiver with respect to any other transaction, nor will it be deemed a waiver of any other right under this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any Shareholder will incur any liability to any other party hereto with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any such right or rights.

^^**Titles and Subtitles; Interpretation.** The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this Agreement.
