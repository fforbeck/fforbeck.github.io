I understand that as an employee of Intelligroup it is my duty to understand the nature of Confidential Information and I will request clarification as necessary.

^Intelligroup Policies. I understand that Intelligroup has developed certain employment practices, policies and procedures. I agree to review and abide by all Intelligroup’s employment practices, policies and procedures set forth in the Intelligroup Employee Handbook or otherwise distributed by Intelligroup’s Human Resources Department.

^Confidentiality**.** I understand and agree that my employment creates a relationship of confidence and trust between myself and the Company with respect all Confidential Information. At all times, both during my employment with the Company and after its termination, I will keep in confidence and trust all such Confidential Information, and will not use or disclose any such Confidential Information without the advance written consent of the Company, except as may be necessary in the ordinary course of performing my duties to the Company. The restrictions set forth in this Section 2 will not apply to information which is generally known to the public or in the trade, unless such knowledge results from an unauthorized disclosure by me, but this exception will not affect the application of any other provision of this Agreement to such information in accordance with the terms of such provision. I likewise agree to immediately report to my supervisor any violation of the Company’s security measures or prohibited disclosure of Confidential Information by any person or organization. I agree to immediately report to my supervisor the names of any persons or organizations that attempt to obtain Confidential Information from me.

^Documents, records, etc. All documents, records, apparatus, equipment and other physical property, including but not limited to papers, notebooks, manuals, reports, desktops, laptops, printers, mobile phones, remote email assistants, computer files, software, vehicles, tools, keys, entry cards or badges, credit authorizations, user identifications and passwords, whether or not pertaining to Proprietary Information, which are furnished to me by the Company or are produced by me in connection with my employment will be and remain the sole property of the Company.

The Company will be the sole owner of all patents, copyrights and other proprietary rights in and with respect to such Work Product. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such Work Product will be deemed works made for hire. I hereby transfer and assign to the Company any proprietary rights which I may have or acquire in any such Work Product, and I waive any moral rights or other special rights which I may have or accrue therein. I agree to execute any documents and take any actions that may be required to effect and confirm such transfer and assignment and waiver. The provisions of this Section 4 will apply to all Work Products which are conceived or developed during the term of my employment with the Company, whether before or after the date of this Agreement, and whether or not further development or reduction to practice may take place after termination of my employment, for which purpose it will be presumed that any Work Product conceived by me which are reduced to practice within one year after termination of my employment were conceived during the term of my employment with the Company unless I am able to establish a later conception date by clear and convincing written evidence. The provisions of this Section 5 will not apply, however, to any Inventions which may be disclosed in a separate Schedule attached to this Agreement prior to its acceptance by the Company, representing Inventions made by me prior to my employment by the Company.

^Disclosure of Inventions**.** I agree promptly to disclose to the Company, or any persons designated by it, in writing, all Work Products which are or may be subject to the provisions of Section 5.

^Obtaining and Enforcing Proprietary Rights**.** I agree to assist the Company, at the Company's request from time to time and at the Company's expense, to obtain and enforce patents, copyrights or other proprietary rights with respect to Work Product in any and all countries. I will execute all documents reasonably necessary or appropriate for this purpose. This obligation will survive the termination of my employment, provided that the Company will compensate me at a reasonable rate after such termination for time actually spent by me at the Company's request on such assistance. In the event that the Company is unable for any reason whatsoever to secure my signature to any document reasonably necessary or appropriate for any of the foregoing purposes (including renewals, extensions, continuations, divisions or continuations in part), I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agents and attorneys-in-fact to act for me and on my behalf, but only for the purpose of executing and filing any such document and doing all other lawfully permitted acts to accomplish the foregoing purposes with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me.

^Solicitation of Employees**.** I agree that during and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of my employment with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, I shall not either directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company’s employees or independent contractors to leave their employment or end their business relationship with the Company, or take away such employees or independent contractors, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage, or take away any of the Company’s employees or independent contractors, either for myself or for any other person or entity. I agree that if I breach, or propose to breach, any portion of this Section 8, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to all other remedies that it may have, to damages, damages associated with recruiting costs and training costs for replacing Company’s employee.

^Competitive Activities**.** I agree that while I am employed by the Company and for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of my employment with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, I will not, without the Company’s express written consent, directly or indirectly, whether as owner, partner, shareholder, director, officer, consultant, agent, employee, contractor, or otherwise: a) engage in any business that, in a reasonable judgement of the Company, is competitive with the Company or which may, in the reasonable judgement of the Company , become competitive with the Company in the foreseeable future, or assist others in any business that is competitive with the Company; b) solicit or accept employment or similar business from, contract with or otherwise assist any customer, partner or other company with which the Company had a business agreement within twelve (12) months preceding the solicitation of such services, except in the course of your employment with the Company; or c) cause or seek to have any customer, partner or other company which the Company has a business agreement with to end or otherwise detrimentally alter their business relationship with the Company.

^understand that the restrictions set forth in this Section 9 are intended to protect the Company's legitimate interest in its Proprietary Information and established customer relationships and goodwill, and agree that such restrictions are necessary, reasonable and appropriate for this purpose.

^Third-Party Agreements and Rights**.** I hereby confirm that I am not bound by the terms of any agreement with any previous employer or other party which restricts in any way my use or disclosure of information or my engagement in any business, except as may be disclosed in a separate Schedule attached to this Agreement prior to its acceptance by the Company. I have delivered to the Company true and complete copies of any agreements listed on said Schedule. I represent to the Company that my execution of this Agreement, my employment with the Company and the performance of my proposed duties for the Company will not violate any obligations I may have to any such previous employer or other party. In my work for the Company, I will not disclose or make use of any information in violation of any agreements with or rights of any such previous employer or other party, and I will not bring to the premises of the Company any copies or other tangible embodiments of non-public information belonging to or obtained from any such previous employment or other party.

^Other Employment**.** During the term of my employment with the Company, I agree to keep the Company informed of any outside employment rendered by me and that such employment will not adversely affect my employment with the Company. For a period of one (1) year after the termination of my employment with the Company, I will inform any prospective employer, before accepting such employment, of the terms of this Agreement.

^Equitable Remedies**.** I agree that it would be difficult to measure any damages caused to the Company which might result from any breach of the terms of this Agreement, and that in any event money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any such breach. Accordingly, I agree that if I breach, or propose to breach, any portion of this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to all other remedies that it may have, to an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief to restrain any such breach without showing or proving any actual damage to the Company. In addition, the party seeking to enforce performance of the terms of this Agreement shall be entitled to all reasonable attorneys fees and third party costs incurred in seeking enforcement of this Agreement, regardless of whether suit or other legal or equitable is commenced, including attorneys fees and costs incurred through engagement in alternative dispute resolution procedures such as mediation or arbitration fees.

^Binding Effect**.** This Agreement will be binding upon me and my heirs, executors , administrators and legal representatives and will inure to the benefit of the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, and its and their respective successors and assigns.

^Enforceability**.** If any portion or provision of this Agreement is to any extent declared illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such portion or provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, will not be affected thereby, and each portion and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of excessive scope as to geographic, temporal or functional coverage, such provision will be deemed to extend only over the maximum geographic, temporal and functional scope as to which it may be enforceable.

^Entire Agreement**.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Company and myself with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or waived except by a written instrument duly executed by the person against whom enforcement of such amendment, modification or waiver is sought. The failure of any party to require the performance of any term or obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement, in any particular case will not prevent any subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or to be deemed a waiver of any separate or subsequent breach.

^Employment at Will: Not a Contract or Fixed Term of Employment**.** I understand that this Agreement does not create any obligation on the part of the Company to continue my employment for any fixed term, and that my employment may be terminated by myself or the Company at any time for any reason, except as may be otherwise provided in a written agreement executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company. In fact, I understand that I am “employed at will” by the Company meaning that either the Company or myself may terminate my employment at any time and for any or no reason.

^Notices**.** Any notices, requests, demands and other communications provided for by this Agreement will be sufficient if in writing and delivered in person or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to me at the last address which I have filed in writing with the Company or, in the case of any notice to the Company, at its main offices, to the attention of its Chief Executive Officer.

^Governing Law**.** This is a New York contract and shall be construed under and be governed in all respects by the laws of New York, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles of New York law. Any legal action or suit related to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the courts of New York. Both parties agree that exclusive jurisdiction lies in the state and federal courts residing in New York City for the resolution of disputes.
