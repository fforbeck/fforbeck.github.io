Executive agrees that if Executive accepts other employment at any time during the entire twelve (12) months of the severance period, Executive shall notify the Company in writing within two (2) business days of such acceptance. Executive acknowledges that the Executive’s failure to abide by this provision shall entitle the Company to recoup all severance pay previously paid to Executive pursuant to this Employment Agreement.

The Company shall reimburse Executive for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Executive in fulfilling Executive’s obligations under this Section 11. In addition, to the extent that the Executive provides such assistance at any time after six months from the date that Executive’s employment with the Company has terminated, and Executive is required to be absent from employment for one or more days in order to provide such assistance, the Company shall pay the Executive for each such day an amount equal to the daily rate of the Executive’s Base Salary as in effect as of the date of termination.

^^^^^ 
^^As used in this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” means any and all confidential, proprietary or trade secret information, whether disclosed, directly or indirectly, verbally, in writing or by any other means in tangible or intangible form, including that which is conceived or developed by Executive, applicable to or in any way related to: (i) the present or future business of the Company or any of its Affiliates (as defined below); (ii) the research and development of the Company or any of its Affiliates; or (iii) the business of any client, vendor, supplier or distributor of the Company or any of its Affiliates.

^^Executive acknowledges that all original works of authorship which are made by the Executive (solely or jointly) are works made for hire under the United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C., et seq.).

^^Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the Company all Inventions, all original works of authorship and all work product relating thereto. This disclosure will include complete and accurate copies of all source code, object code or machine-readable copies, documentation, work notes, flow-charts, diagrams, test data, reports, samples and other tangible evidence or results (collectively, “Tangible Embodiments”) of such Inventions, works of authorship and work product. All Tangible Embodiments of any Invention, work of authorship or work product related thereto will be deemed to have been assigned to the Company as a result of the act of expressing any Invention or work of authorship therein.

^^Executive hereby assigns to the Company (together with the right to prosecute or sue for infringements or other violations of the same) the entire worldwide right, title and interest to any such Inventions or works made for hire, and Executive agrees to perform, during and after employment, all acts deemed necessary or desirable by the Company to permit and assist it, at the Company’s expense, in registering, recording, obtaining, maintaining, defending, enforcing and assigning Inventions or works made for hire in any and all countries.

^^Without limiting the generality of any other provision of this Section 4, Executive hereby authorizes the Company and each of its Affiliates (and their respective successors) to make any desired changes to any part of any Invention, to combine it with other materials in any manner desired, and to withhold Executive’s identity in connection with any distribution or use thereof alone or in combination with other materials.

^^This Agreement does not apply to any invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret information of the Company or any Affiliate was used and which was developed entirely on Executive’s own time, unless (1) the invention relates (a) to the business of the Company or any Affiliate or (b) to the Company’s or any Affiliate’s actual demonstrably anticipated research or development; or (2) the invention results from any work performed by Executive for the Company or any Affiliate.

\centered A-3 

^^^^^ 
^^The obligations of Executive set forth in this Section 4 (including, but not limited to, the assignment obligations) will continue beyond the termination of Executive’s employment with respect to Inventions conceived or made by Executive alone or in concert with others during Executive’s employment with the Company and during the one (1) year thereafter, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. These obligations will be binding upon Executive and Executive’s executors, administrators and other representatives.

^List of Prior Inventions.

All Inventions which Executive has made prior to employment by the Company or any Affiliate (including without limitation [[Company]]) are excluded from the scope of this Agreement. As a matter of record, Executive has set forth on Annex I hereto a complete list of those Inventions which might relate to the Company’s Business and which have been made by Executive prior to employment with the Company. Executive represents that such list is complete. If no list is attached, Executive represents that there are no prior Inventions.

^Non-Competition.

^^Executive acknowledges that: (i) the Company and its Affiliates are and will be engaged in the Business during the term of the Executive’s employment and thereafter; (ii) the Company and its Affiliates are and will be actively engaged in the Business throughout the world; (iii) Executive is one of a limited number of persons who will be developing the Business; (iv) Executive has and will continue to occupy a position of trust and confidence with the Company after the date hereof and during the term of the Executive’s employment Executive will become familiar with the Company’s (and its Affiliates’) trade secrets and with other proprietary and confidential information concerning the Company (and its Affiliates) and the Business; (v) the agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement are essential to protect the Company, its Affiliates and the goodwill of the Business; (vi) Executive’s employment with the Company and/or its Affiliates has special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company and its Affiliates and the Company would be irreparably damaged if Executive were to provide services to any person or entity in violation of the provisions of this Section 6; and (vii) Executive has means to support Executive and Executive’s dependents other than by engaging in the Business, and the provisions of this Section 6 will not impair such ability.

^^Executive will not, during the Restricted Period (as defined below), anywhere in the world (the “Restricted Territory”), directly or indirectly (whether as an owner, partner, shareholder, agent, officer, director, employee, independent contractor, consultant, or otherwise) own, operate, manage, control, invest in, perform services for, or engage or participate in any manner in, or render services to (alone or in association with any person or entity) or otherwise assist any person or entity that engages in, or owns, invests in, operates, manages or controls any venture or enterprise that engages in, the Business. The term “Restricted Period” means the

\centered A-4 

^^^^^ 
period of time from the date hereof until two (2) years after the termination for any reason of Executive’s employment relationship with the Company and/or any Affiliate or any successor thereto (including any termination based on non-renewal of any employment agreement or arrangement). The Restricted Period shall be extended for a period equal to any time period that Executive is in violation of this Section 6. Nothing contained in this Section 6 shall be construed to prevent Executive from investing in the stock of any competing corporation listed on a national securities exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market, but only if Executive is not involved in the business of said corporation and if Executive and Executive’s associates (as such term is defined in Regulation 14(A) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as in effect on the date hereof), collectively, do not own more than an aggregate of one percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the stock of such corporation.

^^Scope/Severability. The parties acknowledge that the business of the Company and its Affiliates is and will be national and international in scope and thus the covenants in this Section 6 would be ineffective if the covenants were to be limited to a particular geographic area. If any court of competent jurisdiction at any time deems the Restricted Period unreasonably lengthy, or the Restricted Territory unreasonably extensive, or any of the covenants set forth in this Section 6 not fully enforceable, the other provisions of this Section 6, and this Agreement in general, will nevertheless stand and, to the full extent consistent with law, continue in full force and effect, and it is the intention and desire of the parties that the court treat any provisions of this Agreement which are not fully enforceable as having been modified to the extent deemed necessary by the court to render them reasonable and enforceable and that the court enforce them to such extent (for example, that the Restricted Period be deemed to be the longest period permissible by law, but not in excess of the length provided for in Section 6(b), and the Restricted Territory be deemed to comprise the largest territory permissible by law under the circumstances but not in excess of the territory provided for in Section 6(b))*.*

^Non-Solicitation.

^^Executive will not, during the Restricted Period, directly or indirectly (whether as an owner, partner, shareholder, agent, officer, director, employee, independent contractor, consultant, or otherwise) with or through any individual or entity:

^^^employ, engage or explicitly solicit for employment any individual who is, or was at any time during the twelve-month period immediately prior to the termination of Executive’s employment with the Company and/or any Affiliate for any reason, an employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates or otherwise seek to adversely influence or alter such individual’s relationship with the Company or any of its Affiliates; or 

^^^solicit or encourage any individual or entity that is, or was during the twelve-month period immediately prior to the termination of Executive’s employment with the Company or any Affiliate for any reason, a customer, supplier or vendor of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate or otherwise alter his, her or its relationship with the Company or any Affiliate. 

^^The Restricted Period shall be extended for a period equal to any time period that Executive is in violation of this Section 7.

^Equitable Remedies.

Executive acknowledges and agrees that the agreements and covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company’s and its Affiliates’ business interests, that irreparable injury will result to the Company and its Affiliates if Executive breaches any of the terms of said covenants, and that in the event of Executive’s actual or threatened breach of any such covenants, the Company and its Affiliates will have no adequate remedy at law. Executive accordingly agrees that, in the event of any actual or threatened breach by Executive of any of said covenants, the Company and its Affiliates will be entitled to immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without posting bond or other security and without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages. Nothing in this Section 8 will be construed as prohibiting the Company or any Affiliate from pursuing any other remedies available to them for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of any damages that they are able to prove.

^Breach.

^^Executive’s breach of any of the Executive’s obligations under this Agreement will be deemed a material breach of any employment agreement or arrangement Executive has with the Company or any of its Affiliates and will constitute cause or due cause or the like for termination by the Company and/or its Affiliates, as appropriate.

\centered A-6 

^^^^^ 
^^In the event that the Company and/or its Affiliates, as appropriate, terminates Executive without cause or due cause or the like or Executive voluntarily resigns, Executive will receive severance payments, to the extent entitled under any employment agreement or arrangement, only if Executive is not in breach of any of the provisions in this Agreement.

^No Right to Employment.

No provision of this Agreement shall give Executive any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its Affiliates, create any inference as to the length of employment of Executive, affect the right of the Company or its Affiliates to terminate the employment of Executive, with or without cause, or give Executive any right to participate in any welfare or benefit plan or other program of the Company or any of its Affiliates.

^Modification and Waiver.

This Agreement may not be modified or amended or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties. No term or condition of this Agreement will be deemed to have been waived, except by written instrument of the party charged with such waiver. No such written waiver will be deemed to be a continuing waiver unless specifically stated therein, and each such waiver will operate only as to the specific term or condition waived and shall not constitute a waiver of such term or condition for the future or as to any act other than that specifically waived.

^Severability.

Executive acknowledges that the agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement are essential to protect the Company and its Affiliates and their goodwill. Each of the covenants in this Agreement will be construed as independent of any other covenants or other provisions of this Agreement. It is the intention and desire of the parties that the court treat any provisions of this Agreement which are not fully enforceable as having been modified to the extent deemed necessary by the court to render them reasonable and enforceable and that the court enforce them to such extent.

^Notices.

Any notice, consent, waiver and other communications required or permitted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been properly given (a) when delivered by hand; (b) when sent by telecopier (with acknowledgment of complete transmission), provided that a copy is mailed by U.S. certified mail, return receipt requested; (c) three (3) days after sent by certified mail, return receipt requested; or (d) one (1) day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, in each case to the appropriate addresses and telecopier numbers set forth below:
