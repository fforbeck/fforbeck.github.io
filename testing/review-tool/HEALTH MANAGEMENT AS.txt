^^^*Earned Cash Amount*. At the conclusion of the First Grant Year, the Performance Vesting Component will be eligible for payment based upon the achievement by HMA during the First Grant Year of the EBITDA Requirement pursuant to Section 2(d). The portion of the Performance Vesting Component that actually becomes payable based upon the achievement by HMA of the EBITDA Requirement during the First Grant Year is referred to herein as the “Earned Cash Amount.” The Earned Cash Amount will vest and be paid as follows:

^^^*Additional Earned Cash Amount*. In the event that all or any portion of the total amount of the Performance Vesting Component is not eligible for payment at the conclusion of the First Grant Year (and is not deemed an Earned Cash Amount) because HMA achieved less than [[Percentage 14]]% of the Targeted EBITDA for the First Grant Year, the portion that is not payable with respect to the First Grant Year shall be carried over to the Second Grant Year and will be eligible for payment if [[Percentage 14]]% or more of the Targeted EBITDA for the Second Grant Year is achieved. The amount, if any, that becomes eligible for payment pursuant to this Section 4(a)(ii) is referred to herein as the “Additional Earned Cash Amount.” The Additional Earned Cash Amount will vest and be paid as follows: 

^provided that you have remained an Eligible Person at all times from the Date of Grant until [[Date 2]] of the Third Grant Year, one-half of the total amount of the Additional Earned Cash Amount will vest on [[Date 2]] of the Third Grant Year and shall be paid to you as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in no event later than [[Date 3]] of the Third Grant Year; 

^provided that you have remained an Eligible Person at all times from the Date of Grant until [[Date 2]] of the Fourth Grant Year, an additional one-fourth of the total amount of the Additional Earned Cash Amount will vest on [[Date 2]] of the Fourth Grant Year and shall be paid to you as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in no event later than [[Date 3]] of the Fourth Grant Year; and 

^provided that you have remained an Eligible Person at all times from the Date of Grant until [[Date 2]] of the Fifth Grant Year, the remaining one-fourth of the total amount of the Additional Earned Cash Amount will vest on [[Date 2]] of the Fifth Grant Year and shall be paid to you as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in no event later than [[Date 3]] of the Fifth Grant Year. 

^^^*Example*. By way of example only, if the total amount of the Performance Vesting Component hereunder is $[[USD Value 2: Number]] and if HMA achieved [[Percentage 1]]% of the Targeted EBITDA with respect to the First Grant Year, the Earned Cash Amount with respect to the First Grant Year would be $[[USD Value 3: Number]] ([[Percentage 5]]% of $[[USD Value 2]] based upon the EBITDA Requirement set forth in Section 2(e)), and $[[USD Value 4: Number]] would vest on each [[Date 2]] of the Second Grant Year through the Fifth Grant Year, assuming that you have remained an Eligible Person at all times through the vesting dates. The $[[USD Value 3]] that was not deemed an Earned Cash Amount with respect to the First Grant Year would be carried over to the Second Grant Year for possible payment in accordance with Section 4(a)(ii). If HMA were to achieve [[Percentage 14]]% or more of the Targeted EBITDA for the Second Grant Year, the Additional Earned Cash Amount would be $[[USD Value 5: Number]] $[[USD Value 6: Number]] of which would vest on [[Date 2]] of the Third Grant Year, $[[USD Value 4]] of which would vest on [[Date 2]] of the Fourth Grant Year, and $[[USD Value 4]] of which would vest on [[Date 2]] of the Fifth Grant Year, assuming that you have remained an Eligible Person at all times through the vesting dates. If HMA were to achieve less than [[Percentage 14]]% of Targeted EBITDA for the Second Grant Year, no Additional Earned Cash Amount would be eligible for vesting. 

^^*Committee Certification*. As soon as practicable following the end of the First Grant Year (and if applicable, the Second Grant Year), the Committee shall determine and certify in writing if, and the extent to which, the EBITDA Requirement was satisfied, and the Earned Cash Amount (and if applicable, the Additional Earned Cash Amount), if any, to be paid based upon the certified levels of performance. 

^Effect of Death, Termination or Retirement. Without limiting the vesting and payment requirements set forth in Section 3 or Section 4, in the event of the termination of your employment with all Employers prior to the complete vesting and payment of the Award, or if you are otherwise not an Eligible Person prior to the complete vesting and payment of the Award, any and all unvested and unpaid amounts of the Award shall be forfeited and shall not vest or be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of your termination of employment with all Employers: (a) because of your retirement from all Employers at or after the age of 62, the Award will continue to vest and be paid following the date of your retirement in the manner and on the dates set forth above; and (b) because of your death or total and permanent disability, the Award will continue to vest and be paid in the manner and on the dates set forth above for a period of 36 months after the date of such termination of employment, and any unvested or unpaid portion of the Award at the conclusion of such 36-month period shall be forfeited. 

^Effect of Change In Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change In Control of HMA (as defined in Section 9(b) of the Plan), your rights will be determined in accordance with Section 9 of the Plan.
