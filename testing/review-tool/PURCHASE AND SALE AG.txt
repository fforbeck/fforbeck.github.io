^^Inspection and Assertion of Title Defects. 

^^Assertion of Title Defects. Buyer may, to the extent it deems appropriate, conduct, at its sole cost and expense, such title examination or investigation as it may choose to conduct with respect to the Interests. Should matters come to Buyer’s attention which would constitute “Title Defects” (as defined below in Section 11.3), Buyer may, if it so desires, notify Seller in writing of such Title Defects (a “***Notice of Title Defect***”). To be effective, a Notice of Title Defect 

shall be provided to Seller less than 7 days before the Closing Date (as may be extended as provided hereunder by Buyer and Seller) and shall include (i) a specific description of the asserted Title Defect or Defects, (ii) a specific description of the Interests or the portion of the Interests that are affected by the asserted Title Defect(s), and (iii) appropriate supporting documentation regarding the Title Defect(s), if any. In the event that the number of net leasehold acres affected by the Title Defect(s) asserted in good faith by Buyer is in excess of [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the number of the total net leasehold acres of the Interests set forth on **Exhibit “A” AND Exhibit “A1”**, then Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement. 

^^Imperfections in Title, Seller’s Opportunity to Cure Asserted Title Defects, and Cure Period. If Seller’s ownership of the Interests is subject to an imperfection in title which would cause a Title Defect, then, upon receipt of a Notice of Title Defect from Buyer, Seller shall have the option, at its sole cost and expense, to cure or remove, in part or in whole, the asserted Title Defect(s), to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer, for a period not to exceed 90 days following the Closing Date, (the “***Cure Period***”). Upon the expiration of Cure Period, Buyer shall pay Seller, pursuant to Section 3.1, for those Title Defect(s) which have been cured or removed, in part or in whole, or which Buyer elects to waive pursuant to this Section 11.2(b) (the “***Cured Interests***”). In the event Seller is unable to cure the asserted Title Defect(s) during the Cure Period, Seller shall retain ownership of those remaining Interests which were not purchased by Buyer in light of Buyer’s asserted Title Defect(s) (the “***Remaining Interests***”) and Buy shall not pay Seller for the Remaining Interests. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller will own the Remaining Interests without any further obligation to Buyer with regards to the Interests and/or Lease(s) that comprise the Remaining Interests. 

^^Title Defects. The term ***Title Defect*** as used in this Agreement shall mean the following: 

^^NRI or WI Variances. Seller’s ownership of the Interests is such that (subject to the Override), with respect to any lease listed on **Exhibit “A” AND Exhibit “A1”** hereto, it (i) entitles Seller to receive a percentage share of the oil, gas and/or other hydrocarbons produced from or allocated to any wells located or to be located on such lease which is less than the percentage share set forth on such Exhibit in connection with such lease in the column headed “NRI” or (ii) causes Seller to be obligated to bear a percentage share of the cost of operation of such well greater than the percentage share set forth on such Exhibit in connection with such lease in the column headed “WI”. 

^^Encumbrances. Seller’s ownership of the Interests is subject to an Encumbrance other than a Permitted Encumbrance (as defined below); or 

^^Preferential Rights and Consents. Seller’s ownership of a Interests is subject to a preferential right to purchase such property or a requirement that consent to assignment of such property be obtained, unless Seller demonstrates to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction that a waiver of such right or consent, as applicable, has been obtained with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby or, in the case of a preferential right to purchase, an appropriate tender of the applicable interest has been made to the party holding such right and the period of time required for 

such party to exercise such right has expired without such party exercising such right; or 

^^Imperfections in Title. Seller’s ownership of Interest is subject to an imperfection in title which, if asserted by any Person, would cause a Title Defect, as defined in this section, to exist, and such imperfection in title is not such as would customarily be waived by prudent persons engaged in the oil and gas business. 

^^Title Dispute Resolution. The Parties shall attempt to initially resolve, through good faith negotiations, all disputes concerning the following matters: (i) the existence and scope of a Title Defect, and (ii) the adequacy of Seller’s Title Defect curative materials and Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction thereof (the “***Title Disputed Matters***”). In the event the Parties cannot resolve any Title Disputed Matters on or before the end of the Cure Period, then Seller shall have the right, with respect to each separate portion of the Interests, to resolve the Title Disputed Matters by arbitration as follows: (1) there shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an attorney with at least 10 years experience in oil and gas law in the State of Colorado, selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller, or absent such agreement, the arbitrator shall be selected (subject to the foregoing criteria) by the Denver, Colorado office of the Judicial Arbitration Group (the “***Arbitrator***”), (2) the arbitration proceeding shall be held in Denver, Colorado and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Assignment, (3) the Arbitrator’s determination shall be made within 20 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal, (4) in making the determination, the Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Agreement and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination, (5) the Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise on the matter, including without limitation petroleum engineers and environmental consultants, (6) the Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of resolving the Title Disputed Matters, and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter, (7) Buyer and Seller shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case, and (8) Buyer and Seller shall each bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Arbitrator. 

^^Permitted Encumbrances. As used herein, “Permitted Encumbrances” means (i) lessor’s royalties, overriding royalties, reversionary interests, rights or options to participate, and any similar or other burdens applicable to any of the Leases, if the effect of such burdens does not operate to reduce Buyer’s working interest in each of the Leases and Buyer’s net revenue interest in each of the Leases to less than shown on **Exhibit “A” AND Exhibit “A1”** attached; (ii) any and all federal, state, and local regulatory laws, orders and rules to which any of the Leases is presently subject provided such laws do not prohibit Seller from being able to acquire drilling permits and access permits to enable Seller access to the Leases; (iii) preferential rights to purchase and required consents and similar agreements with respect to which, Seller has shown to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction, (a) waivers or consents have been obtained prior to the Closing Date from the appropriate parties or (b) required notice has been given to the holder of the right and the appropriate time period for asserting the right has expired prior to the Closing Date without an exercise of the right; (iv) encumbrances relating to the Leases that secure payments to mechanics and material men or that secure payment of taxes or assessments that are, in either case, not yet 

delinquent (provided, however, Seller shall discharge such encumbrances as they become due and payable); (v) all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other actions by governmental entities in connection with the sale or conveyance of the Leases if they are customarily obtained subsequent to the sale or conveyance; (vi) easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, conditions existing on or below the surface, regulatory restrictions on drilling or operations, surface leases, surface use restrictions and other surface uses and impediments on, over, or in respect of the Leases, to the extent they do not materially interfere with the rights in or the use or operation of such Leases; (vii) terms and conditions of Lessor mortgages as long as such mortgages (a) are not delinquent or (b) the liens created by such mortgages have been subordinated to the working interests create by the Leases; or (c) the liens create by such mortgages secure amounts less than $[[USD Value 4: Number]]; (viii) liens securing current Property Taxes; (ix) all other liens, charges, encumbrances, contracts, agreements, subordination, instruments, obligations, defects and irregularities affecting the Leases that do not (or would not upon foreclosure or other enforcement) (a) reduce Buyer’s working interest in each of the Leases or reduce Buyer’s net revenue interest in each of the Leases to less than that shown on **Exhibit “A” AND Exhibit “A1”**, proportionately reduced to the oil and gas ownership interest purported to be covered by each Lease, (b) reduce the net mineral acres covered by the any of the Leases as set forth on attached **Exhibit “A” AND Exhibit “A1”**, or (c) materially interfere with or detract from the ownership, operation, value or use of the Leases. Such permissible defects under item (ix) include, without limitation, (A) those described by an attorney’s title opinion as advisory only and (B) defects that have clearly been cured by possession under applicable statutes of limitation, defects in the early chain of title such as failure to recite marital status in documents, omission of heirship or succession proceedings, lack of survey and failure to record releases of liens, production payments or mortgages that have expired of their own terms or which through the passage of time or by statute are clearly no longer enforceable or other defects that either as a practical matter have not resulted or are not likely to result in claims that will materially adversely affect Seller’s title based upon customary oil and gas title practice in the jurisdiction where the lands covered by the Leases are located.
