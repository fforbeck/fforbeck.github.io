Any fees charged by the Escrow Agent for its services hereunder shall not exceed One Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 3: Number]]) and shall be split evenly between Buyer and the Seller. 

^Inspection and Condition of the Property. 

^^Access to and Inspection of the Property. Subject to the rights of tenants and other occupants under Leases (“**Tenants**”), Buyer shall have the right until the later of thirty (30) days after the date of delivery to Buyer of all of the documents listed on *Exhibit 4(a)* or [[Date 4: Date]] (the “**Due Diligence Expiration Date**”) (such period being referred to herein as the “**Inspection Period**”) to enter upon and have access to the Property, upon reasonable notice to Seller (which may be oral), in order to conduct surveys, tests, examinations, appraisals and inspections thereof; provided, that, any intrusive testing shall require Seller’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall not make any subsurface soil examinations unless Buyer has satisfied Seller that such examinations will not adversely affect any building foundations and/or utilities. Prior to entering upon the Premise pursuant to this Section 4(a), Buyer shall provide to Seller evidence of Buyer’s general public liability insurance with policy limits of $[[USD Value 4: Number]] in personal injury coverage and $[[USD Value 5: Number]] in property damage coverage naming Seller and New Boston Management Services, Inc. as an additional insured. At Seller’s option, Seller or Seller’s agent may accompany and/or observe Buyer during Buyer’s due diligence undertakings at the Property. After having conducted such inspections and tests, Buyer shall immediately restore the Property to the same condition as existed prior to Buyer’s entry thereon, reasonable wear and tear and casualty not caused by Buyer excepted. Buyer may communicate with any tenant of the Property, without Seller’s prior written consent. Seller will provide Buyer with legible copies of all the documents listed on *Exhibit 4(a)* (not later than five (5) business days after the date hereof) which Buyer may review during the Inspection Period. Seller shall, during the Inspection Period, promptly provide, or make available, to Buyer in Seller’s office or on Seller’s electronic data site, financial records including income and expense records, invoices, accounts payable and accounts receivable reports from management, correspondence from and to Tenants, and other documents in Seller’s possession which relate to the Property upon reasonable request from Buyer in writing. IT IS THE PARTIES EXPRESS UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT THAT ALL SUCH MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED BY SELLER SOLELY FOR BUYER’S CONVENIENCE IN MAKING ITS OWN EXAMINATION AND DETERMINATION PRIOR TO THE DUE DILIGENCE EXPIRATION DATE AS TO WHETHER IT WISHES TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY, AND IN MAKING SUCH EXAMINATION AND DETERMINATION, BUYER SHALL RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON ITS OWN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION AND EVALUATION OF THE PROPERTY. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED EXPRESSLY IN THIS AGREEMENT SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION AS TO THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR RELEVANCY OF ANY MATERIALS PROVIDED BY SELLER. Subject to the rights of Tenants, Buyer, and Buyer’s prospective mortgagee, shall also have the right subsequent to the Due Diligence Expiration Date to enter upon and have access to the Property upon reasonable notice to Seller (which may be oral), in order to conduct surveys, approvals and inspections thereof; provided, however, Buyer shall have no right to terminate this Agreement as a result of any information or belief acquired at or in connection with such access and/or inspection subsequent to the Due Diligence Expiration Date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

^^Indemnification for Inspections. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller and Seller’s partners, employees, officers, agents, contractors, and representatives harmless from and against any lien, liability, loss, damage, claim, fee, cost or expense, including reasonable attorney’s fees, for the costs of such inspections, tests and investigations and for physical damage to property or bodily injury to persons to the extent it results from any such entry upon or inspection or testing of the Property by Buyer, or by any employee, officer, agent, contractor, representative or assignee of Buyer; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not be applicable to conditions discovered by Buyer, but not originally caused by Buyer, nor shall such indemnity extend to any lien, liability loss, damage, claim, fee, or expense caused by or arising out of the negligence of Seller or its agents. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason or delivery of the Deed, as applicable. 

^^Due Diligence Expiration. Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with or without reason in Buyer’s sole discretion by written termination notice to Seller received on or before the Due Diligence Expiration Date. If Buyer fails to deliver a written notice to Seller waiving its termination right hereunder on or before said date, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect, except as otherwise provided herein. Any such timely termination notice or automatic termination shall be sufficient for the Escrow Agent to return the Deposit with interest accrued thereon to Buyer forthwith. If Buyer does provide notice to Seller in accordance with this Section 4(c) that Buyer waives its termination rights, then Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any right pursuant to this Section 4(c), Buyer shall no longer be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4(c), and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. 

^^Notice of Code Violation. Seller does hereby agree to give to Buyer, promptly upon receipt, a copy of any written notice (the “**Governmental Violation** **Notice**”) which Seller receives prior to Closing from any governmental authority concerning a violation of any zoning or building or other code, law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or order which regulates the use of the Property. If said Governmental Violation Notice is received by Seller and delivered to Buyer on or before five (5) business days before the Due Diligence Expiration Date, then Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on account of said violation in accordance with Section 4(c) of this Agreement. If said Governmental Violation Notice is received by Buyer after five (5) business days before the Due Diligence Expiration Date but prior to the Closing Date, then, together with a copy of the Governmental Violation Notice, Seller shall give Buyer a written notice (the “**Seller’s Violation Cure Notice**”) stating that (i) Seller agrees to cure the violation identified in the Governmental Violations Notice, or (ii) Seller does not agree to, or cannot, cure the violation in the Governmental Violation Notice. If Seller gives Buyer notice that Seller will cure the violation identified in the Governmental Violation Notice, then Seller shall proceed with due diligence to effect such cure to the satisfaction of the entity citing such violation, and this transaction shall be closed on the Closing Date or such later date within twenty (20) days of the Closing Date as may be specified by Seller upon completion of such cure and Seller’s obligation to cure shall survive Closing. If Seller notifies Buyer that Seller cannot or will not cure the violation identified in the Governmental Violation Notice, then Buyer shall have the right, at its option, to take either of the following actions (x) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by written termination notice to Seller received by Seller within five (5) business days of delivery of Seller’s Violation Cure Notice; or (y) Buyer may proceed to close this transaction, in which event, Buyer shall waive Buyer’s objections and shall pay to Seller the full Purchase Price. If Buyer fails to respond timely to Seller’s Violation Cure Notice, then Buyer shall be deemed to waive any objection on account of such violation, Buyer shall no longer be entitled to terminate this Agreement as a result of such violation, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If Buyer receives a Governmental Violation Notice less than five (5) business days before the scheduled Closing Date, the Closing Date shall be extended at Buyer’s option, to the date that is five (5) business days after Buyer receives such notice. 

^^Condition of the Property. Except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement, Buyer is purchasing the Property AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS. Buyer shall rely solely upon its own review of documents and inspections with regard to the condition of the Property and the structural and mechanical systems of the improvements thereon, including, but not limited to, its location, size, subsurface or soil condition, construction and character; and, except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement, Buyer specifically agrees that it shall purchase and acquire the Property AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY BY SELLER WHATSOEVER, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AS TO THE TRUTH OR ACCURACY OF ANY DOCUMENTS SUPPLIED, AS TO THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY, OR AS TO ITS FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY SELLER.

This release shall survive the Closing. 

^Title Matters and Insurance. 

^^Title Commitment; Survey. Buyer shall obtain, at its own expense, from a nationally recognized title insurance company selected by Buyer (the “**Title Company**”), a commitment for title insurance with endorsements required by Buyer (the “**Commitment**”) for the issuance of an owner’s policy of title insurance on a standard ALTA form (the “**Policy**”) with respect to the Property. Buyer shall obtain, at Buyer’s expense, such survey of the Property as Buyer shall desire. Seller shall have no obligation to provide or pay for the Commitment, Policy or survey Buyer may decide to obtain. Seller has provided to Buyer, at Seller’s cost, a copy of the most recent survey of the Property in Seller’s possession, without any representation as to its accuracy. 

^^Title Matters and Encumbrances on Title. The Commitment shall show fee simple title to the Property in Seller, subject only to the following: (i) the standard exceptions for any owner’s policy, (ii) any recorded instruments or recorded title matters which affect the Property (items (i) and (ii) being herein referred to individually as a “**Title Encumbrance**”). Any Title Encumbrance which is approved or is deemed to be approved or waived by Buyer shall be a permitted exception or encumbrance on the title to the Property and shall be a “**Permitted Encumbrance**”. 

^^Title Objection Notice. On or before the Due Diligence Expiration Date, Buyer may give to Seller written notice (the “**Title Objection Notice**”) of any Title Encumbrance which is not acceptable to Buyer as a Permitted Encumbrance on the title to the Property (the “**Title Objection**”). Any Title Encumbrance affecting the 

Property not objected to in the Title Objection Notice from Buyer to Seller shall be deemed to be approved or waived by Buyer and shall be a Permitted Encumbrance. If Buyer fails to provide a Title Objection Notice timely to Seller, then Buyer’s right to object on account of title shall be deemed waived, and all Title Encumbrances shall be Permitted Encumbrances. 

^^Title Cure Notice. If Buyer timely provides to Seller a written Title Objection Notice, then, within five (5) days after the receipt of Buyer’s Title Objection Notice, Seller shall give to Buyer a written notice (the “**Title Cure Notice**”) stating that (i) Seller agrees to cure one or more of the defects identified in the Title Objection Notice on or before the Closing Date, or (ii) Seller does not agree to, or cannot, cure one or more of the defects identified in the Title Objection Notice; it being understood and agreed that Seller shall not be obligated to cure any defects. If Seller gives Buyer notice that Seller will cure any of the Title Objections, then this transaction shall be closed on the Closing Date unless Seller notifies Buyer that it cannot effect the cure before the scheduled Closing Date, in which event the Closing Date shall be extended for up to twenty (20) days to permit Seller to effect such cure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall be obligated to eliminate in connection with the Closing all mortgages and assignments of leases and rents, mechanic’s liens, tax liens, assessment liens, judgment liens, mortgage liens, and other similar exceptions to the title to the Property which affect Seller’s Interest (“**Monetary Encumbrances**”). Seller shall be entitled to use such portion of the Purchase Price as is necessary to pay off all such Monetary Encumbrances and any Title Objection that Seller agrees to cure. Buyer hereby acknowledges that any instruments evidencing the release or discharge of the Monetary Encumbrances shall be recorded at or after the Closing in accordance with standard conveyancing practice, so long as Title Company deletes them from the Policy at Closing. If Seller notifies Buyer that Seller will not, or cannot, remove any Title Objection, then Buyer shall have the right, at its option, to take either of the following actions (x) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by written termination notice to Seller received by Seller within five (5) business days of delivery of Seller’s Title Cure Notice, or (y) Buyer may proceed to close this transaction, in which event Buyer shall waive Buyer’s objections and shall pay to Seller the full Purchase Price. 

^^Survey Objection Notice. On or before the Due Diligence Expiration Date, Buyer may give to Seller written notice (the “**Survey Objection Notice**”) of any survey matter which will materially adversely affect Buyer’s use of the Property and which is not acceptable to Buyer (the “**Survey Objection**”). Any survey matter affecting the Property not objected to in the Survey Objection Notice from Buyer to Seller shall be deemed to be approved or waived by Buyer. If Buyer fails to provide a Survey Objection Notice timely to Seller, then Buyer’s right to object on account of survey matters shall be deemed waived. 

^^Survey Cure Notice. If Buyer timely provides to Seller a written Survey Objection Notice, then, within five (5) days after the receipt of Buyer’s Survey Objection Notice, Seller shall give to Buyer a written notice (the “**Survey Cure Notice**”) stating that (i) Seller agrees to cure one or more of the defects identified in the Survey Objection Notice on or before the Closing Date, or (ii) Seller does not agree to, or cannot, cure one or more of the defects identified in the Survey Objection Notice; it being understood and agreed that Seller shall not be obligated to cure any defects. If Seller gives Buyer notice that Seller will cure any of the Survey Objections, then this transaction shall be closed on the Closing Date unless Seller notifies Buyer that it cannot effect the cure before the scheduled Closing Date, in which event the Closing Date shall be extended for up to twenty (20) days to permit Seller to effect such cure. Seller shall be entitled to use such portion of the Purchase Price as is necessary to cure any Survey Objection that Seller agrees to cure. The Buyer hereby acknowledges that any instruments evidencing the cure of any Survey Objection shall be recorded at or after the Closing in accordance with standard conveyancing practice, so long as Title Company deletes them from the Policy at Closing. If Seller notifies Buyer that Seller will not, or cannot, remove any Survey Objection, then Buyer shall have the right, at its option, to take either of the following actions (x) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by written termination notice to Seller received by Seller within five (5) business days of delivery of Seller’s Survey Cure Notice, or (y) Buyer may proceed to close this transaction, in which event Buyer shall waive Buyer’s objections and shall pay to Seller the full Purchase Price. 

^^New Encumbrances. Buyer shall have the right to object to any Title Encumbrances or survey matters first occurring after the date of the Commitment or survey (each a “**New Encumbrance**”) that are not acceptable to Buyer, by giving written notice of the New Encumbrance to which Buyer is objecting at any time prior to Closing, but not later than five (5) business days after discovery of the same. If Buyer does not object to any New Encumbrance by giving timely written notice as herein provided, such New Encumbrance shall be a Permitted Encumbrance. In the event Buyer gives timely written notice of objection to any New Encumbrance as herein provided, the provisions of Section 5(d) or 5(f) shall apply with respect thereto as if set forth herein in full. If any New Encumbrance is a Monetary Encumbrance, Seller must satisfy same on or before the Closing subject to Section 5(d). 

^^Title and Survey Fees. Buyer shall pay for the title search and for all premiums to the Title Company attributable to the issuance of the Commitment and the Policy. Buyer shall also pay any premium, if any, attributable to special endorsements and affirmative coverages, and mortgagee’s policy of title insurance. Buyer shall pay all costs for any new or updated survey ordered by Buyer. 

^Tenants; Leases; and Service Contracts. 

^^Existing Tenants and Leases. Attached hereto and made a part hereof on *Exhibit B-1* is a current rent roll (the “**Rent Roll**”) for all Tenants. Seller agrees to provide an updated, certified Rent Roll at the Closing, accurate as of the Closing Date. During the Inspection Period and subsequent to the expiration of the Inspection Period, Seller shall not enter into any new leases, or amend, modify, extend, renew or terminate any existing leases without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being understood and agreed that if Buyer does not respond to Seller’s written request (made in accordance with the notice provisions of this Agreement and accompanied by the applicable documentation for which consent is sought) for consent to such a transaction within five (5) business days, Buyer’s consent shall be deemed given). In the event that Seller shall enter into any new lease, or amend, modify, extend or renew any lease, which Buyer has approved or deemed to have approved in accordance with this Section 6(a), all costs for tenant improvements and leasing commissions incurred in connection with any such transaction shall be pro-rated between Seller and Buyer based upon the portion of the new (or extended) lease term which falls within each party’s period of ownership. 

^^Tenant Estoppel. Seller shall obtain a tenant estoppel certificate from Home Depot U.S.A. Inc. (“**Home Depot**”) substantially in the form of *Exhibit 6(b)* (the “**Tenant Estoppel Certificate**”) prior to Closing, and it shall be a pre-condition to Buyer’s obligation to close that Seller has obtained said Tenant Estoppel Certificate and delivered it to Buyer at least [five (5)] business days prior to Closing. For purposes of satisfying this condition precedent, the Tenant Estoppel Certificate shall (i) be dated no more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, (ii) not disclose a monetary or other material default beyond any applicable cure period by the landlord or tenant, or a condition which, with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute a monetary or other material default by either landlord or tenant, under the applicable Lease, (iii) disclose no material inconsistencies or variations from the list of Leases shown on *Exhibit B*, the Rent Roll (*Exhibit B-1*), or the terms and provisions of the applicable Lease, and (iv) be substantially in the form of *Exhibit 6(b)* or in such other form as Buyer may approve in its sole discretion. 

^^Service Contracts. Seller shall cooperate reasonably with Buyer to obtain a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement (“**SNDA**”) from Home Depot in commercially reasonable form and acceptable to Buyer on or before the Closing Date, but such shall not be a condition of Closing; provided, however, that execution by Home Depot of the form of SNDA attached to its Lease shall be a condition of Closing for Buyer’s benefit. During the Inspection Period, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing which Service Contracts or Personal Property Leases Buyer will assume at Closing. Seller shall terminate as of the Closing Date, at no cost to Buyer, all Service Contracts or Personal Property Leases which Buyer has not elected to assume. All management and leasing agreements shall be terminated at Closing at Seller’s cost. 

^^Seller’s Covenants. Seller hereby covenants and agrees with Buyer that, after the date of this Agreement and until Closing: 

^^^Seller shall not enter into any Service Contracts, Personal Property Leases, easements or other matters affecting title which would continue for a period subsequent to the Closing Date without the prior written approval of Buyer, which consent may be withheld in Buyer’s sole discretion. 

^^^Seller will cause the Property to be maintained and operated in the same manner as it has previously been maintained and operated in all material respects. 

^^^Seller shall not cause or agree to any action that makes any of Seller’s representations set forth in this Agreement untrue. 

^^^Seller shall not collect rent for more than thirty (30) days in advance. 

^^^Seller shall replace any items of personal property or equipment owned by Seller that fail prior to the Closing Date with items of equivalent function and value. 

^^^Seller hereby agrees that from the date hereof until the Closing, it will maintain in full force and effect fire and extended coverage insurance upon the Property and public liability insurance with respect to damage or injury to persons or property occurring on the Property in such amounts and with deductibles as is maintained by Seller on the date of this Agreement. 

^^^Seller will take the Property off the market and not enter into any backup contracts so long as this Agreement continues in effect. 

^^^Seller will advise Buyer promptly of any litigation, arbitration or administrative hearing concerning or affecting the Property to which Seller is a party, or if any representation of Seller becomes untrue, of which Seller has actual knowledge or notice. 

^Leasing Commissions. Except as otherwise provided with respect to a Lease approved or deemed approved by Buyer pursuant to Section 6(a) above, Seller shall be responsible for all leasing commissions and tenant improvements, concessions or incentives, if any, which are attributable to the current term of the existing Home Depot Lease through [[Date 5: Date]] (the “**Home Depot Current Term**”) or attributable to any extension exercised prior to Closing. A true, accurate and complete list of Seller’s leasing brokers who have commissions becoming due after the Closing Date is attached hereto as *Exhibit 7* and made a part hereof. Buyer shall be responsible for any leasing commission which may become due and payable after the Closing Date with respect to any of the Leases including, extensions, renewals, modifications, expansions, and options exercised after Closing (the “**Post Original Term**”). Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from and against any liability, cost or expense, plus all costs of collection, including litigation expenses and attorneys’ fees, as a result of any claim for a leasing commission that has been incurred with respect to the Property for the Post Original Term. Seller hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from and against any liability, cost or expense, plus all costs of collection, including litigation expenses and attorney’s fees, as a result of any claim for tenant improvements, concessions or incentives or a leasing commission that has been incurred with respect to the Premises for the Home Depot Current Term, except as otherwise provided with respect to a Lease approved or deemed approved by Buyer pursuant to Section 6(a)(i) above. These indemnities shall survive delivery of the Deed. 

^Brokers. Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge that neither of them has dealt with a real estate broker in this transaction other than CB Richard Ellis, Inc. (“**Broker**”).

Each of Buyer and Seller does hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party from and against any liability, cost or expense, plus all costs of collection, including litigation expenses and attorneys’ fees, as a result of a claim for a commission, fee or other compensation made by any real estate broker, finder or other person and asserted against the other party by reason of an arrangement made or alleged to have been made by the indemnifying party. This indemnity shall survive termination of this Agreement for any reason or delivery of the Deed, as applicable. 

^Conditions of Closing. 

^^Buyer’s Conditions. The obligations and liabilities of Buyer hereunder shall in all respects be conditioned upon the satisfaction of each of the following conditions prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, any of which may be waived by written notice from Buyer to Seller. 

^^^Seller has complied with and otherwise performed in all material respects each of the covenants and obligations of Seller set forth in this Agreement.

^^^Buyer shall have received the Tenant Estoppel Certificate in the form provided for in Section 6(b) and the SNDA in the form provided for in Section 6(c). 

^^^In addition, it is a condition to Closing that Home Depot shall not have terminated, or given notice of intent to terminate, its Lease pursuant to the terms of such Lease. 

^^^The Title Company shall issue (or shall be prepared and irrevocably and unconditionally committed to issue) the Title Policy in form and content as required by Buyer.

If any condition specified in Section 9(a)(iii), (iv) or (vii) is not satisfied on or before the Closing Date, Buyer may, at its option, and in its sole and absolute discretion, extend the Closing Date to allow Seller a sufficient time (but not to exceed twenty (20) days) within which to cure or satisfy such condition, and Seller shall immediately commence prosecution of such cure or satisfaction and diligently pursue the same to completion, at which time a new Closing Date shall be scheduled on or before the 10th day after Buyer’s acceptance of such cure or satisfaction, or Buyer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect the remedies set forth in the following sentence. If any condition specified in Section 9(a)(i) through (viii) is not satisfied on or before the Closing Date, Buyer may, at its option and in its sole and absolute discretion, (a) waive any such condition which can legally be waived and proceed to Closing without adjustment or abatement of the Purchase Price, or (b) terminate this Agreement by written notice thereof to Seller, in which case the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer. In addition to (and notwithstanding) the foregoing, if the failure of the condition is due to a breach by Seller under this Agreement, Buyer may pursue any of its remedies under Section 15(d). 

^^Seller’s Conditions. The obligations and liabilities of Seller hereunder shall be conditioned upon Buyer performing in all material respects its obligation to close the transaction contemplated under this Agreement at the time and in the manner required under this Agreement, any of which may be waived by written notice from Seller to Buyer. 

In the event Seller shall terminate this Agreement as a result of the non-satisfaction of the foregoing condition, Seller shall be entitled to an immediate release of the Deposit and all accrued interest thereon from the Escrow Agent to Seller as Seller’s sole remedy, all as provided for in Section 15(c). 

^Closing Costs And Proration Credits. At the Closing, the following items shall be adjusted between Seller and Buyer effective as of the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date, with Buyer being deemed to own the Property on the Closing Date: 

^^Title Insurance Costs. Buyer shall pay the cost of the title insurance premium and fees as provided in Section 5.

^^Escrow Fees. Buyer and Seller shall each pay half of the fees for escrow services. 

^^Conveyance, Recording. Buyer shall pay all recording fees related to the purchase and finance of the Property. Seller shall pay all recording fees relating to clearing title and paying off and releasing all liens and Monetary Encumbrances and to Seller’s authority. The parties shall each pay one-half of the documentary stamp tax and the transfer tax. This provision shall survive delivery of the Deed. 

^^Taxes. The amount of any assessment which is a lien on the Property, and any outstanding real estate taxes will be pro-rated, between the parties, with Seller responsible for the period prior to the Closing Date and Buyer responsible for the period commencing on and after the Closing Date. Impact fees and special assessments imposed prior to the Closing Date for improvements already installed shall be paid off by Seller at Closing. This provision shall survive delivery of the Deed. 

^^Current Real Estate Taxes. The adjustment for current real estate taxes shall be based upon the number of days in the calendar year or property tax year, if different, in which the Closing occurs, namely, on a per diem basis, and based upon the actual amount of real estate taxes, if known at the time of Closing. If the actual amount of real estate taxes is not known at the time of the Closing, then the parties shall adjust the taxes based on the actual amount of real estate taxes for the prior year. Such prorations as described herein shall be re-adjusted by the parties as soon as the actual amount of taxes is known, upon presentation of reasonable evidence thereof. This provision shall survive delivery of the Deed. Fees and costs for resolution of the tax appeal for the most recent triennial valuation shall be prorated based on the portions of such three-year period falling before and after Closing. 

^^Rents Receivable. Current rents, or any other rental adjustments payable by Tenants for expenses relating to the Property, which have been received by Seller prior to the Closing Date, shall be prorated between the parties on a per diem basis, with Seller retaining amounts applicable to the period before the Closing Date and providing a credit to Buyer for the period on and after the Closing Date. No proration shall be made for rents delinquent as of the Closing Date (hereafter called the “**Delinquent Rents**”). Seller may collect Delinquent Rents subject to Section 10(i) below. Buyer shall have no liability to Seller for the Delinquent Rents and shall have no obligation to collect the Delinquent Rents. Delinquent Rents collected by Buyer from Tenants shall be applied first to current rents and other amounts owed by such tenant and then to Delinquent Rents. Any such amounts applicable to Delinquent Rents received by Buyer shall be promptly forwarded to Seller. In addition, Buyer shall be given credit at the Closing for any prepaid rents actually received by Seller prior to, and attributable to the period commencing on or after the Closing Date. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to deliver promptly to the other party, if and when received, any rent amounts and escalations which are due to the other party. This provision shall survive delivery of the Deed. 

^^Escalation Payments. The rental adjustments for increases in the operating expenses (including real estate taxes) of the Property or other operating charges which are payable by Tenants pursuant to the terms of their Leases (herein called “**Escalation Payments**”) shall be prorated effective as of Closing to the extent they have been received by Seller and adjusted in the same manner as rent to the extent not received. Any reconciliation of Escalation Payments made by tenant on an estimated basis shall be made directly between Buyer and such tenant, and Seller and Buyer shall work cooperatively to allocate any such reconciliation between their respective periods of ownership. If it is known at Closing that Seller has collected amounts greater than those Home Depot will owe for taxes, operating expense or other pass-through amounts, the excess collected shall be credited to Buyer at Closing. This provision shall survive delivery of the Deed. 

^^Delinquent Rent Claims. If, on the Closing Date, there should be one or more claims for rent past due (herein called “**Delinquent Rent**”) from one or more Tenants or former tenants of the Premises, then Seller reserves the right, and retain its claims, to collect and keep such Delinquent Rent. Seller shall be entitled to receive, and may sue any former tenant to recover, any such Delinquent Rent; provided that Seller shall not commence any action to evict or eject Tenants from the Premises; nor shall Seller cause any liens to be filed against any tenant’s leasehold estate on account of any such claim or collection action, without the prior written approval of Buyer. Any rents received by Buyer from Tenants after the Closing Date shall first be applied to amounts currently due and then to back due rents. Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller any rent from former tenants or Tenants for the period prior to the Closing Date which are due to Seller in accordance with the terms hereof, although Buyer shall not be obligated to collect the same. This provision shall survive delivery of the Deed. 

^^Tenant Security Deposits. The amount of all tenant security deposits, if any, which Seller is obligated to return to Tenants in accordance with the terms of said Leases, shall be paid or credited to Buyer at the Closing whether or not Seller is actually holding them. In the event that any security deposit is in the form of a letter of credit or other instrument, any and all costs and fees associated with the assignment or transfer of the letter of credit to Buyer shall be the sole and exclusive responsibility of Seller. To effect such assignment or transfer, Seller shall provide, execute and deliver to Buyer at the Closing such instruments of assignment or transfer required pursuant to the terms of the applicable letter of credit or other instrument. Buyer does hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from and against any claim which may be asserted by a tenant for a security deposit that has been paid or credited to Buyer under this Agreement. This provision shall survive the delivery of the Deed. 

^^Operating Expense Charges. The amount of any gas, electric, water or other utility bill, the amount due on any Service Contract and any other operating expense relating to the Property and allocable to the period prior to the Closing Date shall be paid by Seller. To the extent applicable, Seller shall obtain final readings from the applicable utility providers effective as of the Closing Date and shall pay or credit to Buyer at Closing all utility charges owed by Seller for periods prior to Closing. If the amount of any utility bill, Service Contract or other operating expense charge cannot be determined for payment at Closing, or if it is allocable in part to the period preceding and in part to the period including and following the Closing Date, then it shall be treated and paid in the following manner: the amount of such charge shall be estimated based upon the prior billing period and prorated on a per diem basis; Seller’s proportionate share thereof shall be credited against the Purchase Price payable at the Closing; and the entire amount of the bill shall be paid by Buyer after the Closing, with the amount of such operating expenses so estimated, prorated and paid being adjusted post-closing as necessary. If Seller has made any deposit with a utility company, then Seller shall be entitled to have the same refunded to it immediately after the Closing, or credited at the Closing if the deposit is transferred to the Buyer. This provision shall survive delivery of the Deed. 

^^Seller shall complete and pay in full for any tenant improvements that are the landlord’s responsibility attributable to the Home Depot Current Term and shall credit to Buyer at Closing any rent credits, abatements or incentives applicable to the balance of such term. This provision shall survive delivery of the Deed. 

^^Proration of Other Revenue and Expense Items. The parties hereby agree that any other revenue and expense item, including management fees and superintendent costs which are received or incurred in respect of the Property, which is customarily prorated in a transaction of this nature and which is not otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement shall be prorated on a per diem basis effective as of the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date. This provision shall survive delivery of the Deed. 

^^Other Expenses. Except as may otherwise be provided in the Agreement, each party shall be responsible for all other fees, costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with this transaction, including, without limitation, any such expenses for services rendered by accountants, appraisers, architects, attorneys, consultants, contractors, engineers. 

^Closing Instruments. Seller shall be responsible for the preparation of all of the Closing Instruments specified in Section 11(a) and other provisions of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement. If the form of any Closing Instrument is not attached hereto, the parties shall agree upon such form and attach it during the Inspection Period. Ten (10) days prior to Closing, Buyer shall notify Seller of any assignment of Buyer’s interest in this Agreement as permitted by Sections 16(e) and 16(i) hereof so that the Closing Instruments can be prepared to reflect such assignment. If the Seller is not so notified, Seller shall prepare the Closing Instruments to the Buyer named herein.

If Buyer does not elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the previous sentence, or if the loss or damage would require an expenditure of less than Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 6]]), then the parties shall proceed to close this transaction in accordance with the terms hereof except that Buyer shall receive an assignment of any casualty loss insurance proceeds, if any, attributable to the loss or damage and Buyer shall receive a credit for the amount of the deductible and any self-insured or uninsured amount required under Seller’s policy (subject, as to both the insurance proceeds and the deductible, to a reduction equal to the amount if any expended by Seller to repair such loss or damage).

If Buyer does not elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the previous sentence, then the parties shall proceed to close this transaction; and in such event, Buyer shall have the right to negotiate with such governmental or other authority or to contest such appropriation in litigation proceedings, and shall be entitled to all proceeds thereof, which Seller shall assign to Buyer, and Seller shall convey the Property subject to such proceedings and shall receive therefor the Purchase Price in full at the Closing.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except for fraud or intentional misrepresentation, Buyer shall have no right to seek monetary damages unless its actual damages exceed $[[USD Value 7: Number]] and Seller’s liability under this Section 14 shall in no event exceed $[[USD Value 8: Number]] 

^^^Actual Knowledge Defined. Whenever the phrase “to the Seller’s actual knowledge” is used, it shall mean to the knowledge of Jon Gillman and John Thompson, without the requirement to make any investigation or inquiry.

^^Buyers’ Representation and Warranties. Buyer hereby makes the following representations and warranties to Seller as of the date hereof and as of the date of the Closing: 

^^^Organization and Authority. Buyer has been duly organized and is validly existing under the laws of Delaware. Buyer has the full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate or cause to be consummated the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The person signing this Agreement on behalf of Buyer is authorized to do so. No consent or approval of any person or entity or of any governmental authority is required with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer or, except for approval by Buyer’s board, for the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby or the performance by Buyer of its obligations hereunder. Buyer intends to obtain its board’s approval during the Inspection Period, and, if Buyer does not terminate this Agreement during the Inspection Period, Seller shall be entitled to assume that such approval was obtained. Buyer has complied with and otherwise performed in all material respects each of the covenants and obligations of Buyer set forth in this Agreement. 

^^^Pending Actions. To Buyer’s actual knowledge, there is no action, suit, arbitration, unsatisfied order or judgment, government investigation or proceeding pending against Buyer which, if adversely determined, could individually or in the aggregate interfere with the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 

^^^Bankruptcy. There is not pending any case, proceeding or other action seeking organization, arrangement, adjustments, liquidation, dissolution or recomposition of Buyer under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or the relief of debtors, or seeking the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or similar official for the Buyer. 

^^^Patriot Act. Neither Buyer nor any party who has invested any money in or with Buyer, except third-party persons who hold direct or interest ownership interests in Buyer, or has loaned any money to Buyer (“**Buyer’s Constituents**”) is on the list of “Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons” maintained by the United States Treasury under the Executive Order or is a Prohibited Person. Buyer has provided, and will after the Closing provide if required, such information and certifications as Seller may reasonably require to establish that Buyer and all Buyer’s Constituents, except third-party persons who hold direct or interest ownership interests in Buyer, are parties with whom Seller may lawfully perform Seller’s obligations under this Agreement in compliance with Executive Order. 

^Voluntary Termination; Default; Remedies. 

^^Voluntary Termination; Release of Liability. If this Agreement is voluntarily terminated by a party pursuant to a right of termination expressly provided in this Agreement, then both parties shall, upon such voluntary termination, be automatically released from all further obligations and liability under this Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein, and the Deposit and interest accrued thereon shall be returned to Buyer. 

^^Default. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute a breach of a promise or obligation undertaken and thus a default by a party under this Agreement: (i) failure to close at the time and manner required under this Agreement, (ii) if any representation or warranty made by a party in or pursuant to this Agreement was not true, correct, complete and accurate in any material respect as of the time it was made and the same is not waived by the other party, or (iii) if any other promise or obligation undertaken by a party under this Agreement has not been performed within the time period specified in this Agreement, or if no such time period has been so specified, within a period of five (5) days after the other party has given to the non-performing party written notice of such event. 

^^Seller’s Remedies. If a default by Buyer has occurred as provided in Section 15(b)(i) and is not waived by Seller, then, in such event, Seller shall have the right (i) to terminate this Agreement by giving Buyer written notice of such termination, and (ii) to retain the Deposit together with interest thereon as Seller’s sole and exclusive right at law and in equity which shall be considered to be the equivalent of, and shall constitute, the payment of liquidated damages, with the amount of the Deposit and its payment being agreed upon by the parties as being a reasonable approximation of actual damages, including compensation to Seller for removing the Property from the market and reimbursement for the costs and expenses incurred by Seller; and such application and disposition shall constitute a complete release of each party from its liability under this Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein. 

^^Buyer’s Remedies. If a default by Seller has occurred as provided in Section 15(b), then, in such event, Buyer shall have, as its sole and exclusive remedy at law and in equity, the right, at its option, to (x) obtain specific performance of this Agreement, and recover its costs and attorneys’ fees in obtaining the same, plus actual damages but no consequential, or punitive damages; or (y) terminate this Agreement by giving Seller written notice of such termination, in which event the Deposit and all interest thereon shall be returned to Buyer, and Buyer shall be reimbursed by Seller for verifiable third party due diligence, financing and acquisition costs not to exceed 

$[[USD Value 9: Number]] plus attorneys’ fees and costs to recover the same; or (z) waive the default or other closing condition and proceed to consummate the transaction in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If Buyer cannot obtain specific performance against Seller because Seller has transferred the Property or an interest therein to others, Buyer shall be entitled to obtain its actual and consequential damages not to exceed $[[USD Value 10: Number]] (but no punitive damages), and its attorneys’ fees and costs. 

^^Seller shall place in escrow at Closing with Escrow Agent and under instructions reasonably acceptable to Buyer, Seller and Escrow Agent, in a form agreed upon at least five (5) business days before Closing, the sum of $[[USD Value 11: Number]] to assure Buyer that funds are available to pay any post-closing liabilities of Seller under this Agreement. Said escrow shall continue for the Survival Period, unless Buyer has given Seller written notice of a claim of breach by Seller under this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Survival Period, in which event the Escrow shall continue with respect to such claim until such time as (a) such claim has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction resulting in a final, non-appealable judgment (or, alternatively, the party entitled to appeal any judgment has waived the right to do so in writing, or (b) such claim has been settled pursuant to a written settlement agreement between Buyer and Seller, at which time any funds remaining in escrow shall be disbursed to Seller after payment of Escrow Agent’s fees and costs. 

^General and Miscellaneous Provisions. 

^^Notice. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be given to a party under this Agreement shall be in writing, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, and shall be given by one of the following methods to such party at the address set forth at the end of this provision.

^^Complete Agreement; Amendment; Waiver; Counterparts. This Agreement, including the Preliminary Statements and all attached exhibits, constitute the complete and integrated agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous negotiations and understandings, if any, between the parties; no oral or implied understanding, representation or warranty shall vary its terms. This Agreement may not be amended other than by a written instrument executed by the parties. Waivers must be in writing and signed by the party giving the waiver.

Except for the Closing Instruments, documents and notices delivered under this Agreement by pdf, email or telefacsimile will be accepted as originals. Each party will promptly provide originals upon request. 

^^Governing Law. This Agreement, the Closing Instruments and any other applicable document, including all of the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties thereunder, shall be governed, construed and enforced for all purposes in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, which is where the Property is located, without regard to its conflicts of laws and rules. Venue for any litigation under this Agreement shall be in the court in the State of Maryland having jurisdiction over the Property. 

^^Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, the Closing Instruments or any other applicable document should be held by a court to be invalid or unenforceable in any particular respect, then the remaining provisions of such document (or the same provision in any other respect) shall not be invalid, unenforceable, impaired or otherwise affected, but shall continue to be in full force and effect; and to this end, all such provisions are hereby declared to be severable. 

^^Successors and Assigns; Assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. In general, Buyer shall not have the right to assign this Agreement or any interest herein without the prior written consent of Seller; provided, however, Buyer shall have the right to assign this Agreement to an affiliate which the Buyer controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, without Seller’s prior written consent but such assignment and the assumption by such assignee of Buyer’s obligations hereunder shall not release Buyer from its obligation or liability hereunder unless Seller shall have specifically agreed to the same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such assignment shall be void unless Buyer notifies Seller of such assignment on the earlier of (i) ten (10) days from the date of the assignment, or (ii) ten (10) business days prior to the Closing. Seller shall have no right to assign this Agreement or any interest herein without Buyer’s prior written consent, which may be withheld for any or no reason, provided, however, that Seller may give to an institutional lender a collateral assignment of this Agreement to secure Seller’s obligations to such lender. Furthermore, either Seller and/or Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement to a “qualified intermediary” in order to facilitate, at no cost or expense to the other, a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code; provided, however, that (i) such assignment to a qualified intermediary shall not relieve either party of its respective obligations hereunder; and (ii) if Seller notifies Buyer that Seller has assigned its rights under the Agreement to a qualified intermediary, Buyer will be deemed to have satisfied Buyer’s payment obligation if Buyer instructs Title Company to wire proceeds to the qualified intermediary or to any other entity as instructed by Seller.

^^Time. Time is of the essence with respect to the performance of each provision of this Agreement. 

^^Confidentiality.

Notwithstanding anything contained in any such assignment, Buyer shall not by execution of this Agreement or by participation in any such exchange (i) have its rights under this Agreement affected or diminished in any manner, (ii) be required to undertake any obligations of third parties, or (iii) be responsible for compliance nor be deemed to have warranted to the Seller whether such exchange in fact complies with Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.

\centered **CERTIFICATION OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS** 

\centered **ENTITY TRANSFEROR** 

1445 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform the transferee that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by [[Seller]], Jr., and [[Party 3]], Trustees of the HAGERSTOWN NOMINEE TRUST, under Declaration of Trust dated [[Date 2]] and recorded with the Suffolk County, Massachusetts, Registry of Deeds at Book 31900, page 198 (the “**Trust**”), the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of Transferor: 

^Neither Transferor nor the Trust is a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Income Tax Regulations);

^The Trust is a disregarded entity as defined in Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii);

^Transferor’s U.S. employer identification number is [To be provided] ; and

^Transferor’s office address is 60 State Street, Suite 1500, Boston, Massachusetts 02109-1803.

Transferor and the Trust understand that this certification may be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service by transferee and that any false statement contained herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment or both. 

Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this certification, and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct, and complete, and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on behalf of Transferor and the Trust.
