^**Condemnation or Casualty**.  
^- Purchase and Sale Agreement

Seller will promptly notify Buyer as to the commencement of any such action or any communication from a condemning authority that a condemnation or appropriation is contemplated, and will cooperate with Buyer in the response to or defense of such actions.

^^**Condemnation Not Material**. If the condemnation is not Material, then the Closing shall occur without abatement of the Purchase Price and, after deducting Seller's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in collecting any award, Seller shall assign, without recourse, all remaining awards or any rights to collect awards to Buyer on the Closing Date.

^^**Casualty Not Material**. If the casualty is not Material, then the Closing shall occur without abatement of the Purchase Price except for a credit in the amount of the applicable deductible and Seller shall not be obligated to repair such damage or destruction and Seller shall assign, without recourse, and turn over to Buyer all of the insurance proceeds net of any costs of repairs and net of reasonable collection costs (or, if such have not been awarded, all of its right, title and interest therein) payable with respect to such fire or such casualty including any rent abatement insurance for such casualty.

^^**Materiality**. For purposes of this Section 15 with respect to a taking by eminent domain, the term "Material" shall mean any taking whatsoever, regardless of the amount of the award or the amount of the Property taken, excluding, however, any taking solely of (x) subsurface rights or takings for utility easements or right of way easements, if the surface of the Property, after such taking, may be used in the same manner, as reasonably determined by Buyer, as though such rights had not been taken, or (y) one lease of less than [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the rentable square feet for a term of less than five years, and (ii) with respect to a casualty, the term "Mate rial" shall mean any casualty such that (x) the cost of repairs are greater than $[[USD Value 9: Number]] or (y) a tenant occupying more than 2,000 s.f. of gross leasable area of the Property has the right under its lease to terminate such lease due to such casualty.

^**Legal and Equitable Remedies.**  
^^**Default by Seller**. In the event that the transaction fails to close by reason of any default by Seller, Buyer may elect, as the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer, to (i) terminate this Agreement and receive the Earnest Money from the Title Company, and in such 

^- Purchase and Sale Agreement    
event Seller shall not have any liability whatsoever to Buyer hereunder other than expressly surviving the Closing or (ii) enforce specific performance of Seller’s obligations under this Agreement, without adjustment to, or credit against, the Purchase Price. Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement (as provided in subsection (i) above) if Buyer fails to deliver to Seller written notice of its intent to file a cause of action for specific performance against Seller on or before thirty (30) days after written notice of termination from Seller or thirty (30) days after the originally scheduled Closing Date, whichever shall occur first, or having given Seller notice, fails to file a lawsuit asserting such cause of action within sixty (60) days after the originally scheduled Closing Date. Seller shall only be in default or breach under this Agreement, if Seller has failed to cure a default hereunder within three (3) business days from Seller’s receipt of Buyer’s written notice to cure such breach.

^^**Default by Buyer**. In the event that this transaction fails to close by reason of any default by Buyer, all Earnest Money shall be forfeited by Buyer and released from escrow to Seller, which shall be Seller’s sole and exclusive remedy on account of Buyer’s default. Buyer shall only be in default or breach under this Agreement, if Buyer has failed to cure a default hereunder within three (3) business days from Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s written notice to cure such breach.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, IF THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY IS NOT CONSUMMATED BY REASON OF A DEFAULT BY BUYER HEREUNDER AFTER SELLER HAS GIVEN BUYER NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 16.2 ABOVE, THEN BUYER SHALL HAVE NO FURTHER RIGHT TO PURCHASE ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE PROPERTY FROM SELLER, AND SELLER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FROM BUYER THE EARNEST MONEY AS SELLER’S LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICABLE AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FIX THE ACTUAL DAMAGES SUFFERED BY SELLER AS A RESULT OF BUYER’S FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, BUYER DESIRES TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES FOR WHICH BUYER MIGHT BE LIABLE SHOULD BUYER BREACH THIS AGREEMENT, AND SELLER DESIRES TO AVOID THE COSTS AND LENGTHY DELAYS THAT WOULD RESULT IF SELLER WERE REQUIRED TO FILE A LAWSUIT TO COLLECT ITS DAMAGES FOR A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT. THEREFORE, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVIDED FOR HEREIN REPRESENT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE DAMAGES WHICH SELLER WILL INCUR AS A RESULT OF SUCH FAILURE, AND SHALL BE SELLER’S SOLE REMEDY, EXCEPT FOR BUYER’S OBLIGATIONS TO INDEMNIFY SELLER AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH SHALL REMAIN REMEDIES OF SELLER IN ADDITION TO LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PAYMENT OF SUCH LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS NOT INTENDED TO BE AND SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A FORFEITURE OR PENALTY, BUT IS INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE AND REPRESENT LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO SELLER PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE §§ 1671 AND 1677. BY PLACING THEIR INITIALS BELOW, EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY CONFIRMS THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS SECTION AND THE FACT THAT SUCH PARTY WAS REPRESENTED
