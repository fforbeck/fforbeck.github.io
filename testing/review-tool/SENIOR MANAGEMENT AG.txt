\centered **SENIOR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**

THIS SENIOR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (this “**Agreement**”) is effective as of [[Date 1: Date]] (the “**Effective Date**”), among LECG CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the “**Company**”), and Steve M. Samek (the “**Executive**”).

\centered **Recitals**

^The Company has been organized for the purpose of engaging, through one or more subsidiaries, in the business of providing independent expert testimony, financial advisory services, original authoritative studies, strategic advisory, and tax, assurance, and business consulting services. The Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the “**LECG Entities**”, and any one of them is referred to as an “**LECG Entity**”.

^The Company desires to employ Executive, and the Executive wishes to accept such employment, as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

\centered **Agreement**

In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and promises contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

1.**Employment**. The Company hereby engages the Executive to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Executive agrees to serve the Company in such capacity subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

^^**Services**. The Executive, as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, shall have all the duties and responsibilities customarily rendered by similarly situated individuals employed by companies of similar size and nature and as may be delegated to him from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company.

^^**Best Efforts**. The Executive will devote his best efforts and such business time and attention as may be necessary (except for vacation periods and periods of illness or other incapacity) to perform the Services, and such management tasks and requirements as may be requested by the Company and LECG.

2.**Board of Directors**. For as long as Executive’s employment as Chief Executive Officer continues, the Company will continue to nominate Executive for election by the Company’s stockholders to the Company’s Board of Directors (the “**Board**”).

3.**Salary, Bonus and Benefits**.

^^**Salary**. In consideration of the services provided by the Executive hereunder, the Company will pay the Executive a base salary at the rate of Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars 

($[[USD Value 1: Number]]) per year (the “**Base Salary**”), retroactive to [[Date 2: Date]]. The Base Salary will be subject to review on an annual basis by the Board.

^^**Target Bonus**. The Executive shall be eligible to receive an annual bonus of up to seventy-five percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of Base Salary (“**Annual Bonus**”). The Annual Bonus shall initially be based [[Percentage 2: Number]]% on Company financial performance metrics and [[Percentage 3: Number]]% on individual performance metrics determined by the Board on an annual basis. The Executive and the Compensation Committee will work to establish the Company financial performance metrics and individual performance metrics for calendar year 2010, which proposed metrics the Compensation Committee will present to the Board for consideration at its next regular meeting. The relative balance between Company financial performance metrics and individual performance metrics may be altered by the Board for calendar years after 2010 in conjunction with the Board’s consideration of overall bonus compensation arrangements for senior executives of the Company. The Annual Bonus shall not be considered earned or payable for any calendar year unless the Executive remains actively employed by the Company through [[Date 3: Date]] of the calendar year immediately following such calendar year.

^^**Determination of Bonus; Payment**. Following the end of each calendar year, the Compensation Committee of the Board and the Chairman of the Board (the “**Chairman**”) shall together review Executive’s performance, and recommend to the Board for its final determination the amount of the Annual Bonus that Executive has earned based upon the applicable metrics for that year. The Board will base its determination of the Company’s achievement of financial performance metrics on the Company’s audited financial statements for such year, unless the Board determines that some other basis is appropriate. The attainment of individual performance metrics will be assessed by the Board in its sole discretion, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Compensation Committee and the Chairman.

^^**Restricted Shares**. Subject to the terms set forth in the Company’s 2003 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the “**Plan**”), and as the same may be amended from time to time, the Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable grant to the Executive one million (1,000,000) shares of Restricted Stock (as defined in the Plan) (the “**Restricted Shares**”), which Restricted Shares shall be subject to vesting as set for the below on the first five anniversaries of the date of grant (each an “**Anniversary Date**”).

The provisions of this Section 7 shall qualify and supersede all other provisions of this Agreement as necessary to fulfill the foregoing intent. If the Company believes, at any time, that any of such reimbursement, payment or benefit is not exempt or does not so comply, the Company shall promptly advise the Executive and shall reasonably and in good faith amend the terms of such arrangement such that it is exempt or complies (with the most limited possible economic effect on the Executive and on the Company) or to minimize any additional tax, interest and/or penalties that may apply under Section 409A if exemption or compliance is not practicable. The Company agrees that it shall not, without the Executive’s prior written consent, knowingly take any action, or knowingly refrain from taking any action, other than as required by law, that would result in the imposition of tax, interest and/or penalties upon the Executive under Section 409A, unless such action or omission is pursuant to the Executive’s written request.

^^**Separation Pay Plan/Short-Term Deferrals**. To the extent applicable, any Severance Benefits that become payable pursuant to Section 4.4.4 of this Agreement are intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) (Separation Pay Plan) and/or Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (Short-Term Deferrals).

^^**Compliance with Specified Employee Six-Month Delay Rule**.

^^**Application of Section 409A**. Except to the extent any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement does not constitute Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit (as defined in Section 409A) to the Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or provided as in-kind benefits to the Executive in any other calendar year (subject to any lifetime and other annual limits provided under the Company’s health plans), (ii) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Executive is entitled shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred and (iii) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.

^^**Separate Payments**. To the extent applicable, each and every payment to be made pursuant to Section 3.4.4 of this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment and not as one of a series of payments treated as a single payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii).

^^**Choice of Law; Dispute Resolution**. All questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this Agreement and the exhibits hereto will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Except with respect to any action seeking temporary or permanent injunctive relief taken in connection with the enforcement of Sections 4.5 through 4.11 and Section 5 of this Agreement, any controversy, dispute, or claim of whatever nature arising out of, in connection with, or in relation to the interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement, including any claim based on contract, tort, or statute, shall be resolved at the request of any party to this agreement, by final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator jointly selected by the parties. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the then-existing rules for the resolution of employment disputes of the American Arbitration Association or its successor entity, and judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any state or federal Court having jurisdiction thereof. The prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in enforcing this Agreement through arbitration or otherwise and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in appealing or enforcing any judgment entered by the arbitrator in any court having jurisdiction.

The Executive agrees to cooperate in any medical or other examination, supply any information, and to execute and deliver any applications or other instruments in writing as may be reasonably necessary to obtain and constitute such insurance.

^**General Release of Claims****.** For valuable consideration, that being the “Severance Benefits” described in Section 4.4.4 of the Senior Management Agreement, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the undersigned (the “Executive”) does hereby on behalf of the Executive and the Executive’s successors, assigns, heirs and any and all other persons claiming through the Executive, if any, and each of them, forever relieve, release, and discharge the Company and its respective predecessors, successors, assigns, owners, attorneys, representatives, affiliates, direct and indirect subsidiaries (whether or not wholly-owned), divisions, partners and their officers, directors, agents, employees, servants, executors, administrators, accountants, investigators, insurers, and any and all other related individuals and entities, if any, and each of them (collectively, the “Released Parties”), in any and all capacities from any and all claims, debts, liabilities, demands, obligations, liens, promises, acts, agreements, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees), damages, actions and causes of action, of whatever kind or nature, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any claims arising out of, based upon, or relating to the hire, employment, remuneration, or termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company.

^**Acknowledgment of Accrued Obligations****.** The Executive acknowledges that he has been paid all Accrued Obligations owed under the Senior Management Agreement, and that he is owed no other compensation for the Services provided under the Senior Management Agreement. The Executive understands that he is not required to sign this General Release and Agreement to receive the Accrued Obligations.

^**Inclusion of Employment and Other Claims in General Release****.** This General Release and Agreement (“Release”) includes a release of any rights or claims the Executive may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which prohibits age discrimination in employment as to individuals forty years of age and older; the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, which prohibits employers from denying benefits to older employees; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on race, color, national origin, religion or sex; any state or local law (including without limitation the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act and/or the Philadelphia Fair Practices Ordinance) that prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religious creed, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sex, pregnancy-related condition, marital status, age , sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic; the Equal Pay Act, which prohibits paying men and women unequal pay for equal work; the American with Disabilities Act, as amended, which prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities; and any other federal, state or local laws or regulations which prohibit employment discrimination, restrict an employer’s right to terminate the Executive, or otherwise regulate employment. This Release also includes a release by the Executive of any claims for or relating to breach of contract, wrongful discharge, status as a whistleblower, and all claims for alleged physical or personal injury, or emotional distress relating to or arising out of the Executive’s employment with the Company or the termination of that employment; and all claims under the Employee 

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, such as claims relating to pension or health plan benefits. This Release is not intended to and does not seek to waive the Executive’s rights to notice and otherwise under the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq. (“WARN”) or any similar law, as applicable, nor is the Executive required to execute the Release to receive that portion of the Severance Benefits provided under the Senior Management Agreement that constitutes “Paid Leave in Lieu of Notice” under WARN or any applicable state worker protection law.

^**Status of Claims That May Not Be Waived**. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Release, this Release does not apply to any rights or claims that arise after the execution of this Release, nor does it apply to any claims that may not by law be released in a private agreement between an employer and employee.

^**Release of Unknown Claims and Waiver of Any Legal Doctrine Precluding the Same**. This Release covers both claims that the Executive knows about and those the Executive may not know about as of the date of Executive’s execution of this Release. The Executive expressly waives all rights afforded by any statute or any legal doctrine that limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown claims. Executive understands the significance of the Executive’s release of unknown claims and the Executive’s waiver of any protection against a release of unknown claims. Executive expressly acknowledges that this Release is intended to include both claims that the Executive knows about and those the Executive does not know or suspect to exist as of the date of his execution of this Release.

^**Warranty with Respect to Pending Claims**. The Executive hereby represents and warrants that he has not filed, initiated, or prosecuted (or caused to be filed, initiated, or prosecuted) any lawsuit, complaint, charge, action, compliance review, investigation, or proceeding with respect to any claim this Release purports to waive, and the Executive covenants never to do so in the future, whether as a named plaintiff, class member, or otherwise. The Executive understands that this Release does not require him to withdraw, or prohibit him from filing, a charge with any government agency (such as the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), as long as the Executive does not personally seek reinstatement, damages, remedies, or other relief as to any claim that the Executive released by signing this Release, as the Executive has waived any right the Executive might have had to any of those things. If the Executive is ever awarded or recovers any amount as to a claim the Executive purported to waive in this Release, the Executive agrees that the amount of the award or recovery shall be reduced by the amounts he was paid as Severance Benefits under the Senior Management Agreement, increased appropriately for the time value of money, using an interest rate of [[Percentage 4]]% per annum. The Executive covenants never directly or indirectly to bring or participate in an action against any Released Party under any unfair competition law of any jurisdiction.

^**Dispute Resolution**. Except for claims by either the Executive or the Company for emergency equitable or injunctive relief which cannot be timely addressed through arbitration and are needed to preserve the parties’ rights pending arbitration, the Executive and the Company hereby agree to submit any claim or dispute between them and any of the Released Parties who agree to participate in arbitration, including those arising out of the terms of this Release, the Senior Management Agreement and/or any dispute arising out of or relating to the Executive’s employment with the Company, to private and confidential arbitration by a single neutral arbitrator to be mutually selected by the parties. The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the then-current rules of the American Arbitration Association governing employment disputes, and shall take place in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, which the Executive represents is a convenient location for the Executive. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties to this Release and any of the Released Parties who agrees to arbitration, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The Company and the Executive shall each pay one-half of the total fees payable to the arbitrator as such fees come due in connection with any claim or dispute subject to this paragraph, except as otherwise required by law; provided, however, that such fees and all other costs of the arbitration proceeding or litigation to enforce this Release, including attorneys’ fees and witness expense fees, shall ultimately be paid as the arbitrator or court awards in accordance with applicable law. Except for claims for emergency equitable or injunctive relief in aid of an ongoing arbitration claim, this arbitration procedure is intended to be the exclusive method of resolving any claim relating to the obligations set forth in this Release or the Senior Management Agreement. The Parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial on any dispute or claim covered by this Release.

^**Severability and Interpretation**. The provisions of this Release are severable, and if any part of this Release is found to be unenforceable, the other provisions shall remain fully valid and enforceable. This Release shall be construed in accordance with its fair meaning and in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof.

^**Advisements Under the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act**. The Executive is strongly encouraged to consult with an attorney before signing this Release. The Executive acknowledges that, by this Release, he has been advised to consult an attorney and the Executive understands that whether to do so is the Executive’s decision. The Executive acknowledges that he has 21 days(1) in which to consider whether the Executive should sign this Release and he acknowledges if he signs this Release, he has 7 days following the date on which he signs this Release to revoke it, and that this Release will not be effective until after this 7-day period had lapsed. To be effective, revocation must be made by written notice of revocation signed by the Executive and actually received by the Company on or before the seventh day after the Executive signs this Release. If the Executive revokes this Release, it shall not be effective or enforceable and the Executive shall not receive any of the Severance Benefits described in the Senior Management Agreement and will be required to repay any such benefits already paid to him or on his behalf. The Executive understands that any claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., that may arise after the date this Release is executed by the Executive are not waived.

^To be extended to 45 days to the extent required by applicable law.
