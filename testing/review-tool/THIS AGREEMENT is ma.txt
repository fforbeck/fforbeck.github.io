**Clause 2 (Sale and Purchase of the Shares)**

^^The wording in clause 2.3(a) of the SPA shall be deleted and replaced with the following:

*“subject to clause 2.3A, US$[[USD Value 1: Number]] billion payable in cash to the Seller at Completion (the “****Cash Consideration****”);”*

^^A new clause 2.3A shall be added to the SPA in the form set out below:

*“If the Seller subscribes or is required to subscribe for Prudential subordinated notes pursuant to the Standby Subordinated Note Commitment Letter, dated as of May* *2010, among Prudential, the Parent and the Seller (the “****Subordinated Note Commitment Letter****”), the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate nominal value of the subordinated notes for which the Parent or the Seller subscribes or is required to subscribe, and as a component of the consideration for the Shares, there shall be allotted and issued to and subscribed for by the Seller at Completion the subordinated notes which it subscribes or is required to subscribe for pursuant to the Subordinated Note Commitment Letter. If all or any part of the aggregate nominal value of the subordinated notes for which the the Seller subscribes or is required to subscribe is denominated in a currency other than US dollars, such amount shall, for the purposes of this clause 2.3A, be converted to US dollars in accordance with clause 32 (on the basis that the Relevant Date shall be the Completion Date).”*

^^The wording in clause 2.4 of the SPA shall be deleted and replaced with the following:

*“Subject as set out in* *clause 2.4A**, the number of Purchaser Ordinary Shares referred to in* *clause 2.3(b)* *shall be such whole number as most nearly represents 11.3 per cent (the “**Relevant Percentage****”) of the issued ordinary share capital of the Purchaser immediately following Completion. The Relevant Percentage has been calculated by expressing as a percentage the result of dividing the notional Sterling value of the Consideration Shares (being £3.613 billion) (the “**Consideration Shares Value****”) by the sum of: (w) £15.257 billion, being the market capitalisation in Sterling of Prudential as at close of trading on the trading day immediately prior to the date of this agreement, (x)*

^^^^^ 
*less the value of the final dividend which is £0.343 billion (the “**Final Dividend****”), (y) plus £13.465 billion, being the expected gross proceeds in Sterling of the Rights Issue (the “****Expected Sterling Gross Proceeds****”) and (z) plus the Consideration Shares Value (such sum being the “**Denominator****”).”*

^^A new clause 2.4A shall be added to the SPA in the form set out below:

*“For the purpose of determining the number of Purchaser Ordinary Shares referred to in* *clause 2.3(b)**, the Relevant Percentage shall, if required, be re-calculated in the following circumstances and on the following basis:*

^^*if the actual Sterling gross proceeds of the Rights Issue (the “****Actual Sterling Gross Proceeds****”) differ from the Expected Sterling Gross Proceeds, the Relevant Percentage shall be re-calculated on the basis that the value to be inserted at* *clause 2.4(y)* *shall be the Actual Sterling Gross Proceeds rather than the Expected Sterling Gross Proceeds;*

^^*if, in the period between the Signing Date and Completion, Prudential issues further ordinary shares (other than pursuant to the Rights Issue or the Scheme of Arrangement), the Relevant Percentage shall be re-calculated on the basis that the Denominator shall be increased by the proceeds of issue of such ordinary shares (which, in the case of ordinary shares issued pursuant to a scrip dividend alternative, shall be deemed to be zero); and/or*

^^*if, in the period between the Signing Date and Completion, Prudential makes a distribution by way of dividend or share repurchase to some or all of its ordinary shareholders, the Relevant Percentage shall be re-calculated on the basis that the Denominator shall be reduced by the cash amount of such distribution (save that the only re-calculation that shall be carried out in respect of the Final Dividend shall be as described in paragraph (ii) below).*

*For the avoidance of doubt: (i) the Relevant Percentage shall be re-calculated in respect of any and all events of the types identified in (a), (b) and (c) above and (ii) the Relevant Percentage shall be re-calculated (in accordance with (b) and (c)) in order to reflect the outcome of the scrip alternative offered in respect of the Final Dividend (and so that the value to be inserted at* *clause 2.4(x)* *shall be the amount of cash actually paid to ordinary shareholders by Prudential in respect of the Final Dividend).”*

**Clause 8 (Conduct of business before Completion)**

^^Clause 8.3 of the SPA shall be deleted in its entirety.

^^The following wording shall be inserted as a new clause 8.3 in the SPA:

*“The parties acknowledge that the Seller and the Parent have provided to Prudential certain data relating to the financial performance of the AIA Group in the first quarter of 2010 (the “**Raw Data****”) in order to allow Prudential to calculate certain metrics (the “**Prudential Metrics****”) for inclusion in, inter alia, the Prudential Prospectus. Without prejudice to any responsibility which the Seller or the Parent may have for the Raw Data, the Purchaser and Prudential hereby agree that neither the Seller nor the Parent*

^^^^^ 
*shall have any liability to the Purchaser or Prudential arising out of or in connection with the calculation by Prudential of the Prudential Metrics on the basis of the Raw Data, the form or manner in which the Prudential Metrics may be presented or published by Prudential and/or any determination by Prudential that the disclosure of such metrics satisfies applicable legal and regulatory standards.*”

**Clause 16 (Lock-up)**

^^The following wording shall be inserted as a new sub-clause 16.2(h) in the SPA:

*“the creation, following Completion and subject as set out below, of any pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or similar security interest over the Purchaser Ordinary Shares or Mandatory Convertible Securities in favour of (i) the Federal Reserve Bank of [[Address 3: Address]](the “**FRBNY****”) pursuant to the Credit Agreement, dated [[Date 3: Date]], between the Parent and the FRBNY, and the Guarantee and Pledge Agreement, dated [[Date 3]], among the Parent, the FRBNY and the Guarantors party thereto, in each case as amended from time to time, or (ii) any other permitted third party lender or financing counterparty of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (a “**Lender****”) in connection with financing provided to the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on arm’s length terms, providing the FRBNY or such Lender, as appropriate, agrees to abide by the restrictions contained in clause 16.1 during the Lock-Up Period or Mandatory Convertible Securities Lock-up Period, as applicable, as if it were the Seller; provided, however, that (a) a Lender (or an Affiliate of a Lender) or the FRBNY may enter into transactions which would otherwise breach the restrictions contained in clause 16.1 if such transactions are entered into for the account of clients or in the ordinary course of its market activities and such transactions do not act as a hedge against, and are otherwise unrelated to, the securities subject to such pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or similar security interest and (b) upon default and enforcement by a Lender or the FRBNY, as the case may be, of any pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or similar security interest over any Purchaser Ordinary Shares or Mandatory Convertible Securities following failure of the borrower to repay when due the principal sum outstanding under, or to post when required any collateral in respect of, the relevant financing arrangement, the Lender or the FRBNY, as the case may be, will not be bound by any of the restrictions contained in clause 16.1 (x) to the extent necessary to allow it to recover what is due to it under such financing arrangement, (y) providing that the Lender or the FRBNY, as the case may be, shall be obliged to use all reasonable endeavours to maximise the proceeds of any sales of Purchaser Ordinary Shares or Mandatory Convertible Securities effected for that purpose and (z) providing that any such sales shall be carried out in consultation with brokers nominated by the Purchaser. The Parent shall give the Purchaser at least 10 Business Days’ advance written notice of the proposed creation of any pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or similar security interest as described above and shall afford the Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to satisfy itself that any Lender is a permitted lender or financing counterparty for the purposes of clause (ii) and that adequate arrangements are in place to ensure compliance by the FRBNY or the Lender with the restrictions contained in clause 16.1. A Lender shall be a permitted lender or financing counterparty for the purposes of clause (ii) if it is Citigroup Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., Bank of America Corporation or any other lender or financing counterparty approved in writing in advance by the Purchaser (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld). If so requested by the Purchaser, the Parent shall take such action (or procure that such action is taken) as may reasonably be*

^^^^^ 
*required to enforce the restrictions contained in clause 16.1 against the FRBNY or the relevant Lender. From May* *2010 to completion of the Rights Issue, the Parent shall not, and shall procure that none of its Subsidiaries shall, enter into any discussions with any potential Lender with regard to the creation of any pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or similar security interest over the Purchaser Ordinary Shares or Mandatory Convertible Securities. Subject to applicable Law and securities exchange rules, the Parent shall not, during the Lock-Up Period or Mandatory Convertible Securities Lock-up Period, make any announcement relating to any pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or similar security interest of or over any Purchaser Ordinary Shares or Mandatory Convertible Securities without first consulting with the Purchaser and giving the Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to comment on such announcement; and”*

^^The following wording shall be inserted as a new sub-clause 16.2(i) in the SPA:
