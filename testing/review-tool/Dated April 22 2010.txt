^^Subject to paragraph (c):

©Mallesons Stephen Jaques 10278545_8   Master Agreement 22 [[Date 2]]  

^^^a liability arising under or in connection with this agreement is limited to and can be enforced against a Trustee only to the extent to which it can be satisfied out of property of Trust Property out of which the Trustee is actually indemnified for the liability. This limitation of the Trustees’ liability applies despite any other provision of this agreement and extends to all liabilities and obligations of the Trustees in any way connected with any representation, warranty, conduct, omission, agreement or transaction related to this agreement; and

^^^the other parties to this agreement may not sue a Trustee in any capacity other than as responsible entity or trustee of MDT or Macquarie Blended Property Trust, as applicable, including seeking the appointment of a receiver (except in relation to property of MDT or Macquarie Blended Property Trust, as applicable) a liquidator, an administrator or any similar person to a Trustee or prove in any liquidation, administration or arrangement of or affecting a Trustee (except in relation to Trust Property).

^^Despite any other provision of this or any other agreement (including a deed or deed poll), paragraph (a) does not apply to any obligation or liability of a Trustee to the extent that it is not satisfied because under the constitution of the Trustee, or by operation of law, there is a reduction in the extent of the Trustee’s indemnification out of the assets of MDT or Macquarie Blended Property Trust, as applicable, as a result of the Trustee’s fraud, negligence or breach of trust or if there is a reduction in the extent of the Trustee’s indemnification as a result of:

^^^the Trustee’s failure to exercise any right of indemnity it has under the constitution of MDT or Macquarie Blended Property Trust, as applicable, or by law, in respect of that obligation or liability; or

^^^the Trustee’s release or waiver of any rights of indemnity it has under the constitution of MDT or Macquarie Blended Property Trust, as applicable, in respect of that obligation or liability.

^^A Trustee is not obliged to enter into any commitment or obligation under this agreement unless its liability is limited in the same manner as in this clause 9.
