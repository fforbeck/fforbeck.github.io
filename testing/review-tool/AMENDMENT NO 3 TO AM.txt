Where:

COF      =      AD x 360
^DSO      =      Days Sales Outstanding on such date

UFR      =      the “Utilization Fee Rate” (as defined in the Fee Letter on such date)

^Representations and Warranties. On the date hereof, each of the Seller and Manitowoc hereby represents and warrants (as to itself) to the Purchaser and the Agent as follows:
