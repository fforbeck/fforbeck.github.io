Section 2.7. **Amended Returns**. VPG shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, with respect to any VPG Entity, file an amended Tax Return, or file a Tax Return in a jurisdiction in which the VPG Entity has not previously filed a Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period without the prior written consent of VSH, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except as required by law. 

Section 2.8. **U.K. Group Relief Procedures** 

^^With respect to the Income Tax period ending [[Date 3: Date]], VPG shall cause the VPG Group Relief Loss for the period to be surrendered to VSH, or its appropriate affiliate to permit the full use of the loss for such period. 

^^With respect to the Income Tax period beginning on [[Date 4: Date]], to the extent permitted by law, the parties shall allocate a VPG Group Relief Loss for the year 2010 on a closing of the books of the books basis (as opposed to an allocation based on numbers of days) for the period [[Date 4]] through the date of the Distribution (the “Pre-Closing Period”). A VPG Group Relief Loss that is allocated to the Pre-Closing Period shall be first surrendered to any other VPG Entity, up to the taxable income of such entity for the Pre-Closing Period, determined on a closing of the books basis. VPG will cause the remainder of a VPG Group Relief Loss that is allocated to the Pre-Closing Period to be surrendered to VSH or its appropriate affiliate (the “VSH Loss Amount”). If based on advice of its tax advisors, VSH reasonably determines that the VPG Group Relief Loss for 2010 cannot be allocated on a closing of the books basis, and must be allocated based on the number of days in the Pre-Closing Period as compared to the number of days in 2010, VPG will nonetheless first cause an amount of the VPG Group Relief Loss equal to the VSH Loss Amount to be surrendered to VSH or its appropriate affiliate for 2010, to the extent permitted by law, and the remainder of the VPG Group Relief Loss for the year may be surrendered to a VPG Entity. 

^^With respect to other Pre-Closing Tax Periods not addressed in 2.8(a) or 2.8(b), (i) if with respect to U.K. Income Taxes a member of the VSH Group is audited in the U.K. or files an amended U.K. Income Tax return and as a result has an Income Tax liability, which could have been offset by a VPG Group Relief Loss in those years, VPG shall cause the VPG Group Relief Loss for such period to be surrendered to VSH or it appropriate affiliate, but only to the extent a VPG Entity has not used the loss, and only to the extent permitted by Law and (ii).if with respect to U.K. Income Taxes a VPG Entity is assessed a U.K. Income Tax for which VSH would be responsible under this Agreement and the amount could have been offset by a VPG Group Relief Loss in the respective year, VPG shall cause a VPG Group Relief Loss for such period to be surrendered to such VPG Entity to the extent the VPG Group Relief Loss has not been utilized. 

**LIABILITY FOR TAXES**  

Section 3.1. **Responsibility for Income Taxes**. Subject to the indemnification provided for in Section 6.1 of this Agreement, VSH shall be liable for and shall timely pay, or cause to be paid, to VPG, or at VPG’s request, the applicable Taxing Authority all VSH Income Taxes, whether payable at the time of the filing of the Tax Return, pursuant to an audit, or otherwise. The tax liability for a period that begins before and ends after the Distribution Date, shall be apportioned between VPG and VSH in a manner that reasonably reflects the portion of such tax liability attributable to VPG for the Post-Closing Tax Period, and the VPG Entities for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, respectively, as if there had been a closing of the books on the date of the Distribution. With respect to the apportionment of Income Taxes, any amounts that are determined on an annual basis, such as depreciation, Section 951(a)(1)(A) inclusions, etc., shall be apportioned between VSH and VPG based on the number of days in each of the Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the Post Closing Tax Periods, respectively. Within 15 days prior to the filing of a VPG Straddle Period Tax Return, VPG shall provide to VSH for its review and approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) written notice of the Taxes allocable to VSH pursuant to this Section 3.1 and VSH shall promptly reimburse VPG for such amounts to the extent the Income Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Periods constitute VSH Income Taxes.

Section 3.2. **Responsibility for Non-Income Taxes**. VPG and VSH will each be responsible for one half of any Pre-Closing Non-Income Taxes that are required to be paid after the Effective Time, other than Transaction Taxes. 

Section 3.3. **Responsibility for the Taxes that are Accrued**. VPG shall be liable for all Taxes that are accrued as a current liability (net of any prepaid taxes) on the balance sheet of the VPG Entity at the Effective Time, other than Transaction Taxes. 

**REFUNDS AND OTHER MATTERS**  

Section 4.1. **Refunds and Tax Benefits for VSH**. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.2, VSH shall be entitled to all refunds and credits of any VSH Income Taxes, and one half of any refund or credit for any Pre-Closing Non-Income Taxes, including any interest thereon, received by a VPG Entity. VPG shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to VSH all such refunds received by a VPG Entity. If in lieu of receiving any such refund a VPG Entity reduces a Tax liability with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period VPG shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to VSH the amount of such reduction in Tax liability when such reduction occurs. It is agreed that any amounts included as prepaid taxes on the balance sheet of a VPG Entity on the Distribution Date, whether separately stated or included in the accrual for current income taxes, shall not constitute a tax refund or credit or benefit for purposes of this Agreement. 

Section 4.2. **Carryforwards and Carrybacks**. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, VPG shall (or shall cause or permit the members of the VPG Group to) elect to relinquish any carryback of a Tax Asset to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. No Party shall be obligated to compensate any other Party for the carryforward of Tax Assets from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to a Post-Closing Tax Period or for the carryback of Tax Assets from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Tax Asset arises in a Post-Closing Tax Period on a non-U.S separate company Tax Return, and it is required by law that it be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, such carryback will be permitted, and any resulting refund, credit or other benefit shall inure to VPG.

**SPECIFIC COVENANT WITH RESPECT TO ASSET SALE**

Section 9.1. **Transaction**. It is expected that the sale of the VIL Assets to VATL (the “**VIL Asset Sale**”) will not create any cash tax liability for VIL in Israel in the tax year of the sale because of the ability to offset the any gain on the transaction against the existing net operating loss (“**NOL**”) in VIL.

Section 9.2. **Filing of Tax Return.** VSH will actively pursue obtaining an opinion or other acceptable form of advice from its Israeli tax advisors that confirms at a “more likely than not” or higher level of comfort that the NOL may be used by VIL to offset any gain on the sale of the VIL Assets (the “**Advice**”). Provided that VSH receives such Advice, VSHagrees that the Tax Return for VIL that includes the VIL Asset Sale shall be prepared and filed on the assumption that the NOL of VIL offsets the gain on the VIL Asset Sale and VSH shall not and shall not permit any member of the VSH Group to take a different position on any Tax Return or in any discussion, whether written or oral, with any Tax Authorities. 

Section 9.3. **Impact of Transaction.** If a Final Determination is reached that the NOL cannot be used to offset the gain, (as opposed to a determination that the NOL is not sufficiently large to offset the gain, or some other reason), then VATL shall make a payment to VSH as follows: 

^^To the extent VATL has been able to amortize or depreciate the VIL Assets and realize a reduction in its tax, the aggregate amount of such reduction actually realized by the time of the Final Determination shall be paid by VATL to VSH within 15 days of the Final Determination. 

^^To the extent the VIL Assets at the time of the Final Determination have not been fully amortized or depreciated for tax purposes by VATL, and a deferred tax asset is recorded on the books of VATL for the future tax benefit of the amortization or depreciation of the VIL Assets and there is no valuation allowance or similar impairment taken against the deferred tax asset, within 30 days after the Final Determination VATL shall pay to VSH the net present value of the deferred tax benefit. The net present value shall be determined using a discount rate equal to the rate of Interest in effect on the date of the Final Determination.

^^In no event shall the amount payable by VPG pursuant to this Section 9.3 exceed the Tax liability of VIL that arises solely by virtue of the inability to apply its NOL to offset the gain recognized on the VIL Asset Sale. 

Section 9.4. **Advice Not Received** If the Israeli tax advisors are unable to render the Advice, and because of that the VIL Tax Return does not offset the gain on the sale of the VIL Assets with the NOL, VATL shall make a payment to VSH as follows: 

^^If a deferred tax asset is recorded on the books of VATL for the future tax benefit of the amortization or depreciation of the VIL Assets and there is no valuation allowance or similar impairment taken against the deferred tax asset, within 30 days after VSH pays the Taxes due on the VIL Asset Sale VATL shall pay to VSH the net present value of the deferred tax benefit. The net present value shall be determined using a discount rate equal to the rate of Interest in effect on the date of the payment**.**

^^In no event shall the amount payable by VPG pursuant to this Section 9.4 exceed the Tax liability of VIL that arises solely by virtue of the inability to apply its NOL to offset the gain recognized on the VIL Asset Sale. 

Section 9.5. **Audit Management.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the this Agreement, if VSH or a VSH Group member receives notice, whether written or otherwise, that the Israeli tax authorities may challenge the ability to offset the gain on the VIL asset sale with the NOL, VSH shall promptly notify VPG. The control of such Proceedings and the settlement shall be handled as provided in section 8.2(a) of this Agreement.
