The grant of an Award under the Plan shall not confer any rights upon the Participant holding such Award other than such terms, and subject to such conditions, as are specified in the Plan as being applicable to such type of Award, or to all Awards, or as are expressly set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the existence of the Plan nor anything contained in the Plan or in any Award Agreement shall be deemed to:

^^Give any Employee the right to be retained in the service of the Company or any Subsidiary, whether in any particular position, at any particular rate of compensation, for any particular period of time or otherwise;

^^Restrict in any way the right of Company or any Subsidiary to terminate, change or modify any Employee’s service at any time with or without cause;

^^Constitute a contract of employment or service between the Company or any Subsidiary and any Employee, nor shall it constitute a right to remain in the employ or service of the Company or any Subsidiary;

^^Give any Employee the right to receive any bonus, whether payable in cash or in Shares, or in any combination thereof, from the Company or any Subsidiary, nor be construed as limiting in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to determine, in its sole discretion, whether or not it shall pay any Employee bonuses, and, if so paid, the amount thereof and the manner of such payment; or

^^Give any Participant any rights whatsoever with respect to an Award except as specifically provided in the Plan and the Award Agreement.

^^**Adoption of the Plan**.The adoption of the Plan shall not be deemed to give any Employee or any other individual any right to be selected as a Participant or to be granted an Award, or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future Award.

^^**Vesting**. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, a Participant’s right or entitlement to exercise or otherwise vest in any Award shall only result from continued services or employment with the Company Group and satisfaction of performance goals and other conditions or restrictions applicable, by its terms, to such Award.

^^**No Effects on Benefits**. Payments and other compensation received by a Participant under an Award are not part of such Participant’s normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose, including calculating termination, indemnity, severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments under any laws, plans, contracts, policies, programs, arrangements or otherwise. A Participant shall, by participating in the Plan, waive any and all rights to compensation or damages in consequence of Termination of such Participant for any reason whatsoever, whether lawfully or otherwise, insofar as those rights arise or may arise from such Participant ceasing to have rights under the Plan as a result of such Termination, or from the loss or diminution in value of such rights or entitlements, including by reason of the operation of the terms of the Plan or the provisions of any statute or law relating to taxation. No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages arises from the termination of the Plan or diminution in value of any Award or Shares purchased or otherwise received under the Plan.

^^**One or More Types of Awards**. A particular type of Award may be granted to a Participant either alone or in addition to other Awards under the Plan.

^\centered **CHANGE OF CONTROL**

^^**Alternative Awards**. The occurrence of a Change of Control will not itself result in the cancellation, acceleration of vesting, lapse of any Performance Period or settlement or other payment with respect to any outstanding Award to the extent that the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion, prior to such Change of Control, that such outstanding Award shall be honored or assumed, or that new rights shall be substituted therefor (such honored, assumed or substituted Award being hereinafter referred to as an “**Alternative Award**”) by the New Employer , **provided** that any Alternative Award must:

^^be based on securities that are traded on an established securities market, or which will be so traded within sixty (60) days following the Change of Control;

^^provide the Participant (or each Participant in a class of Participants) with rights and entitlements substantially equivalent to or better than the rights, terms and conditions applicable under such Award, including an identical or better exercise or vesting schedule and identical or better timing and methods of payment;

^^have substantially equivalent economic value to such Award immediately prior to the Change of Control (as determined by the Board or the Committee (as constituted prior to the Change of Control), in its discretion);

^^have terms and conditions which provide that if the Participant incurs a Termination by the New Employer under any circumstances other than involuntary Termination for Cause or resignation without Good Reason within two (2) years following the Change of Control, then the Performance Period applicable to [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of such Alternative Award shall immediately terminate in full, any conditions on the Participant’s rights under, and, in the case of Performance Restricted Shares, any restrictions on transfer applicable to, such Alternative Award shall be waived or shall lapse in full, and such Alternative Award shall become fully vested; and

^^not subject the Participant to the assessment of additional taxes or interest under Section 409A of the Code.

^^**Accelerated Vesting and Payment**.  
^^In the event Section 9.1 does not apply to an outstanding Award, upon a Change of Control, (i) the Performance Period applicable to [[Percentage 4]]% of such Award shall immediately terminate in full, and such Award shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable; (ii) the Board or the Committee (as constituted prior the Change of Control) shall provide that in connection with the Change of Control (A) such Award shall be cancelled in exchange for an amount (payable in accordance with Section 9.2(b)) equal to the Change of Control Price multiplied by the full number of Shares covered by such Award and (B) subject to Section 11.5, any Award the payment or settlement of which was deferred under Section 14.5 or otherwise shall be cancelled in exchange for the full amount of such deferred Award (payable in accordance with Section 9.2(b)); (ii) the Company’s TSR ranking with respect to such Award shall be deemed to be at least equal to the 90th percentile, and any other target performance goals applicable to such Award shall be deemed to have been attained in full (unless actual performance exceeds the target, in which case actual performance shall be used) for the entire applicable Performance Period then outstanding; and (iii) the Board or the Committee (as constituted prior the Change of Control) may, in addition to the consequences otherwise set forth in this Section 9.2(a), make adjustments and / or settlements of such Award as it deems appropriate and consistent with the Plan’s purposes.

^^**Payments**. Payment of any amounts in accordance with this Section 9.2 shall be made in cash or, if determined by the Board or the Committee (as constituted prior to the Change of Control), in securities of the New Employer that are traded on an established securities market, or which will be so traded within sixty (60) days following the Change of Control, having an aggregate fair market value (as determined by such

Board or Committee) equal to such amount or in a combination of such securities and cash. All amounts payable hereunder shall be payable in full, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) business days, following the Change of Control.

^^**Certain Terminations Prior to Change** **of** **Control**. Any Participant who incurs a Termination under any circumstances other than involuntary Termination for Cause or resignation without Good Reason on or after the date on which the Company entered into an agreement in principle the consummation of which would constitute a Change of Control, but prior to such consummation, and such Change of Control actually occurs, shall be treated, solely for purposes of the Plan (including this Article IX), as continuing in the Company’s, or the applicable Subsidiary’s, employment or servic e until the occurrence of such Change of Control and to have been Terminated under such circumstances immediately thereafter.

^^**No Implied Rights; Other Limitations**. No Participant shall have any right to prevent the consummation of any of the acts described in Section 4.2 or this Article IX affecting the number of Shares available to, or other entitlement of, such Participant under the Plan or such Participant’s Award. Any actions or determinations of the Committee under Article IX need not be uniform as to all outstanding Awards, nor treat all Participants identically. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article IX, the Committee shall determine the adjustments provided in this Article IX subject to Section 11.5(d).

^^**Termination, Amendment, and Modifications of Change of Control Provisions**. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan (but subject to the limitations of the last sentence of Section 10.1 and Section 10.2) or any Award Agreement provision, the provisions of this Article IX may not be terminated, amended, or modified on or after the date of a Change of Control to materially impair any Participant’s Award theretofore granted and then outstanding under the Plan without the prior written consent of such Participant.

^\centered **AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION**

^^**Amendment and Termination of the Plan**. The Board may, at any time and with or without prior notice, amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, retroactively or otherwise, but no such amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall be made which would materially impair the previously accrued rights of any Participant with respect to a previously granted Award without such Participant’s consent, except any such amendment made to comply with applicable law, tax rules, stock exchange rules or accounting rules. In addition, no such amendment shall be made without the approval of the Company’s shareholders to the extent (a) such approval is required by any applicable law, tax rules, stock exchange rules or accounting rules or (b) such amendment materially increases the benefits to Participants under the Plan.

^^**Amendment of Awards**. The Committee may unilaterally amend or alter the terms of any Award theretofore granted, including any Award Agreement, retroactively or otherwise, **provided**, **however**, that no such amendment shall (a) be inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan, (b) materially increase the benefits to the Participant to whom such

Award was granted or (c) materially impair the previously accrued rights of the Participant to whom such Award was granted with respect to such Award without his or her consent, except such an amendment made to cause the Plan or such Award to comply with applicable law, tax rules, stock exchange rules or accounting rules.

^\centered **TAX WITHHOLDING AND OTHER TAX MATTERS**

^^**Tax Withholding**. The Company and/or any Subsidiary are authorized to withhold from any Award granted or payment due under the Plan the amount of all Federal, state, local and non-United States taxes due in respect of such Award or payment and take any such other action as may be necessary or appropriate, as determined by the Committee, to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income or wages of a Participant for federal, state, local, or non-U.S. tax purposes with respect to any Award, such Participant shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding the pay ment of, any federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxes or social security (or similar) contributions of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such amount. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Committee in its discretion), and the Company and the Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to such Participant, whether or not under the Plan.

^^**Withholding or Tendering Shares**. Without limiting the generality of Section 11.1, the Committee may in its discretion permit a Participant to satisfy or arrange to satisfy, in whole or in part, the tax obligations incident to an Award by: (a) electing to have the Company withhold Shares or other property otherwise deliverable to such Participant pursuant to his or her Award (**provided**, **however**, that the amount of any Shares so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy required Federal, state, local and non-United States withholdin g obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for Federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income) and/or (b) tendering to the Company Shares owned by such Participant (or by such Participant and his or her spouse jointly) and purchased or held for the requisite period of time as may be required to avoid the Company’s or the Subsidiaries’ incurring an adverse accounting charge, based, in each case, on the fair market value of the Shares on the payment date as determined by the Committee. All such elections shall be irrevocable, made in writing, signed by the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. The Committee may establish such procedures as it deems appropriate, including making irrevocable elections, for settlement of withholding obligations with Common Stock.

^^**Restrictions**. The satisfaction of tax obligations pursuant to this Article XI shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may impose, including any restrictions required by applicable law or the rules and regulations of the SEC, and shall be construed consistent with an intent to comply with any such applicable laws, rule and regulations.

^^**Section 83(b) Election**. If a Participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed with respect to an Award as of the date of transfer of Shares rather than as of the date or dates upon which the Participant would otherwise be taxable under Section 83(a) of the Code, such Participant shall deliver a copy of such election to the Company immediately at or prior to filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall have any liability or responsibility relating to or arising out of the filing or not filing of any such election or any defects in its construction.

^^**Nonqualified Deferred Compensation**.

^^It is the intention of the Company that no Award shall be deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A unless and to the extent that the Committee specifically determines otherwise as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 11.5, and the Plan and the terms and conditions of all Awards shall be interpreted and administered accordingly.

^^The terms and conditions governing any Awards that the Committee determines will be subject to Section 409A of the Code, including any rules for payment or elective or mandatory deferral of the payment or delivery of cash or Shares pursuant thereto, and any rules regarding treatment of such Awards in the event of a Change of Control, shall be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement and shall be intended to comply in all respects with Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan and the terms and conditions of such Awards shall be interpreted and administered accordingly.

^^Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.2 to the contrary, (i) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 4.2 to Awards that are considered “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; (ii) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 4.2 to Awards that are not considered “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that after such adjustment, the Awards either (A) continue not to be subject to Section 409A of the Code or (B) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; and (iii) in any event, neit her the Committee nor the Board shall have any authority to make any adjustments, substitutions or changes pursuant to Section 4.2 to the extent the existence of such authority would cause an Award that is not intended to be subject to Section 409A of the Code at the Grant Date thereof to be subject to Section 409A of the Code.

^^If any Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the provisions of Article IX shall be applicable to such Award only to the extent permitted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 11.5.

^^**Transfer, Leave of Absence**.For purposes of the Plan, a transfer of an Employee from the Company to a Subsidiary, or vice versa, or from one Subsidiary to another, and a leave of absence, duly authorized in writing by the Company or a Subsidiary, shall not be deemed a Termination of the Employee for purposes of the Plan or with respect to any Award.

^^If at any time the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration and/or qualification of Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state, Federal or non-United States law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the sale or purchase of Shares hereunder, the Company shall have no obligation to allow the grant, exercise or payment of any Award, or to issue or deliver evidence of title for Shares issued under the Plan, in whole or in part, unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent and/or approval shall have been effected or obtained , or otherwise provided for, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.

^^Upon termination of any period of suspension under this Section 14.7, any Award affected by such suspension which shall not then have expired or terminated shall be reinstated as to all Shares available before such suspension and as to the Shares which would otherwise have become available during the period of such suspension, but no suspension shall extend the term of any Award.

^^The Committee may require each person receiving Shares in connection with any Award under the Plan to represent and agree with the Company in writing that such person is acquiring such Shares for investment without a view to the distribution thereof, and/or provide such other representations and agreements as the Committee may prescribe.

**Annex A**  

\centered **Certain Terms of Awards**

**Performance period**  
The Performance Period shall be a period of three years beginning on the date set forth in the Award Agreement. Subject to the achievement of the performance and continued employment or termination of employment conditions, the Award will vest only at the end of the Performance Period (i.e., no intermediate vesting dates).

**Performance Conditions**  
Vesting of the Award shall be based on the Company’s TSR ranking compared to the TSRs of a global group of Company comparators selected by the Committee (the “**Peer Group**”). Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Peer Group shall consist of the following companies:

Aker Solutions 
Amec Plc. 
Fugro Nv 
Global Industries Limited 
Helix Energy Solutions Group Inc. 
McDermott Intl. Inco. 
Oceaneering Intl. Inco. 
Petrofac Ltd. 
Saipem 
Sbm Offshore Nv 
Subsea 7 Inco. 
Technip SA 
Wellstream Holdings Plc. 
Wood Group (John) Plc.  
Any changes to the Peer Group shall be determined by the Committee on a consistent basis, i.e., the Company anticipates that any company included within the Peer Group that significantly changes during the Performance Period (for example, due to merger or de-listing), as determined by the Committee, will be excluded from the Peer Group for the purposes of the entire TSR comparison calculation.

TSR shall be adjusted by the Committee in its discretion to take into account relevant matters such as share splits and averaging periods and shall also be converted to United States Dollars based on a policy established by the Committee (the Company anticipates that such policy will follow the practices and exchange rates used by the data source referred to below). For purposes of calculating the Company’s relative TSR, a consistent data source will be used (such as Datastream), and the composition of the Peer Group will be monitored on an annual basis.

TSR of each relevant company will be computed based on the excess of the weighted average closing common share price of such company over the last 90 trading days of the Performance

Period over the weighted average closing common share price of such company over the first 90 trading days of the Performance Period, plus any dividends paid by such company reinvested in its common shares during the Performance Period. Vesting of an Award at the end of the Performance Period shall be based on the ranking of the Company’s TSR performance against that of the Peer Group for the Performance Period, in accordance with the following schedule:

\centered \centered **Actual ranked TSR position**   \centered **achieved by the Company during**   \centered **the Performance Period**   \centered **Percentage of Shares**   \centered **subject to Award** 
\centered Below 50th percentile   \centered [[Percentage 5: Number]]% 
\centered Equal to or greater than 50th   \centered percentile but less than 90th   \centered percentile   \centered [[Percentage 6: Number]]% 
\centered 90th percentile or above   

\centered [[Percentage 4]]%  

If the actual ranked TSR position achieved by the Company during the Performance Period is equal to or greater than the 50th percentile, but less than the 90th percentile, vesting between [[Percentage 6]]% and [[Percentage 4]]% shall be determined by linear interpolation. To the extent the Award does not vest as set forth above at the end of the Performance Period, the Award shall be forfeited.

For these purposes, the Committee shall determine the Company’s actual ranked TSR position during the Performance Period.

**Maximum Award limits**  
The maximum aggregate number of Shares that may be subject to all Awards granted in any calendar year to any one Senior Executive shall be that number of Shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to [[Percentage 7: Number]]% of his or her annual base salary as of the first day of such year.

The maximum aggregate number of Shares that may be subject to all Awards granted in any calendar year to any one Employee who is not a Senior Executive shall be that number of Shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to [[Percentage 4]]% of his or her annual base salary as of the first day of such year.

**Minimum Share ownership requirements for Senior Executives**

In line with the Company Group’s compensation strategy, each Senior Executive will be required to build up and retain ownership of Shares such that he or she holds Shares that have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to at least [[Percentage 7]]% of his or her annual base salary as determined as of the first day of any calendar year. Senior Executives may satisfy this Share ownership requirement with: vested Shares (however acquired) owned directly by the Senior

Executive, the Senior Executive’s spouse or a trust of which the Senior Executive or his or her spouse is a beneficiary; Shares held indirectly by the Senior Executive through a tax-qualified savings or retirement plan of the Company or a Subsidiary or Shares subject to an outstanding unvested Performance Restricted Share Award or Performance Share Unit Award. Senior Executives are prohibited from engaging in any hedging strategy using puts, calls or other types of derivative securities based on the value of Shares.

Until a Senior Executive achieves this minimum Shareholding requirement, such Senior Executive will be required to continue to hold at least [[Percentage 1]]% of the Shares subject to Performance Restricted Shares Awards that vest or are issued to the Senior Executive pursuant to Performance Share Unit Awards, during such calendar year, after payment of taxes due in respect of such Shares.

The Committee will determine, from time to time, the Employees covered by the Senior Executive category. Unless otherwise so determined by the Committee, this category shall include the Chief Executive Officer and the Core Team Management / Key Officers of the Company.
