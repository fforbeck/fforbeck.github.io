*Administration Agreement*  *(BAAT 20[ ]-[ ])*

grossly negligent actions, its own grossly negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct in the performance of any of the Administrator’s duties under this Agreement. 

^Independence of the Administrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, the Administrator shall be an independent contractor and shall not be subject to the supervision of the Issuer with respect to the manner in which it accomplishes the performance of its obligations hereunder. Unless expressly authorized by the Issuer, the Administrator shall have no authority to act for or to represent the Issuer in any way (other than as permitted hereunder) and shall not otherwise be deemed an agent of the Issuer.

Nothing contained in this Agreement (i) shall constitute the Administrator and the Issuer as members of any partnership, joint venture, association, syndicate, unincorporated business or other separate entity, (ii) shall be construed to impose any liability as such on any of them or (iii) shall be deemed to confer on any of them any express, implied or apparent authority to incur any obligation or liability on behalf of the other. 

^Other Activities of the Administrator. Nothing herein shall prevent the Administrator or its Affiliates from engaging in other businesses or, in its sole discretion, from acting in a similar capacity as an Administrator for any other Person even though such Person may engage in business activities similar to those of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee. 

^Representations and Warranties of the Administrator. The Administrator represents and warrants to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee as follows: 

^^Existence and Power. The Administrator is a national banking association validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States and has, in all material respects, all power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted. The Administrator has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction where the failure to do so would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Administrator to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents or affect the enforceability or collectibility of the Receivables or any other part of the Collateral. 

^^Authorization and No Contravention.The execution, delivery and performance by the Administrator of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party (i) have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Administrator and (ii) do not contravene or constitute a default under (A) any applicable law, rule or regulation, (B) its organizational documents or (C) any material agreement, contract, order or other instrument to which it is a party or its property is subject (other than violations which do not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of such agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by, or the Administrator’s ability to perform its obligations under, the Transaction Documents). 

^^No Consent Required. No approval or authorization by, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Administrator of any Transaction Document other than (i) UCC 

*Administration Agreement*  *(BAAT 20[ ]-[ ])*

filings, (ii) approvals and authorizations that have previously been obtained and filings that have previously been made and (iii) approvals, authorizations or filings which, if not obtained or made, would not have a material adverse effect on the enforceability or collectibility of the Receivables or any other part of the Collateral or would not materially and adversely affect the ability of the Administrator to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents. 

^^Binding Effect. Each Transaction Document to which the Administrator is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Administrator enforceable against the Administrator in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership, conservatorship or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and, if applicable, the rights of creditors of national banking associations from time to time in effect or by general principles of equity. 

^Administrator Replacement Events; Termination of the Administrator. 

^^Subject to clauses (d) and (e) below, the Administrator may resign its duties hereunder by providing the Issuer with at least sixty (60) days’ prior written notice. 

^^Subject to clauses (d) and (e) below, the Issuer may remove the Administrator without cause by providing the Administrator with at least sixty (60) days’ prior written notice; *provided*, that, for so long as any Notes are Outstanding, the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied in connection therewith. 

^^The occurrence of any one of the following events (each, an “Administrator Replacement Event”) shall also entitle the Issuer, subject to Section 20 hereof, to terminate and replace the Administrator: 

^^^any failure by the Administrator to deliver or cause to be delivered any required payment to the Securities Administrator for distribution to the Noteholders, which failure continues unremedied for a period of ten (10) Business Days after discovery thereof by a Responsible Officer of the Administrator or receipt by the Administrator of written notice thereof from the Securities Administrator or Noteholders evidencing at least a majority of the Outstanding Note Balance; 

^^^any failure by the Administrator to duly observe or perform in any material respect any other of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement, which failure materially and adversely affects the rights of the Issuer or the Noteholders, and which continues unremedied for ninety (90) days after discovery thereof by a Responsible Officer of the Administrator or receipt by the Administrator of written notice thereof from the Indenture Trustee or Noteholders evidencing at least a majority of the Outstanding Note Balance; 

^^^any representation or warranty of the Administrator made in any Transaction Document to which the Administrator is a party or by which it is bound or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement proves to have been 

*Administration Agreement*  *(BAAT 20[ ]-[ ])*

incorrect in any material respect when made, which failure materially and adversely affects the rights of the Issuer or the Noteholders, and which failure continues unremedied for ninety (90) days after discovery thereof by a Responsible Officer of the Administrator or receipt by the Administrator of written notice thereof from the Indenture Trustee or Noteholders evidencing at least a majority of the Outstanding Note Balance; or 

^^^the Administrator suffers a Bankruptcy Event; 

*provided, however*, that if a delay in or failure of performance referred to under clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above was caused by *force majeure* or other similar occurrence the grace period in the applicable clause will be extended for an additional thirty (30) days. The existence or occurrence of any “material instance of noncompliance” (within the meaning of Item 1122 of Regulation AB) shall not create any presumption that any event in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above has occurred. 

^^If an Administrator Replacement Event shall have occurred, the Issuer may, subject to Section 20 hereof, by notice given to the Administrator and the Owner Trustee, terminate all or a portion of the rights and powers of the Administrator under this Agreement, including the rights of the Administrator to receive the annual fee for services hereunder for all periods following such termination; *provided*, *however*, that such termination shall not become effective until such time as the Issuer, subject to Section 20 hereof, shall have appointed a successor Administrator with the consent of the Indenture Trustee in the manner set forth below. Upon any such termination, all rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of the Administrator under this Agreement shall vest in and be assumed by any successor Administrator appointed by the Issuer, subject to Section 20 hereof, pursuant to a management agreement between the Issuer and such successor Administrator, containing substantially the same provisions as this Agreement (including with respect to the compensation of such successor Administrator), and the successor Administrator is hereby irrevocably authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Administrator, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect such vesting and assumption. Further, in such event, the Administrator shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the orderly and efficient transfer of the administration of the Issuer to the new Administrator. 

^^The Issuer, subject to Section 20 hereof, may waive in writing any Administrator Replacement Event by the Administrator in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences. Upon any such waiver of a past Administrator Replacement Event, such Administrator Replacement Event shall cease to exist, and any Administrator Replacement Event arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Administrator Replacement Event or impair any right consequent thereon. 

^Action upon Termination or Removal. Promptly upon the effective date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8, or the removal of the Administrator 

*Administration Agreement*  *(BAAT 20[ ]-[ ])*

pursuant to Section 8, the Administrator shall be entitled to be paid by the Servicer all fees and reimbursable expenses accruing to it to the date of such termination or removal. If the Administrator is removed without cause, the Servicer will be responsible for any costs, expenses or indemnities incurred by the Administrator in connection with its removal. 

^Liens. The Administrator will not directly or indirectly create, allow or suffer to exist any Lien on the Collateral other than Permitted Liens. 

^Notices. All demands, notices and communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered or mailed by registered or certified first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, hand delivery, prepaid courier service, or by facsimile, and addressed in each case as specified on Schedule I to the Sale Agreement or at such other address as shall be designated by any of the specified addressees in a written notice to the other parties hereto. Delivery shall occur only upon receipt or reported tender of such communication by an officer of the recipient entitled to receive such notices located at the address of such recipient for notices hereunder. 

^[RESERVED.] 

^Amendments. 

^^Any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended by the Administrator with prior written notice to each Rating Agency but without the consent of the Indenture Trustee, the Securities Administrator, any Noteholder, the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Depositor, the First Tier Purchaser, the Second Tier Purchaser or any other Person subject to subsection (d) of this Section 13; *provided* that (i) such amendment shall not, as evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate of the Depositor or an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Indenture Trustee, the Securities Administrator and the Owner Trustee materially and adversely affect the interests of the Noteholders or (ii) the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect to such amendment; *provided further*, that in the case of any amendment pursuant to this Section 13(a), such amendment shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel, (i) affect the treatment of the Notes as indebtedness for federal income tax purposes, (ii) be deemed to cause, for federal income tax purposes, a taxable exchange of the Notes or (iii) cause the Issuer (or any part thereof) to be treated as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. 

^^Subject to subsection (d) of this Section 13, this Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Issuer, the Administrator and the Indenture Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than a majority of the Outstanding Note Balance of the Controlling Class, voting as a single class, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders. It will not be necessary for the consent of Noteholders to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or consent, but it will be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents (and any other consents of Noteholders provided for in this Agreement) and of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by Noteholders will be subject to such reasonable 

*Administration Agreement*  *(BAAT 20[ ]-[ ])*

requirements as the Indenture Trustee may prescribe, including the establishment of record dates pursuant to the Note Depository Agreement.

The Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such amendment which adversely affects the Owner Trustee’s or the Indenture Trustee’s, as applicable, own rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement may not be amended in any way that would materially and adversely affect the Owner Trustee’s, [the Swap Counterparty’s] or the Indenture Trustee’s rights, privileges, indemnities, duties or obligations under this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or otherwise without the prior written consent of such party. 

^Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

^^^consents that any such action or Proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of such action or Proceeding in any such court or that such action or Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; 

*Administration Agreement*  *(BAAT 20[ ]-[ ])*

^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
