^Limitation on Liability of Administrator. Neither the Administrator nor any of the directors, officers, employees or agents of the Administrator shall be under any liability to the Seller, the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders or the Certificateholder, except as provided under this Agreement, for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action pursuant to this Agreement or for errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Administrator or any such person against any liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this Agreement. The Administrator and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Administrator may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any person respecting any matters arising under this Agreement.

^Additional Requirements of the Administrator.

^^Reporting Requirements.

^^^If so requested by the Issuer for the purpose of satisfying its reporting obligation under the Exchange Act with respect to any class of asset-backed securities, the Administrator shall (i) notify the Issuer in writing of any material litigation or governmental proceedings pending against the Administrator and (ii) provide to the Issuer a description of such proceedings.

^^^As a condition to the succession to the Administrator by any Person as permitted by Section 8 hereof, the Administrator shall provide to the Issuer, at least 10 Business Days prior to the effective date of such succession or appointment, (x) written notice to the Issuer, of such succession or appointment and (y) in writing all information in order to comply with its reporting obligation under Item 6.02 of Form 8-K with respect to any class of asset-backed securities.

^^^In addition to such information as the Administrator, as administrator, is obligated to provide pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement, if so requested by the Issuer, the Administrator shall provide such information regarding the performance or servicing of the Receivables as is reasonably required to facilitate preparation of distribution reports in accordance with Item 1121 of Regulation AB.

^^Report on Assessment of Compliance and Attestation. On or before 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year ended [[Date 2: Date]], the Administrator shall, if requested by the Issuer, not later than [[Date 3: Date]] of the calendar year in which such certification is to be delivered, deliver to the Issuer and any other Person that will be responsible for signing a Sarbanes Certification on behalf of an asset-backed issuer with respect to a securitization transaction, a certification in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Administrator acknowledges that the Issuer may rely on the certification provided by the Administrator pursuant to such clause in signing a Sarbanes C ertification and filing such with the Commission. The Issuer shall not request delivery of such certification unless the Depositor is required under the Exchange Act to file an annual report on Form 10-K with respect to an issuing entity whose asset pool includes the Receivables.

^^Intent of the Parties; Reasonableness. The Issuer and the Administrator acknowledge and agree that the purpose of Section 20 of this Agreement is to facilitate compliance by the Issuer with the provisions of Regulation AB and related rules and regulations of the Commission.

Neither the Issuer nor the Administrator shall exercise its right to request delivery of information or other performance under these provisions other than in good faith, or for purposes other than compliance with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (or the provision in a private offering of disclosure comparable to that required under the Securities Act). The Administrator acknowledges that interpretations of the requirements of Regulation AB may change over time, whether due to interpretive guidance provided by the Commission or its staff, consensus among participants in the asset-backed securities markets, advice of counsel, or otherwise, and agrees to comply with requests made by the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer or any other party to the Transaction Documents in good faith for delivery of information under these provisions on the basis of evolving interpretations of Regulation AB. In connection therewith, the Administrator shall cooperate fully with the Issuer to deliver to the Issuer (including any of its assignees or designees), any and all statements, reports, certifications, records and any other information necessary in the good faith determination of the Issuer, to permit the Issuer to comply with the provisions of Regulation AB.

The Issuer (including any of its assignees or designees) shall cooperate with the Administrator by providing timely notice of requests for information under these provisions and by reasonably limiting such requests to information required, in the Issuer’s reasonable judgment, to comply with Regulation AB.

^NO PETITION. 

Each of the parties hereto, by entering into this Agreement, hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not at any time acquiesce, petition or otherwise invoke or cause the Issuer or the Depositor to invoke the process of any court or government authority for the purpose of commencing or sustaining a case against the Issuer or the Depositor under any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official of the Issuer or the Depositor, as the case may be, or any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Issuer or the Depositor, in connection with any obligations relating to the Notes, the Certificates, this Agreement or any of the Basic Documents prior to the date that is one year and one day after the date on which the Indenture is terminated. This Section 21 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the termination of the Administrator under this Agreement.

^Third-Party Beneficiary. 

The Owner Trustee is a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and is entitled to the rights and benefits given to the Owner Trustee hereunder and may enforce the provisions applicable to the Owner Trustee as if the Owner Trustee were a party hereto. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the day and year first above written.
