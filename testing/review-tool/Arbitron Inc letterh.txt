Dear [Name]:  

We are pleased to inform you that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Arbitron Inc. (the “***Company***”) has selected you as someone eligible for a potential, performance-based bonus (the “***Award***”) under the Arbitron Inc. Performance Cash Award Program (the “***Program***”), which operates under the Arbitron Inc. 2008 Equity Compensation Plan (the “***Equity Plan***”). In addition to your regular compensation and the possibility of annual bonuses, the Program will provide longer term incentive compensation, generally based on three-year cycles. 

Assuming you remain employed by the Company or one of its affiliates until the payment date for the first three-year cycle ([[Date 1: Date]]  [[Date 2: Date]]), which we expect to be some time before [[Date 3: Date]], you will be potentially eligible to receive an Award payment based on the results of the Company’s cumulative diluted earnings per share over the three year period and on a series of additional performance factors about which you may receive information from time to time. The Target Amount is not influenced by the price of Arbitron common stock after the grant date. The Program also includes special rules if a participant dies, becomes disabled, or retires (after reaching age 55 and 10 years of continuous service). 

Assuming the Company meets all goals at [[Percentage 1: Number]]% and you remain employed, your Award payment is targeted to be equal to $, which is the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Equity Plan) of  shares of the Company’s common stock determined as of , the date you are granted the Award (the “***Target Amount***” for purposes of the Program). Your actual Award payment will go up or down depending upon the actual results under the performance factors (and the Committee’s discretion), with no award payment due in some circumstances and a potential payment in excess of the Target Amount if the Company’s performance reaches or exceed [[Percentage 1]]% of the Performance Goal(s), to a maximum of [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the Target Amount. 

In addition, the Company currently expects to start a new three-year cycle in 2011, so the Program could potentially provide even more incentives.
