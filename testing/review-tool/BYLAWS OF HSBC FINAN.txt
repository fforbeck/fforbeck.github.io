In case any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the Corporation, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have been delivered by the Corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be adopted by the Corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signatures shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the Corporation.

^Fixing Record Date.

^In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action.

^If no record date is fixed:

^The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

^The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

^Registered Shareholders. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the law.

^Lost Certificates. Any person claiming a certificate of stock to be lost or destroyed shall make an affidavit or affirmation of that fact and advertise the same in such manner as the Board may require, and the Board may, in its discretion, require the owner of the lost or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond, sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss of any such certificate. A new certificate of the same tenor and for the same number of shares as the one alleged to be lost or destroyed may be issued without requiring any bond when, in the judgment of the Board, it is proper so to do.

^EMERGENCY BYLAWS.

^^When Operative. Notwithstanding any different provision in the preceding Articles of the bylaws or in the Certificate of Incorporation, the emergency bylaws provided in this Article VI shall be operative during any emergency resulting from an attack on the United States or on a locality in which the Corporation conducts its business or customarily holds meetings of its Board or its stockholders, or during any nuclear or atomic disaster, or during the existence of any catastrophe, or other similar emergency condition, as a result of which a quorum of the Board or a standing committee thereof cannot readily be convened for action.

^Board Meetings. During any such emergency, a meeting of the Board may be called by any director or, if necessary, by any officer who is not a director. The meeting shall be held at such time and place, within or without Lake County, Illinois, specified by the person calling the meeting and in the notice of the meeting which shall be given to such of the directors as it may be feasible to reach at the time and by such means as may be feasible at the time, including publication or radio. Such advance notice shall be given as, in the judgment of the person calling the meeting, circumstances permit. Two directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. To the extent required to constitute a quorum at the meeting, the officers present shall be deemed, in order of rank and within the same rank in order of seniority, directors for the meeting.

^Amendments to Emergency Bylaws. These emergency bylaws may be amended, either before or during any emergency, to make any further or different provision that may be practical and necessary for the circumstances of the emergency.

^CONSENTS TO CORPORATE ACTION.

^Action by Written Consent. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action which is required to be or may be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of Sections (2) and (3) of this Article VII, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall have been signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or to take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted; provided, however, that prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting and by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

^Determination of Record Date for Action by Written Consent. The record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be fixed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Any stockholder seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall, by written notice to the Corporate Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. Upon receipt of such a request, the Corporate Secretary shall, as promptly as practicable, call a special meeting of the Board of Directors to be held as promptly as practicable. At such meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix a record date as provided in Section 213(b) (or its successor provision) of the Delaware General Corporation Law; that record date, however, shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board nor more than 15 days from the date of the receipt of the stockholder's request. Should the Board fail to fix a record date as provided for in this Section 2, then the record date shall be the day on which the first written consent is duly delivered pursuant to Section 213(b) (or its successor provision) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or, if prior action is required by the Board with respect to such matter, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such action.

^Procedures for Written Consent. In the event of the delivery to the Corporation of a written consent or consents purporting to represent the requisite voting power to authorize or take corporate action and/or related revocations, the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation shall provide for the safekeeping of such consents and revocations.

^MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

^^Waiver of Notice. Whenever notice is required to be given, a written waiver thereof signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

^Corporate Seal. The corporate seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of the Corporation, the year of its organization and the words “Corporate Seal, Delaware”. The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any manner reproduced.

^Fiscal Year. The Fiscal Year of the Corporation shall be the calendar year.

^Records. The Bylaws and the proceedings of all meetings of the stockholders and the Board shall be recorded in appropriate minute books provided for the purpose. The minutes of each meeting of the stockholders and the Board shall be signed by the Corporate Secretary or other officer appointed to act as secretary of the meeting. The minutes of each meeting of a committee of the Board shall be signed by the chairperson of such committee or other director or officer appointed to act as secretary of the meeting.

^Amendments. The Bylaws may be added to, amended, altered or repealed at any regular meeting of the Board, by a vote of a majority of the total number of the directors, or at any meeting of stockholders, duly called and held, by a majority of the stock represented at such meeting.
