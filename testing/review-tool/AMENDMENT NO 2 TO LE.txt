^Section 1.(p) is revised such that the Rent shall be payable to the order of WE George Street, L.L.C. at c/o Winstanley Enterprises LLC, [[Address 3: Address]]. 

^Tenant acknowledges and agrees that the Grandfathered cfm Level and the Grandfathered wsf Level shall only apply to Initial Suite 202. 

^Landlord, at its expense, at any time during the Term, may relocate Tenant from Suite NMR1 and/or Suite CS02 to reasonably comparable space (“Relocation Space”) within the Building without Tenant’s consent but with not less than 60 days’ prior written notice to Tenant. In order for any Relocation Space to be deemed “reasonably comparable space” it must have a reasonably comparable layout, have substantially the same utility to Tenant (given Tenant’s particular use of the particular suite) and have no material effect on Tenant’s ability to conduct its activities in that suite. Landlord shall, at its cost, build out the Relocation Space so that its build out is substantially the same as the original suite. Such build out shall be completed prior to Tenant having to move to the Relocation Space. From and after the date of the relocation, the “Premises” shall include the Relocation Space into which Tenant has been moved and shall not include the space from which Tenant has been moved, and the Base Rent and Tenant’s Pro Rata Share shall be adjusted based on the rentable square footage of the Relocation Space. Landlord shall pay Tenant’s reasonable costs for moving to the Relocation Space, including without limitation the cost of moving Tenant’s furniture and equipment. 

^Landlord hereby grants Tenant an allowance of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] (the “Allowance”) for Alterations to the Premises to be performed by Tenant pursuant to the provisions of Section 9(c) and other applicable provisions of the Lease. Payment of the Allowance for the Alterations shall be made in accordance with the provisions set forth in **Exhibit B** attached hereto and made a part hereof. 

^Landlord may in the future enter into one or more environmental use restrictions (the “ELUR”) as defined and described in Section 22a-133k and Sections 22a-133n through 22a-133s inclusive of the Connecticut General Statutes and their associated regulations (as such statutes and/or regulations may be amended or replaced from time to time) in connection with the investigation and/or remediation of the environmental condition of the Property which ELUR shall restrict the use of the Property to commercial/industrial use and which shall prohibit demolition of the Building. Tenant agrees that the Lease and Tenant’s leasehold estate therein shall be automatically and irrevocably subject to and subordinate to the ELUR at such time as the ELUR (or any modification) is recorded on the New Haven Land Records. Landlord shall, on request of Tenant, make a copy of the ELUR available to Tenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant agrees at the request of Landlord to execute and deliver, at no cost to Landlord, an instrument in recordable form confirming the foregoing subordination. Failure of Tenant to execute and deliver such subordination within 10 days after Landlord’s request shall constitute a default under the Lease. 

^Landlord and Tenant represent and warrant to the other that each has full authority to enter into this Amendment and further agree to hold harmless, defend, and indemnify the other from any loss, costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), damages, or claim arising from any lack of such authority. 

^As modified herein, the Lease is hereby ratified and confirmed and shall remain in full force and effect. 

^Landlord and Tenant hereby represent and warrant to the other that each has not dealt with any broker, finder or like agent in connection with this Amendment and each does hereby agree to indemnify and hold the other, its agents and their officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners and employees, harmless of and from any claim of, or liability to, any broker, finder or like agent claiming a commission or fee by reason of having dealt with either party in connection with the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Amendment, and all expenses related thereto, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements. 

^This Amendment constitutes the entire agreement by and between the parties hereto and supersedes any and all previous agreements, written or oral, between the parties. No modification or amendment of this Amendment shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto. The provisions of this Amendment shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors and assigns. 

^This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of such counterparts shall constitute one agreement. This Amendment shall become effective when duly executed and delivered by all parties hereto.

^A copy of a receipted invoice or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord of the payment by Tenant to Tenant’s contractor(s) for the work performed in connection with the prior application for payment (not applicable to the first application for payment). 

^Lien waivers from all parties supplying labor or material in connection with the Alterations, in form reasonably acceptable to Landlord, which waiver may be conditioned only upon payment of work covered by the application for payment. 

^A copy of the final Certificate of Occupancy or other final communication or approval issued by the building department or other appropriate governmental authority having jurisdiction regarding the Alterations (not applicable except for the last application for payment).
