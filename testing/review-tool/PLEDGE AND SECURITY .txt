Other than the exercise of reasonable care to assure the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral and shall be relieved of all responsibility for any Collateral in its possession upon surrendering it or tendering surrender of it to any of the Grantors (or whomsoever shall be lawfully e ntitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct). The Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Agent accords its own property, it being understood that the Agent shall not have responsibility for ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relating to any Collateral, whether or not the Agent has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters. Except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency, consignee or other agent or bailee selected by the Agent in good faith.

^^Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding (i) each Grantor shall remain liable under the Licenses and otherwise in respect of the Collateral to the extent set forth therein to perform all of its obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (ii) the exercise by the Agent of any of its rights hereunder shall not release any Grantor from any of its obligations under the Licenses or otherwise in respect of the Collateral, and (iii) the Agent shall not have any obligation or liability by reason of this Agreement under the Licenses or otherwise in respect of the Collateral, nor shall the Agent be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of any Grantor thereunder or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder.

^^Upon the occurrence and the continuation of any Event of Default, the Agent may at any time in its discretion (i) without notice to any Grantor, transfer or register in the name of the Agent or any of its nominees any or all of the Pledged Interests, subject only to the revocable rights of such Grantor under Section 7(a) hereof, and (ii) exchange certificates or Instruments constituting Pledged Interests for certificates or Instruments of smaller or larger denominations.

^**Remedies Upon Default**. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:

^^The Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all of the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the Code (whether or not the Code applies to the affected Collateral), and also may (i) take absolute control of the Collateral, including, without limitation, transfer into the Agent's name or into the name of its nominee or nominees (to the extent the Agent has not theretofore done so) and thereafter receive, for the benefit of the Agent and the Holders, all payments made thereon, give all consents, waivers and ratifications in respect thereof and otherwise act with respect thereto as tho ugh it were the outright owner thereof, (ii) require each Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it will at its expense and upon request of the Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by the Agent and make it available to the Agent at a place or places to be designated by the Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties, and the Agent may enter into and occupy any premises owned or leased by any Grantor where the Collateral or any part thereof is located or assembled for a reasonable period in order to effectuate the Agent's rights and remedies hereunder or under law, without obligation to any Grantor in respect of such occupation, and (iii) without notice except as specified below and without any obligation to prepare or process the Collateral for sale, (A) sell the Collateralor any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Agent's offices, at any exchan ge or broker's board or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and at such price or prices and upon such other terms as the Agent may deem commercially reasonable and/or (B) lease, license or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof upon such terms as the Agent may deem commercially reasonable. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral shall be required by law, at least five (5) days' prior notice to the applicable Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notic e, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Each Grantor hereby waives any claims against the Agent and the Holders arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the Collateral may have been sold at a private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations, even if the Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree, and waives all rights that such Grantor may have to require that all or any part of the Collateral be marshaled upon any sale (public or private) thereof. Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that (i) any such sale of the Collateral by the Agent shall be made without warranty, (ii) the Agent may specifically disclaim any warranties of title, possession, quiet enjoyment or the like, (iii) the Agent may bid (which bid may be, in whole or in part, in the form of cancellation of indebtedness), if permitt ed by law, for the purchase, lease, license or other disposition of the Collateral or any portion thereof for the account of the Agent (on behalf of itself and the Holders) and (iv) such actions set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall not adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any such sale of the Collateral. In addition to the foregoing, (i) upon written notice to any Grantor from the Agent, each Grantor shall cease any use of the Intellectual Property or any trademark, patent or copyright similar thereto for any purpose described in such notice; (ii) the Agent may, at any time and from time to time, upon five (5) days' prior notice to any Grantor, license, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, any of the Intellectual Property, throughout the universe for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the Agent shall in its sole discretion determine; and (iii) the Agent may, at any time, pu rsuant to the authority granted in Section 8 hereof (such authority being effective upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default), execute and deliver on behalf of a Grantor, one or more instruments of assignment of the Intellectual Property (or any application or registration thereof), in form suitable for filing, recording or registration in any country.

^^In the event that the Agent determines to exercise its right to sell all or any part of the Pledged Interests pursuant to Section 9(a) hereof, each Grantor will, at such Grantor's expense and upon request by the Agent: (i) execute and deliver, and cause each issuer of such Pledged Interests and the directors and officers thereof to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts and things, as may be necessary or, in the opinion of the Agent, advisable to register such Pledged Interests under the provisions of the Securities Act, and to cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to remain effective for such peri od as prospectuses are required by law to be furnished, and to make all amendments and supplements thereto and to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of the Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto, (ii) cause each issuer of such Pledged Interests to qualify such Pledged Interests under the state securities or "Blue Sky" laws of each jurisdiction, and to obtain all necessary governmental approvals for the sale of the Pledged Interests, as requested by the Agent, (iii) cause each Pledged Issuer to make available to its securityholders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, and (iv) do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as may be necessary to make such sale of such Pledged Interests valid and binding and in compliance with applicable law. Each Grantor acknowledges the impossibilit y of ascertaining the amount of damages which would be suffered by the Agent by reason of the failure by any Grantor to perform any of the covenants contained in this Section 9(b) and, consequently, agrees that, if any Grantor fails to perform any of such covenants, it shall pay, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an amount equal to the value of the Pledged Interests on the date the Agent demands compliance with this Section 9(b); **provided**, **however**, that the payment of such amount shall not release any Grantor from any of its obligations under any of the other Transaction Documents.

^^Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9(b) hereof, each Grantor recognizes that the Agent may deem it impracticable to effect a public sale of all or any part of the Pledged Shares or any other securities constituting Pledged Interests and that the Agent may, therefore, determine to make one or more private sales of any such securities to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the seller than the prices and other terms which mi ght have been obtained at a public sale and, notwithstanding the foregoing, agrees that such private sales shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Agent shall have no obligation to delay the sale of any such securities for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer of such securities to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act. Each Grantor further acknowledges and agrees that any offer to sell such securities which has been (i) publicly advertised on a bona fide basis in a newspaper or other publication of general circulation in the financial community of New York, New York (to the extent that such an offer may be so advertised without prior registration under the Securities Act) or (ii) made privately in the manner described above to not less than fifteen **bona** **fide** offerees shall be deemed to i nvolve a "public disposition" for the purposes of Section 9-610(c) of the Code (or any successor or similar, applicable statutory provision) as then in effect in the State of New York, notwithstanding that such sale may not constitute a "public offering" under the Securities Act, and that the Agent may, in such event, bid for the purchase of such securities.

^^Any cash held by the Agent (or its agent or designee) as Collateral and all Cash Proceeds received by the Agent (or its agent or designee) in respect of any sale of or collection from, or other realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral may, in the discretion of the Agent, be held by the Agent (or its agent or designee) as collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter applied (after payment of any amounts payable to the Agent pursuant to Section 10 hereof) in whole or in part by the Agent against, all or any part of the Secured Obligations in such order as the Agent shall elect, consistent with the provisions of the Note and any other Transaction Documents. Any surplus of such cas h or Cash Proceeds held by the Agent (or its agent or designee) and remaining after the date on which all of the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash after the termination of each of the Transaction Documents, shall be paid over to whomsoever shall be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.

^^In the event that the proceeds of any such sale, collection or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the Agent and the Holders are legally entitled, the Grantors shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon at the highest rate specified in any applicable Transaction Document for interest on overdue principal thereof or such other rate as shall be fixed by applicable law, together with the costs of collection and the reasonable fees, costs, expenses and other client charges of any attorneys employed by the Agent to collect such deficiency.

^^Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that if the Agent complies with any applicable requirements of law in connection with a disposition of the Collateral, such compliance will not adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral.

^^The Agent shall not be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including, but not limited to, this Agreement and the Collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of, the Secured Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of the Agent's rights hereunder and in respect of such collateral security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights, however existing or arising. To the extent that any Grantor lawfully may, such Grantor hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshalling of collateral which might cause delay in or i mpede the enforcement of the Agent's rights under this Agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the Secured Obligations or under which any of the Secured Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the Secured Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, each Grantor hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws.

^**Indemnity and Expenses**.  
^^Each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and each other Indemnitee from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, obligations, penalties, fees, reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, expenses and disbursements) incurred by the Agent or such Indemnitee to the extent that they arise out of or otherwise result from or relate to or are in connection with this Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement of this Agreement), except claims, losses or liabilities resulting solely and directly from the Agent's or such Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

^^Each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to pay to the Agent upon demand the amount of any and all costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees, costs, expenses and disbursements of counsel for the Agent and of any experts and agents (including, without limitation, any collateral trustee which may act as agent of the Agent), which the Agent may incur in connection with (i) the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, recordation, administration, amendment, waiver or other modification or termination of this Agreement, (ii) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any Collateral, (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the Agent hereunder, or (iv) the failure by any Grantor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof.

^**Notices, Etc.** All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be given in accordance with the notice provision of the Purchase Agreement.

^**Security Interest Absolute; Joint and Several Obligations**.

^^All rights of the Secured Parties, all Liens and all obligations of each of the Grantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Note or any other Transaction Document, (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term in respect of, all or any of the Secured Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or consent to any departure from the Note or any other Transaction Document, (iii) any exchange or release of, or non-perfection of any Lien on any Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Secured Obligations, or (iv) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any of the Grantors in respect of the Secured Obligations. All authorizations and agencies contained herein with respect to any of the Collateral are irrevocable and powers coupled with an interest.

^^Each Grantor hereby waives (i) promptness and diligence, (ii) notice of any actions taken by the Agent, any Holder, any Guarantor or any other Person under any Transaction Document or any other agreement, document or instrument relating thereto, (iii) all other notices, demands and protests, and all other formalities of every kind in connection with the enforcement of the Secured Obligations, the omission of or delay in which, but for the provisions of this subsection (b), might constitute grounds for relieving such Grantor of any such Grantor's obligations hereunder and (v) any requirement that the Agent or any Holder protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or other lien on any property sub ject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against any Grantor or any other Person or any collateral.

^^All of the obligations of the Grantors hereunder are joint and several. The Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, enforce the provisions hereof against any of the Grantors and shall not be required to proceed against all Grantors jointly or seek payment from the Grantors ratably. In addition, the Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, select the Collateral of any one or more of the Grantors for sale or application to the Secured Obligations, without regard to the ownership of such Collateral, and shall not be required to make such selection ratably from the Collateral owned by all of the Grantors. The release or discharge of any Grantor by the Agent shall n ot release or discharge any other Grantor from the obligations of such Person hereunder.

^**Miscellaneous** .  
^^No amendment of any provision of this Agreement (including any Schedule attached hereto) shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by each Grantor affected thereby and the Agent, and no waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure by any Grantor therefrom, shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

^^No failure on the part of the Secured Parties to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any other Transaction Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The rights and remedies of the Secured Parties provided herein and in the other Transaction Documents are cumulative and are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided by law. The rights of the Secured Parties under any Transaction Document against any party thereto are not conditional or contingent on any attempt by such Person to exercise a ny of its rights under any other Transaction Document against such party or against any other Person, including but not limited to, any Grantor.

^^This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall (i) remain in full force and effect, subject to paragraph (e) below, until the date on which all of the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash after the termination of each of the Transaction Documents and (ii) be binding on each Grantor all other Persons who become bound as debtor to this Agreement in accordance with Section 9-203(d) of the Code, and shall inure, together with all rights and remedies of the Secured Parties hereunder, to the benefit of the Secured Parties and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of clause (ii) of the immed iately preceding sentence, the Secured Parties may assign or otherwise transfer their respective rights and obligations under this Agreement and any other Transaction Document to any other Person pursuant to the terms of the Note, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all of the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Secured Parties herein or otherwise. Upon any such assignment or transfer, all references in this Agreement to any Secured Party shall mean the assignee of any such Secured Party. None of the rights or obligations of any Grantor hereunder may be assigned or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of the Agent, and any such assignment or transfer shall be null and void.

^^Upon the date on which all of the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash after the termination of each of the Transaction Documents, (i) subject to paragraph (e) below, this Agreement and the security interests and licenses created hereby shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Grantors and (ii) the Agent will, upon the Grantors' request and at the Grantors' expense, without any representation, warranty or recourse whatsoever, (A) return to the Grantors (or whomsoever shall be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct) such of the Collateral as shall not have been sold or otherwise disp osed of or applied pursuant to the terms hereof and (B) execute and deliver to the Grantors (or authorized the filing of) such documents as the Grantors shall reasonably request to evidence such termination.

^^This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against any Grantor for liquidation or reorganization, should any Grantor become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of any creditor or creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of any Grantor's assets, and shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or performance of the Secured Obligations, or any part thereof, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee of the Secured Obligations, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent conveyance," or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Secured Obligations shall be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.

^^Upon the execution and delivery, or authentication, by any Person of a security agreement supplement in substantially the form of **Exhibit C** hereto (each a "**Security Agreement Supplement**"), (i) such Person shall be referred to as an "**Additional Grantor**" and shall be and become a Grantor, and each reference in this Agreement to "Grantor" shall also mean and be a reference to such Additional Grantor, and each reference in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to "Collateral" shall also mean and be a reference to the Collateral of such Additional Grantor and (ii) the supplemental **Schedules I-VIII** attached to each Security Agreement Supplement shall be [[Party 1]] into and become a part of and supplement **Schedules I-VIII**, respectively, hereto, and the Agent may attach such Schedules as supplements to such Schedules, and each reference to such Schedules shall mean and be a reference to such Schedules, as supplemented pursuant hereto.

^^Except to the extent expressly provided in any Transaction Document to the contrary, this Agreement and all obligations of Grantors hereunder shall be automatically released when the Notes have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full. Upon such satisfaction, Agent shall promptly return any pledged Collateral to Grantors, or to the Person or Persons legally entitled thereto, and promptly shall endorse, execute, deliver, record and file all instruments and documents or, at the election of Agent, authorize Grantors to do so on behalf of agent and the Secured Parties, and do all other acts and things, reasonably required for the return of the Col lateral to Grantors, or to the Person or Persons legally entitled thereto, and to evidence or document the release of Agent's and the Secured Parties' interests arising under this Agreement, all as reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Grantors.

^^**THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF LAW AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VALIDITY AND PERFECTION OR THE PERFECTION AND THE EFFECT OF PERFECTION OR NON-PERFECTION OF THE SECURITY INTEREST CREATED HEREBY, OR REMEDIES HEREUNDER, IN RESPECT OF ANY PARTICULAR COLLATERAL ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.**
