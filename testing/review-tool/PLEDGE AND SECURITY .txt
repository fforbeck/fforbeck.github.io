Each Grantor consents to the grant by each other Grantor of a Lien in all Investment Related Property to the Collateral Agent and without limiting the generality of the foregoing consents to the transfer of any Pledged Partnership Interest and any Pledged LLC Interest to the Collateral Agent or its designee following an Event of Default and to the substitution of the Collateral Agent or its designee as a partner in any partnership or as a member in any limited liability company with all the rights and powers related thereto.

^^**Timing and Notice**. With respect to any Collateral in existence on the Closing Date, each Grantor shall comply with the requirements of Section 4 on the date hereof and, with respect to any Collateral hereafter owned or acquired, such Grantor shall comply with such requirements as promptly as possible, but in any event, within 10 (ten) days of the end of each fiscal quarter of the applicable Grantor. Each Grantor shall promptly inform the Collateral Agent of its acquisition of any Collateral for which any action is required by Section 4 hereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the filing of any applications for, or the issuance or registration of, any Patents, Copyrights or Trademarks). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Grantor shall have 30 (thirty) days from the Closing Date to provide the Collateral Agent with Control over any Investment Accounts.

Such Grantor has not filed any certificates of dissolution or liquidation, any certificates of domestication, transfer or continuance in any other jurisdiction; and

Each Grantor shall supplement such schedules as necessary to ensure that such schedules are accurate on each Credit Date;

^^none of the Collateral constitutes, or is the Proceeds of, (1) Farm Products, (2) As-Extracted Collateral, (3) Manufactured Homes, (4) timber to be cut, or (5) aircraft, aircraft engines, satellites, ships or railroad rolling stock.

^^not more than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the value of all personal property included in the Collateral is located in any country other than the United States; and

^^no Excluded Asset is material to the business of such Grantor.

^^**Ownership of Collateral and Absence of Other Liens**.

^^it owns the Collateral purported to be owned by it or otherwise has the rights it purports to have in each item of Collateral and, as to all Collateral whether now existing or hereafter acquired, developed or created (including by way of lease or license), will continue to own or have such rights in each item of the Collateral (except as otherwise permitted by the Credit Agreement), in each case free and clear of any and all Liens, rights or claims of all other Persons, including, without limitation, liens arising as a result of such Grantor becoming bound (as a result of merger or otherwise) as debtor under a security agreement entered into by another Person other than any Permitted Liens; and

^^other than any financing statements filed in favor of the Collateral Agent, no effective financing statement, fixture filing or other instrument similar in effect under any applicable law covering all or any part of the Collateral is on file in any filing or recording office except for (x) financing statements for which duly authorized proper termination statements have been delivered to the Collateral Agent for filing and (y) financing statements filed in connection with Permitted Liens. Other than the Collateral Agent and any automatic control in favor of a Bank, Securities Intermediary or Commodity Intermediary maintaining a Deposit Account, Securities Account or Commodity Contract, no Person is in Control of any Collateral.

^^**Status of Security Interest.**   
^^upon the filing of financing statements naming each Grantor as “debtor” and the Collateral Agent as “secured party” and describing the Collateral in the filing offices set forth opposite such Grantor’s name on Schedule 5.4 hereof (as such schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time), the security interest of the Collateral Agent in all Collateral that can be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any jurisdiction will constitute a valid, perfected, first priority Lien subject in the case of priority only, to any Permitted Liens with respect to Collateral. Each agreement purporting to give the Collateral Agent Control over any Collateral is effective to establish the Collateral Agent’s Control of the Collateral subject thereto;

^^to the extent perfection or priority of the security interest therein is not subject to Article 9 of the UCC, upon recordation of the security interests granted hereunder in Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and exclusive Copyright Licenses in the applicable intellectual property registries, including but not limited to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, the security interests granted to the Collateral Agent hereunder shall constitute valid, perfected, first priority Liens (subject, in the case of priority only, to Permitted Liens);

^^each Grantor is in compliance with its obligations under Section 4 hereof.

^^**Goods & Receivables**.   
^^each Receivable (i) is and will be the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Account Debtor in respect thereof, representing an unsatisfied obligation of such Account Debtor, (ii) is and will be enforceable in accordance with its terms, (iii) is not and will not be subject to any credits, rights of recoupment, setoffs, defenses, taxes, counterclaims (except with respect to refunds, returns and allowances in the ordinary course of business with respect to damaged merchandise) and (iv) is and will be in compliance with all applicable laws, whether federal, state, local or foreign; and

^^No material Receivable requires the consent of the Account Debtor in respect thereof in connection with the security interest hereunder, except any consent which has been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5, the Collateral Agent acknowledges that certain of the Receivables of the Grantors are obligations of agencies or instrumentalities of the United States of America and certain states thereof (“**Government Receivables**”) and that applicable law may prohibit the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties from collecting Government Receivables directly from the Account Debtors.

^^**Pledged Equity Interests, Investment Related Property**.

^^it is the record and beneficial owner of the Pledged Equity Interests free of all Liens, rights or claims of other Persons and there are no outstanding warrants, options or other rights to purchase, or shareholder, voting trust or similar agreements outstanding with respect to, or property that is convertible into, or that requires the issuance or sale of, any Pledged Equity Interests;

^^no consent of any Person including any other general or limited partner, any other member of a limited liability company, any other shareholder or any other trust beneficiary is necessary or desirable in connection with the creation, perfection or first priority status of the security interest of the Collateral Agent in any Pledged Equity Interests or the exercise by the Collateral Agent of the voting or other rights provided for in this Agreement or the exercise of remedies in respect thereof except such as have been obtained; and

^^the Pledged LLC Interests and Pledged Partnership Interests on which liens are granted hereunder do not represent interests (1) that by their terms provide that they are securities governed by the uniform commercial code of an applicable jurisdiction, (2) that are dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or markets or (3) in issuers that are registered as investment companies.

^^**Intellectual Property**.   
^^it is the sole and exclusive owner of the entire right, title, and interest in and to all Intellectual Property listed on Schedule 5.2(II) (as such schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time), and owns or has the valid right to use and, where such Grantor does so, sublicense others to use, all other Intellectual Property used in or necessary to conduct its business, free and clear of all Liens, claims and licenses, except for Permitted Liens and the licenses set forth on Schedule 5.2(II) (as such schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time); and

^^no Intellectual Property is material to the business operations of the Grantors, taken as a whole.

^**COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS.**

**Each Grantor hereby covenants and agrees that:**

^^if any Equipment or Inventory in excess of $[[USD Value 1]] individually or $[[USD Value 1]] in the aggregate is in possession or control of any warehouseman, bailee or other third party (other than a Consignee under a Consignment for which such Grantor is the Consignor), each Grantor shall join with the Collateral Agent in notifying the third party of the Collateral Agent’s security interest and obtaining an acknowledgment from the third party that it is holding the Equipment and Inventory for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and will permit the Collateral Agent to have access to Equipment or Inventory for purposes of inspecting such Collateral or, following an Event of Default, to remove same from such premises if the Collateral Agent so elects; and with respect to any Goods in excess of $[[USD Value 1]] individually or $[[USD Value 1]] in the aggregate subject to a Consignment for which such Grantor is the Consignor, Grantor shall file appropriate financing statements against the Consignee and take such other action as may be necessary to ensure that the Grantor has a first priority perfected security interest in such Goods;

^^it shall keep and maintain at its own cost and expense satisfactory and complete records of the Receivables, including, but not limited to, the originals of all documentation with respect to all Receivables and records of all payments received and all credits granted on the Receivables, and all other dealings therewith;

^^^require any Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it shall at its expense and promptly upon request of the Collateral Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by the Collateral Agent and make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place to be designated by the Collateral Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties;

^^^enter onto the property where any Collateral is located and take possession thereof with or without judicial process;

^^^prior to the disposition of the Collateral, store, process, repair or recondition the Collateral or otherwise prepare the Collateral for disposition in any manner to the extent the Collateral Agent deems appropriate; and

^^^without notice except as specified below or under the UCC, sell, assign, lease, license (on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis) or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Collateral Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, at such time or times and at such price or prices and upon such other terms as the Collateral Agent may deem commercially reasonable.

^^The Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may be the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral at any public or private (to the extent the portion of the Collateral being privately sold is of a kind that is customarily sold on a recognized market or the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations) sale in accordance with the UCC and the Collateral Agent, as collateral agent for and representative of the Secured Parties, shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale made in accordance with the UCC, to use and apply any of the Secured Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by applicable law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten (10) days notice to such Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Each Grantor agrees that it would not be commercially unreasonable for the Collateral Agent to dispose of the Collateral or any portion thereof by using Internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capability of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets. Each Grantor hereby waives any claims against the Collateral Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree. If the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all the Secured Obligations, Grantors shall be liable for the deficiency and the fees of any attorneys employed by the Collateral Agent to collect such deficiency. Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section will cause irreparable injury to the Collateral Agent, that the Collateral Agent has no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no default has occurred giving rise to the Secured Obligations becoming due and payable prior to their stated maturities. Nothing in this Section shall in any way limit the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder.

^^The Collateral Agent may sell the Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Collateral. The Collateral Agent may specifically disclaim or modify any warranties of title or the like. This procedure will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.

^^The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to marshal any of the Collateral.

^^**Application of Proceeds**. Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all proceeds received by the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, any collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied in full or in part by the Collateral Agent against, the Secured Obligations in the following order of priority: **first**, to the payment of all costs and expenses of such sale, collection or other realization, including reasonable compensation to the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and all other expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent in connection therewith, and all amounts for which the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent is entitled to indemnification hereunder (in its capacity as the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent and not as a Lender) and all advances made by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Grantor, and to the payment of all costs and expenses paid or incurred by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under the Credit Agreement, all in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof; **second**, to the extent of any excess of such proceeds, to the payment of all other Secured Obligations for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and the Lender Counterparties; and **third**, to the extent of any excess of such proceeds, to the payment to or upon the order of the applicable Grantor or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

^^**Sales on Credit**. If Collateral Agent sells any of the Collateral upon credit, Grantor will be credited only with payments actually made by purchaser and received by Collateral Agent and applied to indebtedness of the purchaser. In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral, Collateral Agent may resell the Collateral and Grantor shall be credited with proceeds of the sale.

^^**Investment Related Property**. Each Grantor recognizes that, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, the Collateral Agent may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Investment Related Property conducted without prior registration or qualification of such Investment Related Property under the Securities Act and/or such state securities laws, to limit purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire the Investment Related Property for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at prices and on terms less favorable than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including a public offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act) and, notwithstanding such circumstances, each Grantor agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any Investment Related Property for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register it for a form of public sale requiring registration under the Securities Act or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would, or should, agree to so register it. If the Collateral Agent determines to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Investment Related Property, upon written request, each Grantor shall and shall cause each issuer of any Pledged Stock to be sold hereunder, each partnership and each limited liability company from time to time to furnish to the Collateral Agent all such information as the Collateral Agent may request in order to determine the number and nature of interest, shares or other instruments included in the Investment Related Property which may be sold by the Collateral Agent in exempt transactions under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, as the same are from time to time in effect.

^^**Grant of Intellectual Property License**. For the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent, during the continuance of an Event of Default, to exercise rights and remedies under Section 9 hereof at such time as the Collateral Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, and for no other purpose, each Grantor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, to the extent assignable, an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to such Grantor), subject, in the case of Trademarks, to sufficient rights to quality control and inspection in favor of such Grantor to avoid the risk of invalidation of such Trademarks, to use, assign, license or sublicense any of the Intellectual Property now owned or hereafter acquired, developed or created by such Grantor, wherever the same may be located. Such license shall include access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer programs used for the compilation or printout hereof.

^^**Intellectual Property.**

^^Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in addition to the other rights and remedies provided herein, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default:

^^^the Collateral Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to bring suit or otherwise commence any action or proceeding in the name of any Grantor, the Collateral Agent or otherwise, in the Collateral Agent’s sole discretion, to enforce any Intellectual Property rights of such Grantor, in which event such Grantor shall, at the request of the Collateral Agent, do any and all lawful acts and execute any and all documents required by the Collateral Agent in aid of such enforcement, and such Grantor shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse and indemnify the Collateral Agent as provided in Section 12 hereof in connection with the exercise of its rights under this Section 9.6, and, to the extent that the Collateral Agent shall elect not to bring suit to enforce any Intellectual Property rights as provided in this Section 9.6, each Grantor agrees to use all reasonable measures, whether by action, suit, proceeding or otherwise, to prevent the infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation of any of such Grantor’s rights in the Intellectual Property by others and for that purpose agrees to diligently maintain any action, suit or proceeding against any Person so infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating as shall be necessary to prevent such infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation;

^^^upon written demand from the Collateral Agent, each Grantor shall grant, assign, convey or otherwise transfer to the Collateral Agent or such Collateral Agent’s designee all of such Grantor’s right, title and interest in and to any Intellectual Property and shall execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent such documents as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement;

^^^each Grantor agrees that such an assignment and/or recording shall be applied to reduce the Secured Obligations outstanding only to the extent that the Collateral Agent (or any other Secured Party) receives cash proceeds in respect of the sale of, or other realization upon, any such Intellectual Property;

^^^within five (5) Business Days after written notice from the Collateral Agent, each Grantor shall make available to the Collateral Agent, to the extent within such Grantor’s power and authority, such personnel in such Grantor’s employ on the date of such Event of Default as the Collateral Agent may reasonably designate, by name, title or job responsibility, to permit such Grantor to continue, directly or indirectly, to produce, advertise and sell the products and services sold or delivered by such Grantor under or in connection with any Trademarks or Trademark Licenses, such persons to be available to perform their prior functions on the Collateral Agent’s behalf and to be compensated by the Collateral Agent at such Grantor’s expense on a per diem, pro-rata basis consistent with the salary and benefit structure applicable to each as of the date of such Event of Default; and

^^^the Collateral Agent shall have the right to notify, or require each Grantor to notify, any obligors with respect to amounts due or to become due to such Grantor in respect of any Intellectual Property of such Grantor, of the existence of the security interest created herein, to direct such obligors to make payment of all such amounts directly to the Collateral Agent, and, upon such notification and at the expense of such Grantor, to enforce collection of any such amounts and to adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent as such Grantor might have done;

^all amounts and proceeds (including checks and other instruments) received by Grantor in respect of amounts due to such Grantor in respect of the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent hereunder, shall be segregated from other funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over or delivered to the Collateral Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement) to be held as cash Collateral and applied as provided by Section 9.7 hereof; and

^Grantor shall not adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment of any such amount or release wholly or partly any obligor with respect thereto or allow any credit or discount thereon.

^^If (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and, by reason of cure, waiver, modification, amendment or otherwise, no longer be continuing, (ii) no other Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (iii) an assignment or other transfer to the Collateral Agent of any rights, title and interests in and to any Intellectual Property of such Grantor shall have been previously made and shall have become absolute and effective, and (iv) the Secured Obligations shall not have become immediately due and payable, upon the written request of any Grantor, the Collateral Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to such Grantor, at such Grantor’s sole cost and expense, such assignments or other transfer as may be necessary to reassign to such Grantor any such rights, title and interests as may have been assigned to the Collateral Agent as aforesaid, subject to any disposition thereof that may have been made by the Collateral Agent; provided, after giving effect to such reassignment, the Collateral Agent’s security interest granted pursuant hereto, as well as all other rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent granted hereunder, shall continue to be in full force and effect; and provided further, the rights, title and interests so reassigned shall be free and clear of any other Liens granted by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties.

^^**Cash Proceeds; Deposit Accounts**. (a) If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in addition to the rights of the Collateral Agent specified in Section 6.5 with respect to payments of Receivables, all proceeds of any Collateral received by any Grantor consisting of cash, checks and other near-cash items (collectively, “**Cash Proceeds**”) shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Collateral Agent, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, be turned over to the Collateral Agent in the exact form received by such Grantor (duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Collateral Agent, if required) and held by the Collateral Agent in the Collateral Account. Any Cash Proceeds received by the Collateral Agent (whether from a Grantor or otherwise) may, in the sole discretion of the Collateral Agent, (A) be held by the Collateral Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, as collateral security for the Secured Obligations (whether matured or unmatured) and/or (B) then or at any time thereafter may be applied by the Collateral Agent against the Secured Obligations then due and owing.

^^If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent may apply the balance from any Deposit Account or instruct the bank at which any Deposit Account is maintained to pay the balance of any Deposit Account to or for the benefit of the Collateral Agent.

^**COLLATERAL AGENT.**

The Collateral Agent has been appointed to act as Collateral Agent hereunder by Lenders and, by their acceptance of the benefits hereof, the other Secured Parties. The Collateral Agent shall be obligated, and shall have the right hereunder, to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking any action (including, without limitation, the release or substitution of Collateral), solely in accordance with this Agreement and the Credit Agreement; provided, the Collateral Agent shall, after payment in full of all Obligations under the Credit Agreement, exercise, or refrain from exercising, any remedies provided for herein in accordance with the instructions of the holders (the “**Majority Holders**”) of a majority of the aggregate “settlement amount” as defined in the Hedge Agreements (or, with respect to any Hedge Agreement that has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the amount then due and payable (exclusive of expenses and similar payments but including any early termination payments then due) under such Hedge Agreement) under all Hedge Agreements. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, settlement amount for any Hedge Agreement that has not been terminated shall be the settlement amount as of the last Business Day of the month preceding any date of determination and shall be calculated by the appropriate swap counterparties and reported to the Collateral Agent upon request; provided any Hedge Agreement with a settlement amount that is a negative number shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the Majority Holders. In furtherance of the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Secured Party, by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, agrees that it shall have no right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral hereunder, it being understood and agreed by such Secured Party that all rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Collateral Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties in accordance with the terms of this Section. The provisions of the Credit Agreement relating to the Collateral Agent including, without limitation, the provisions relating to resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent and the powers and duties and immunities of the Collateral Agent are incorporated herein by this reference and shall survive any termination of the Credit Agreement.

^**CONTINUING SECURITY INTEREST; TRANSFER OF LOANS.**

This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall remain in full force and effect until the payment in full of all Secured Obligations (subject to the Borrower’s right pursuant to Section 9.08(d) of the Credit Agreement to request termination of the security interest upon payment in full of all of the Secured Obligations other than the Hedging Obligations), the cancellation or termination of the Commitments and the cancellation, expiration, posting of backstop letters of credit or cash collateralization of all outstanding Letters of Credit satisfactory to the issuer(s) of such Letters of Credit, be binding upon each Grantor, its successors and assigns, and inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and its successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any Loans held by it to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to Lenders herein or otherwise. Upon the payment in full of all Secured Obligations, the cancellation or termination of the Commitments and the cancellation, expiration, posting of backstop letters of credit or cash collateralization of all outstanding Letters of Credit satisfactory to the issuer(s) of such Letters of Credit, the security interest granted hereby shall automatically terminate hereunder and of record and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Grantors. Upon any such termination the Collateral Agent shall, at the Grantors’ expense, execute and deliver to the Grantors or otherwise authorize the filing of such documents as the Grantors shall reasonably request, including financing statement amendments to evidence such termination. Upon any disposition of property permitted by the Credit Agreement, the Liens granted herein shall be deemed to be automatically released and such property shall automatically revert to the applicable Grantor with no further action on the part of any Person. The Collateral Agent shall, at the applicable Grantor’s expense, execute and deliver or otherwise authorize the filing of such documents as such Grantor shall reasonably request, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, including financing statement amendments to evidence such release.

^**STANDARD OF CARE; COLLATERAL AGENT MAY PERFORM.**

The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the exercise of reasonable care in the custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Collateral Agent accords its own property. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon all or any part of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or otherwise. If any Grantor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, the Collateral Agent may itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by each Grantor under Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement.

^**MISCELLANEOUS.**

Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be given in accordance with Section 10.01 of the Credit Agreement. No failure or delay on the part of the Collateral Agent in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under the Credit Agreement shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement and the Credit Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Grantors and their respective successors and assigns. No Grantor shall, without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent given in accordance with the Credit Agreement, assign any right, duty or obligation hereunder. This Agreement and the Credit Agreement embody the entire agreement and understanding between the Grantors and the Collateral Agent and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between such parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Accordingly, the Credit Agreement may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument; signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same document.

**THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND ALL CLAIMS AND CONTROVERSIES ARISING OUT OF THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT LAW, TORT LAW OR OTHERWISE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PROVISIONS THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER LAW (OTHER THAN ANY MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF THE UCC RELATING TO THE LAW GOVERNING PERFECTION AND THE EFFECT OF PERFECTION OF THE SECURITY INTEREST).**

**THE PROVISIONS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT UNDER THE HEADINGS “CONSENT TO JURISDICTION” AND “WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL” ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY THIS REFERENCE AND SUCH INCORPORATION SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.**

\centered [Remainder of page intentionally left blank]

TO PLEDGE AND SECURITY AGREEMENT  

\centered **SECURITIES ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT**

This Securities Account Control Agreement dated as of [_________], 20[__] (this **“Agreement”**) among [___________________] (the **“Debtor”**), Barclays Bank PLC, as collateral agent for the Secured Parties (together with its successors and assigns, the **“Collateral Agent”**) and [___________________], in its capacity as a “securities intermediary” as defined in Section 8-102 of the UCC (in such capacity, the **“Securities Intermediary”**). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the Pledge and Security Agreement, dated as of [[Date 1]], among the Debtor, the other Grantors party thereto and the Collateral Agent (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the **“Security Agreement”**). All references herein to the **“UCC”** shall mean the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York.

**Section** 1**. Establishment of Securities Account**. The Securities Intermediary hereby confirms and agrees that:

^^The Securities Intermediary has established account number **[IDENTIFY ACCOUNT NUMBER]** in the name **“[IDENTIFY EXACT TITLE OF ACCOUNT]”** (such account and any successor account, the **“Securities Account”**) and the Securities Intermediary shall not change the name or account number of the Securities Account without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent;

^^All securities or other property underlying any financial assets credited to the Securities Account shall be registered in the name of the Securities Intermediary, indorsed to the Securities Intermediary or in blank or credited to another securities account maintained in the name of the Securities Intermediary and in no case will any financial asset credited to the Securities Account be registered in the name of the Debtor, payable to the order of the Debtor or specially indorsed to the Debtor except to the extent the foregoing have been specially indorsed to the Securities Intermediary or in blank;

^^All property delivered to the Securities Intermediary pursuant to the Security Agreement will be promptly credited to the Securities Account; and

**Section** 2**. “Financial Assets” Election**. The Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that each item of property (including, without limitation, any investment property, financial asset, security, instrument, general intangible or cash) credited to the Securities Account shall be treated as a “financial asset” within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC.

**Section** 3**. Control of the Securities Account**. If at any time the Securities Intermediary shall receive any order from the Collateral Agent directing transfer or redemption of any financial asset relating to the Securities Account, the Securities Intermediary shall comply with such entitlement order without further consent by the Debtor or any other person. If the Debtor is otherwise entitled to issue entitlement orders and such orders conflict with any entitlement order issued by the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary shall follow the orders issued by the Collateral Agent.

\centered EXHIBIT C-1

**Section** 4**. Subordination of Lien; Waiver of Set-Off**. In the event that the Securities Intermediary has or subsequently obtains by agreement, by operation of law or otherwise a security interest in the Securities Account or any security entitlement credited thereto, the Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that such security interest shall be subordinate to the security interest of the Collateral Agent. The financial assets and other items deposited to the Securities Account will not be subject to deduction, set-off, banker’s lien, or any other right in favor of any person other than the Collateral Agent (except that the Securities Intermediary may set off (i) all amounts due to the Securities Intermediary in respect of customary fees and expenses for the routine maintenance and operation of the Securities Account and (ii) the face amount of any checks which have been credited to such Securities Account but are subsequently returned unpaid because of uncollected or insufficient funds).

**Section** 5**. Choice of Law**. This Agreement and the Securities Account shall each be governed by the laws of the State of New York. Regardless of any provision in any other agreement, for purposes of the UCC, New York shall be deemed to be the Securities Intermediary’s jurisdiction (within the meaning of Section 8-110 of the UCC) and the Securities Account (as well as the securities entitlements related thereto) shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

**Section** 6**. Conflict with Other Agreements**.

^^In the event of any conflict between this Agreement (or any portion thereof) and any other agreement now existing or hereafter entered into, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail;

^^No amendment or modification of this Agreement or waiver of any right hereunder shall be binding on any party hereto unless it is in writing and is signed by all of the parties hereto;

^^The Securities Intermediary hereby confirms and agrees that:

^^^There are no other control agreements entered into between the Securities Intermediary and the Debtor with respect to the Securities Account;

^^^It has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement, will not enter into, any agreement with any other person relating to the Securities Account and/or any financial assets credited thereto pursuant to which it has agreed to comply with entitlement orders (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(8) of the UCC) of such other person; and

^^^It has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement, will not enter into, any agreement with the Debtor or the Collateral Agent purporting to limit or condition the obligation of the Securities Intermediary to comply with entitlement orders as set forth in Section 3 hereof.

**Section** 7**. Adverse Claims**. Except for the claims and interest of the Collateral Agent and of the Debtor in the Securities Account, the Securities Intermediary does not know of any claim to, or interest in, the Securities Account or in any “financial asset” (as defined in Section 8-102(a) of the UCC) credited thereto. If any person asserts any lien, encumbrance or adverse claim (including any writ, garnishment, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process) against the Securities Account or in any financial asset carried therein, the Securities Intermediary will promptly notify the Collateral Agent and the Debtor thereof.

^^**Voting Rights**. Until such time as the Securities Intermediary receives a Notice of Sole Control pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 8, the Debtor shall direct the Securities Intermediary with respect to the voting of any financial assets credited to the Securities Account.

^^**Statements and Confirmations**. The Securities Intermediary will promptly send copies of all statements, confirmations and other correspondence concerning the Securities Account and/or any financial assets credited thereto simultaneously to each of the Debtor and the Collateral Agent at the address for each set forth in Section 12 of this Agreement.

^^**Tax Reporting**. All items of income, gain, expense and loss recognized in the Securities Account shall be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and all state and local taxing authorities under the name and taxpayer identification number of the Debtor.

TO PLEDGE AND SECURITY AGREEMENT  

\centered **DEPOSIT ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT**

This Deposit Account Control Agreement dated as of [_________], 20[__] (this **“Agreement”**) among [___________] (the **“Debtor”**), Barclays Bank PLC, as collateral agent for the Secured Parties (together with its successors and assigns, the **“Collateral Agent”**) and [____________], in its capacity as a “bank” as defined in Section 9-102 of the UCC (in such capacity, the **“Financial Institution”**). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the Pledge and Security Agreement, dated as of [[Date 1]], between the Debtor, the other Grantors party thereto and the Collateral Agent (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the **“Security Agreement”**). All references herein to the “UCC” shall mean the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York.

^Establishment of Deposit Account. The Financial Institution hereby confirms and agrees that:

^^The Financial Institution has established account number **[IDENTIFY ACCOUNT NUMBER]** in the name **“[IDENTIFY EXACT TITLE OF ACCOUNT]”** (such account and any successor account, the **“Deposit Account”**) and the Financial Institution shall not change the name or account number of the Deposit Account without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent and, prior to delivery of a Notice of Sole Control in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, the Debtor; and

^^The Deposit Account is a “deposit account” within the meaning of Section 9-102(a)(29) of the UCC.

^Control of the Deposit Account. If at any time the Financial Institution shall receive any instructions originated by the Collateral Agent directing the disposition of funds in the Deposit Account, the Financial Institution shall comply with such instructions without further consent by the Debtor or any other person. The Financial Institution hereby acknowledges that it has received notice of the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Deposit Account and hereby acknowledges and consents to such lien. If the Debtor is otherwise entitled to issue instructions and such instructions conflict with any instructions issued the Collateral Agent, the Financial Institution shall follow the instructions issued by the Collateral Agent.

^Subordination of Lien; Waiver of Set-Off. In the event that the Financial Institution has or subsequently obtains by agreement, by operation of law or otherwise a security interest in the Deposit Account or any funds credited thereto, the Financial Institution hereby agrees that such security interest shall be subordinate to the security interest of the Collateral Agent. Money and other items credited to the Deposit Account will not be subject to deduction, set-off, banker’s lien, or any other right in favor of any person other than the Collateral Agent (except that the Financial Institution may set off (i) all amounts due to the Financial Institution in respect of customary fees and expenses for the routine maintenance and operation of the Deposit Account and (ii) the face amount of any checks which have been credited to such Deposit Account but are subsequently returned unpaid because of uncollected or insufficient funds).

\centered EXHIBIT D-1

^Choice of Law. This Agreement and the Deposit Account shall each be governed by the laws of the State of New York. Regardless of any provision in any other agreement, for purposes of the UCC, New York shall be deemed to be the Financial Institution’s jurisdiction (within the meaning of Section 9-304 of the UCC) and the Deposit Account shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

^Conflict with Other Agreements.

^^In the event of any conflict between this Agreement (or any portion thereof) and any other agreement now existing or hereafter entered into, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail;

^^No amendment or modification of this Agreement or waiver of any right hereunder shall be binding on any party hereto unless it is in writing and is signed by all of the parties hereto; and

^^The Financial Institution hereby confirms and agrees that:

^^^There are no other agreements entered into between the Financial Institution and the Debtor with respect to the Deposit Account [other than ____________]; and

^^^It has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement, will not enter into, any agreement with any other person relating the Deposit Account and/or any funds credited thereto pursuant to which it has agreed to comply with instructions originated by such persons as contemplated by Section 9-104 of the UCC.

^Adverse Claims. The Financial Institution does not know of any liens, claims or encumbrances relating to the Deposit Account. If any person asserts any lien, encumbrance or adverse claim (including any writ, garnishment, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process) against the Deposit Account, the Financial Institution will promptly notify the Collateral Agent and the Debtor thereof.

^Maintenance of Deposit Account. In addition to, and not in lieu of, the obligation of the Financial Institution to honor instructions as set forth in Section 2 hereof, the Financial Institution agrees to maintain the Deposit Account as follows:

^^**Notice of Sole Control**. If at any time the Collateral Agent delivers to the Financial Institution a Notice of Sole Control in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, the Financial Institution agrees that after receipt of such notice, it will take all instruction with respect to the Deposit Account solely from the Collateral Agent.

^^**Statements and Confirmations**. The Financial Institution will promptly send copies of all statements, confirmations and other correspondence concerning the Deposit Account simultaneously to each of the Debtor and the Collateral Agent at the address for each set forth in Section 11 of this Agreement; and

^^**Tax Reporting**. All interest, if any, relating to the Deposit Account, shall be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and all state and local taxing authorities under the name and taxpayer identification number of the Debtor.

^Successors; Assignment. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective corporate successors or heirs and personal representatives who obtain such rights solely by operation of law. The Collateral Agent may assign its rights hereunder only with the express written consent of the Financial Institution and by sending written notice of such assignment to the Debtor.
