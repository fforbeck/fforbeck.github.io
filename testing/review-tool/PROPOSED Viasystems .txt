^**Grant of the Option**. The Company hereby grants to the Participant the right and option (the “Option”) to purchase, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, all or any part of an aggregate of [________] Shares, subject to adjustment as set forth 

in the Plan. The Option is intended to be a nonqualified stock option, and is not intended to be treated as an option that complies with Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

^**Option Price**. The purchase price of the Shares subject to the Option shall be $[____] per Share (the “Option Price”), subject to adjustment as set forth in the Plan.

two-thirds of the Option shall vest in equal installments at the end of each of the next eight (8) ensuing calendar quarters.

At any time, the portion of the Option which has become vested as described in this Section 3 is hereinafter referred to as the “Vested Portion.” The Vested Portion of the Option shall remain exercisable for the period set forth in Section 6.

^**Accelerated Vesting**. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary:

^^In the event the Participant’s Service terminates due to death or Disability prior to the first anniversary of the Date of Grant, the unvested portion of the Option shall vest on a pro rata basis based on the ratio of (i) the number of complete months beginning on 

the Date of Grant and ending on the date of the Participant’s termination of Service to (ii) thirty-six (36).

^^Immediately prior to a Change in Control, the unvested portion of the Option shall become fully vested and exercisable as of such date of the Change of Control and shall remain exercisable for, and shall otherwise terminate and thereafter be forfeited at the end 

of, a period of 90 days following the Change of Control.

^**Forfeiture**. Except as otherwise provided herein, if the Participant’s Service is terminated for any reason, the Option shall, to the extent not then vested as of the Termination Date, be cancelled by the Company without consideration and the Vested Portion of the

^^^the 7th anniversary of the Date of Grant;

^^^the date that is one (1) year following termination of the Participant’s Service;

^^**Method of Exercise**.  
^^^Subject to Section 4, the Vested Portion of the Option may be exercised by delivering to the Company at its principal office written notice of intent to so exercise; **provided** that the Option may be exercised with respect to whole Shares only. Such notice 

shall specify the number of Shares for which the Option is being exercised and shall be accompanied by payment in full of the Option Price. In the event the Option is being exercised by the Participant’s representative, the notice shall be accompanied by 

proof (satisfactory to the Committee) of the representative’s right to exercise the Option. The payment of the Option Price may be made at the election of the Participant (A) in cash or its equivalent (e.g., by cashier’s check), (B) to the extent permitted by the 

Committee, in Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Committee, (C) partly in cash and, to the extent permitted by the Committee, 

partly in such Shares, (D) to the extent permitted by the Committee, by reducing the number of Shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the Option by the number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the Option Price, or (E) if there is a public 

market for the Shares at such time, subject to such requirements as may be imposed by the Committee, through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares obtained upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the Company 

an amount out of the proceeds of such sale equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased. The Committee may prescribe any other method of payment that it determines to be consistent with applicable law. Neither the Participant nor the 

Participant’s representative shall have any rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares subject to an Option until the Participant has given written notice of exercise of the Option, paid in full for such Shares and, if applicable, has 

satisfied any other conditions imposed by the Committee pursuant to the Plan.

^^^Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, the Option may not be exercised prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the Option or the Shares under applicable securities or other laws, or 

under any ruling or regulation of any governmental body or national securities exchange that the Committee shall in its sole discretion determine to be necessary or advisable.

^^^Upon the Company’s determination that the Option has been validly exercised as to any of the Shares, the Company shall issue certificates in the Participant’s name for such Shares. However, the Company shall not be liable to the Participant for damages 

relating to any delays in issuing the certificates to him, any loss of the certificates, or any mistakes or errors in the issuance of the certificates or in the certificates themselves.

^^^In the event of the Participant’s death, the Vested Portion of the Option shall remain exercisable during the period set forth in Section 6 by the Participant’s executor or administrator, or the person or persons to whom the Participant’s rights under this 

Award Agreement shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution as the case may be. Any heir or legatee of the Participant shall take rights herein granted subject to the terms and conditions hereof.

^**No Right to Continued Service**. The granting of the Option evidenced hereby and this Award Agreement shall impose no obligation on the Company or any Affiliate to continue the Service of the Participant and shall not lessen or affect any right that the Company 

or any Affiliate may have to terminate the Service of such Participant.

^**Securities Laws/Legend on Certificates**. The issuance and delivery of Shares shall comply with all applicable requirements of law, including (without limitation) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, state securities 

laws and regulations, and the regulations of any stock exchange or other securities market on which the Company’s securities may then be traded. If the Company deems it necessary to ensure that the issuance of securities under the Plan is not required to be 

registered under any applicable securities laws, each Participant to whom such security would be issued shall deliver to the Company an agreement or certificate containing such representations, warranties and covenants as the Company may deem necessary which 

satisfies such requirements. The certificates representing the Shares shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem reasonably advisable, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such 

certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

^**Transferability**. The Option may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, 

attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate; **provided** that the designation of a beneficiary shall not constitute an assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance. No such 

permitted transfer of the Option to heirs or legatees of the Participant shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with written notice thereof and a copy of such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the 

validity of the transfer and the acceptance by the transferee or transferees of the terms and conditions hereof. During the Participant’s lifetime, the Option is exercisable only by the Participant.

^**Adjustment of Option**. Adjustments to the Option (or any of the Shares underlying the Option) shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

transfer under or with respect to the Option and to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Committee to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such withholding taxes.
