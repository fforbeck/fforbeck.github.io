^**Conflicting Interest Transactions.** As used in this paragraph, "conflicting interest transactions" means any of the following: (i) a loan or other assistance by the corporation to a director of the corporation or to an entity in which a director of the corporation is a director or officer or has a financial interest; (ii) a guaranty by the corporation of an obligation of a director of the corporation or of an obligation of an entity in which a director of the corporation is a director or officer or has a financial interest; or (iii) a contract or transaction between the corporation and a director of the corporation or between the corporation and an entity in which a director of the corporation is a director or officer or has a financial interest. No conflicting interest transaction shall be void or voidable, be enjoined, be set aside, or give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions in a proceeding by a shareholder or by or in the right of the corporation, solely because the conflicting interest transaction involves a director of the corporation or an entity in which a director of the corporation is a director or officer or has a financial interest, or solely because the director is present at or participates in the meeting of the corporation's board of directors or of the committee of the board of directors which authorizes, approves or ratifies a conflicting interest transaction, or solely because the director's vote is counted for such purpose, if: (a) the material facts as to the director's relationship or interest and as to the conflicting interest transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors or the committee, and the board of directors or committee in good faith authorizes, approves or ratifies the conflicting interest transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors are less than quorum; or (b) the material facts as to the director's relationship or interest and as to the conflicting interest transaction are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote thereon, and the conflicting interest transaction is specifically authorized, approved or ratified in good faith by a vote of the shareholders; or (c) a conflicting interest transaction is fair as to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the board of directors, a committee thereof, or the shareholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the board of directors or of a committee which authorizes, approves or ratifies the conflicting interest transaction.

^**Loans and Guarantees for the Benefit of Directors.** Neither the board of directors nor any committee thereof shall authorize a loan by the corporation to a director of the corporation or to an entity in which a director of the corporation is a director or officer or has a financial interest, or a guaranty by the corporation of an obligation of a director of the corporation or of an obligation of an entity in which a director of the corporation is a director or officer or has a financial interest, until at least ten days written notice of the proposed authorization of the loan or guaranty has been given to the shareholders who would be entitled to vote thereon if the issue of the loan or guaranty were submitted to a vote of the shareholders. The requirements of this subparagraph B are in addition to, and not in substitution for, the provisions of subparagraph A of this Article.

^**Indemnification.** The corporation shall indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any person who is or was a director, officer, agent, fiduciary or employee of the corporation against any claim, liability or expense arising against or incurred by such person made party to a proceeding because he is or was a director, officer, agent, fiduciary or employee of the corporation or because he is or was serving another entity or employee benefit plan as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, fiduciary or agent at the corporation's request. The corporation shall further have the authority to the maximum extent permitted by law to purchase and maintain insurance providing such indemnification.

^**Limitation on Director's Liability.** No director of this corporation shall have any personal liability for monetary damages to the corporation or its shareholders for beach of his fiduciary duty as a director, except that this provision shall not eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for: (i) any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders; (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) voting for or assenting to a distribution in violation of Colorado Revised Statutes § 7-106-401 or the Articles of Incorporation if it is established that the director did not perform his duties in compliance with Colorado Revised Statutes § 7-108-401, provided that the personal liability of a director in this circumstances shall be limited to the amount of the distribution which exceeds what could have been distributed without violation of Colorado Revised Statutes § 7-106-401 or the Articles of Incorporation; or (iv) any transaction from which the director directly or indirectly derives an improper personal benefit. Nothing contained herein will be construed to deprive any director of his right to all defenses ordinarily available to a director nor will anything herein be construed to deprive any director of any right he may have for contribution from any other director or other person.

^**Negation of Equitable Interests in Shares or Rights.** Unless a person is recognized as a shareholder through procedures established by the corporation pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes § 7-107-204 or any similar law, the corporation shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any shares of the corporation as the owner thereof for all purposes permitted by the Colorado Business Corporation Act, including without limitation all rights deriving from such shares, and the corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such shares or rights deriving from such shares on the part of any other person including without limitation, a purchaser, assignee or transferee of such shares, unless and until such other person becomes the registered holder of such shares or is recognized as such, whether or not the corporation shall have either actual or constructive notice of the claimed interest of such other person. By way of example and not of limitation, until such other person has become the registered holder of such shares or is recognized pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes § 7-107-204 or any similar applicable law, he shall not be entitled: (i) to receive notice or the meetings of the shareholders; (ii) to vote at such meetings; (iii) to examine a list of the shareholders; (iv) to be paid dividends or other distributions payable to shareholders; or (v) to own, enjoy and exercise any other rights deriving from such shares against the corporation. Nothing contained herein will be construed to deprive any beneficial shareholder, as defined in Colorado Revised Statutes § 7-113-101(1), of any right he may have pursuant to Article 113 of the Colorado Business Corporation Act or any subsequent law.
