The Pricing Agreement shall specify, with respect to the purchase and sale of the Designated Securities pursuant thereto, (a) in Schedule I thereto (i) the names of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities and (ii) the principal amount of Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter at the Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof) and (b) in Schedule II thereto (i) the title or titles of the Designated Securities, (ii) the aggregate principal amount or amounts of the Designated Securities, (iii) the price or prices of the Designated Securities to the public, (iv) the purchase price or prices of the Designated Securities to the Underwriters, and, to the extent applicable, any selling concession or concessions and reallowance concession or concessions applicable to the Underwriters and dealers, as the case may be, (v) specified funds, if not immediately available funds, for payment 

of the purchase price for the Designated Securities, (vi) the title of the Indenture under which the Designated Securities are being issued, (vii) the maturity or maturities of the Designated Securities, (viii) the interest rate or rates of the Designated Securities or the manner in which the interest rate or rates are to be determined, (ix) the interest payment dates of the Designated Securities, (x) the record dates for the payment of interest on the Designated Securities, (xi) the redemption provisions, if any, of the Designated Securities, (xii) the sinking fund provisions, if any, of the Designated Securities, (xiii) the Time of Delivery, (xiv) the closing location with respect to the closing of the sale of the Designated Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement, (xv) the name or names and address or addresses of the Representatives of the Underwriters, (xvi) such other terms, conditions and other provisions of the Designated Securities as are established in accordance with the Indenture and (xvii) such other terms, conditions and other provisions that supplement, amend or modify this Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities or the Indenture. The Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company’s counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto, and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Pricing Agreement, the Indenture, any “Blue Sky” and Legal Investment Memoranda and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(b) hereof (including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the “Blue Sky” and legal investment surveys); (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of any indenture trustee and any agent of any Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for any indenture trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities; and (vii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section 7.

^^^To the best knowledge of such counsel and other than as set forth in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is the subject that, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders’ equity, results of operations or internal control over financial reporting of the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise; and, to the best knowledge of such counsel, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or others; 

^^^This Agreement and the Pricing Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;

^^^No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Designated Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Pricing Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or “Blue Sky” laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Securities by the Underwriters; 

^^^The documents [[Exchange Act]] by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto made prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and any other financial data included or [[Exchange Act]] by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder;

^^^To the best of such counsel’s knowledge, there is no amendment to the Registration Statement that is required to be filed and no contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be [[Exchange Act]] by reference into the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that are not so filed or [[Exchange Act]] by reference or described; 

^^^The statements made in any tax consequences or tax considerations sections in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, and in any amendment or supplement thereto, insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects; and

^^^None of the Company and its significant subsidiaries that are [[Exchange Act]] or organized under the laws of the United States or a state thereof is an “investment company” within the meaning of, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 

In addition, in such opinion or in a separate letter such counsel shall state that such counsel has no reason to believe that (A) as of its applicable effective dates, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and any other financial data included or [[Exchange Act]] by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (B) as of its issue date, the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and any other financial data included or [[Exchange Act]] by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, (C) as of the Applicable Time, the Pricing Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and any other financial data included or [[Exchange Act]] by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief), taken together with the Final Term Sheet and any other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (D) as of the Time of Delivery, none of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and any other financial data included or [[Exchange Act]] by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or (E) any of the documents [[Exchange Act]] by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and any other financial data included or [[Exchange Act]] by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief), when such document or amendment or supplement, as the case may be, was filed with the Commission, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; 

^^At the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a “comfort” letter or letters dated such Time of Delivery as to such matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives; 

^^(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or [[Exchange Act]] by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, which loss or interference would have a material adverse effect on the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders’ equity, results of operations or internal control over financial reporting of the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise and (ii) since the dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders’ equity, results of operations or internal control over financial reporting of the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, otherwise than as set forth in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; 

^^On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company’s debt securities (including, without limitation, any guaranteed debt securities) by any “nationally recognized statistical rating organization,” as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company’s debt securities;

^^The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at, or prior to, such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in Sections 8(a) and 8(e) and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request. 

^Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement to any thereof, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any “issuer information” filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any “road show” (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) that does not otherwise constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; *provided, however,* that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement to any thereof, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter of any Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in any thereof. 

^^Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement to any thereof, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement to any thereof, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use therein, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. 

^^Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 9(a) or Section 9(b) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such Section 9(a) or 9(b), notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such Section 9(a) or 9(b). In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under Section 9(a) or 9(b), as the case may be, for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. 

^^If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 9(a) or Section 9(b) in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 9(c), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statement or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Designated Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this Section 9(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Designated Securities and are not joint. 

^^The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. 

^Defaulting Underwriters. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities that it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein and therein. In the event that, within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term “Underwriter” as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement. 

^^If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 10(a), the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 

^^If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 10(a), the aggregate principal amount or Designated Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in Section 10(b), or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 10(b) to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 

^Survival. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any director or officer or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities with respect to which such indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements are made or given. 

^Termination. If the Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by the Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 7 and Section 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason the Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 7 and Section 9 hereof. 

^Authority of Representatives. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. 

^Nature of Underwriters’ Obligations. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Designated Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement is an arm’s-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it shall not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto. 

^Notices. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Company, shall be delivered or sent by mail, air courier or facsimile transmission (which shall be effective upon confirmation by telephone) to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Chief Executive Officer, with a copy to the General Counsel of the Company; and, if to the Underwriters, shall be delivered or sent by mail, air courier or facsimile transmission (which shall be effective upon confirmation by telephone) to the address or addresses of the Representative or Representatives, as the case may be, as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; *provided, however*, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission (which shall be effective upon confirmation by telephone) to such Underwriter at its address which, if not set forth in the Pricing Agreement, will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon the addressee’s receipt thereof. 

^Persons Entitled to the Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement and the Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 9 and Section 11 hereof, the directors and officers of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective successors and assigns (including, in the case of natural persons, their respective heirs, executors and administrators), and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or the Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 

^Time of Essence. Time shall be of the essence of the Pricing Agreement. As used herein, “business day” shall mean any day when the Commission’s office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. 

^Definitive Agreement. This Agreement and the Pricing Agreement supersede all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
