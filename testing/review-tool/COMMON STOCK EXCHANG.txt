^Representations and Warranties of the Exchanging Member. As of any Exchange Date, the following representations and warranties of the Exchanging Member shall be true and correct: 

^^*Title to Common Stock*. The Exchanging Member possesses good and marketable title to the Common Stock to be exchanged and has full right to transfer the same as contemplated herein. Such shares of Common Stock are delivered free and clear of any and all Liens. 

^^*Purchase for Investment*. The Exchanging Member acknowledges that the Non-Voting Stock has not been registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws. The Exchanging Member (i) is acquiring the Non-Voting Stock pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act solely for investment with no present intention to distribute any of the Non-Voting Stock to any person, (ii) will not sell or otherwise dispose of any of the Non-Voting Stock, except in compliance with the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 4.2 of the Purchase Agreement, and subject to Section 3.6 and Section 4.5 of the Purchase Agreement, and the registration requirements or exemption provisions of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws, (iii) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and in investments of this type that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Non-Voting Stock and of making an informed investment decision and (iv) is an institutional “accredited investor” (as that term is defined in Rule 501 of the Securities Act). 

^^The Exchanging Member agrees and acknowledges that the shares of Non-Voting Stock issuable hereunder will be subject to restrictions on transfer pursuant to applicable securities laws, and that all certificates or other instruments representing the Non-Voting Stock subject to this Agreement or to the Purchase Agreement will bear a legend substantially to the following effect: 

“THE NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS INSTRUMENT HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT WHILE A REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATING THERETO IS IN EFFECT UNDER SUCH ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT OR SUCH LAWS. 

To the extent Section 4.2 of the Purchase Agreement is applicable at the time of any relevant Exchange, such shares will also bear a legend substantially to the following effect: 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSFER AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 8, 2010, COPIES OF WHICH ARE ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE ISSUER.” 

Upon request of the Exchanging Member and receipt by the Company of an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company to the effect that such legend is no longer required under the Securities Act and applicable state laws, the Company shall promptly cause the first provision of the legend to be removed from any certificate for any Non-Voting Stock to be so transferred and, upon the request of the Exchanging Member, the second provision of the legend shall be removed upon the expiration of such transfer and other restrictions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. 

^Representations and Warranties of the Company. As of any Exchange Date, the following representations and warranties of the Company shall be true and correct: 

^^*Title to Non-Voting Stock*. Any shares of Non-Voting Stock to be issued upon exchange in accordance with the provisions of Article II are duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable and issued by the Company free from all taxes, liens and charges. None of the Non-Voting Stock to be issued upon exchange in accordance with the provisions of Article II shall be subject to any outstanding option, warrant, call, or similar right of any other Person to acquire the same, and none of such Non-Voting Stock will be subject to any restriction on transfer thereof except for restrictions imposed by applicable federal and state securities laws, pursuant to any agreement or action taken by the Exchanging Member or by the express terms of the Purchase Agreement. 

^^*Board Approval*. The issuance of shares of Non-Voting Stock to be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of Article II has been approved by the board of directors of the Company or a committee thereof pursuant to a resolution substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (with such changes as may be reasonably requested by the Exchanging Member), which action shall be taken pursuant to the Company’s obligations to cooperate with the Exchanging Member to seek to structure such exchange to exempt it from Section 16 pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or any successor rule). 

\centered **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective with respect to any party unless made in writing and signed by an officer of a duly authorized representative of such party. 

^^Any member of the WP Group that acquires Common Stock may be joined to this Agreement by execution of a joinder in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

^Further Action. The parties shall execute and deliver all documents, provide all information and take or refrain from taking action as may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this Agreement. 

^Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of all of the parties and, to the extent permitted or required by this Agreement, their successors, executors, administrators, heirs, legal representatives and assigns. 

^Captions. The article, section, paragraph and clause captions herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and will not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. 

^Severability.

Upon such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties. 

^Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Purchase Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (b) this Agreement will not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise (any attempted assignment in contravention hereof being null and void).

For the purposes of clarity, the mechanics for the exchange of Non-Voting Stock into Common Stock are described in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company. 

^Waiver. No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute waiver of any such breach of any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition. 

^Counterparts. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Agreement may be executed in any number of separate counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such counterparts will together constitute the same agreement. Executed signature pages to this Agreement may be delivered by facsimile and such facsimiles will be deemed as sufficient as if actual signature pages had been delivered. 

^Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State and without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereby agrees not to commence any such action, suit or proceeding other than before one of the above-named courts. 

^WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND AGREE THAT ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.
