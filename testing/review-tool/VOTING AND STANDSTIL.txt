^^^^^

Section 8.9  Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.2(c), this Agreement may not be assigned by any of the parties hereto by operation of law or otherwise. 

Section 8.10  Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

^Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in a manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.
