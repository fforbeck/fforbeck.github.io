No fractional shares shall be used for such payment and the Administrator shall determine whether cash shall be given in lieu of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares shall be eliminated.

^^Stock Awards. The Administrator may from time to time grant restricted or unrestricted Stock Awards to eligible Participants in such amounts, on such terms and conditions (which terms and conditions may condition the vesting or payment of Stock Awards on the achievement of one or more Performance Goals), and for such consideration, including no consideration or such minimum consideration as may be required by law, as it shall determine. 

^^Phantom Stock. The Administrator may from time to time grant Awards to eligible participants denominated in stock-equivalent units (“Phantom Stock”) in such amounts and on such terms and conditions as it shall determine, which terms and conditions may condition the vesting or payment of Phantom Stock on the achievement of one or more Performance Goals. Phantom Stock units granted to a Participant shall be credited to a bookkeeping reserve account solely for accounting purposes and shall not require a segregation of any of the Corporation’s assets. An Award of phantom stock may be settled in Common Stock, in cash, or in a combination of Common Stock and cash, as specified in the Grant Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Grant Agreement, the grantee shall not have the rights of a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock represented by a phantom stock unit solely as a result of the grant of a phantom stock unit to the grantee. In granting any such Phantom Stock Awards, the Administrator shall consider the potential application of Section 409A of the Code, and the applicable Grant Agreement shall include appropriate disclosure with respect to any such potential application.

In granting any such Awards, the Administrator shall consider the potential application of Section 409A of the Code, and the applicable Grant Agreement shall include appropriate disclosur e with respect to any such potential application.

^Miscellaneous.

^^Investment Representations. The Administrator may require each person acquiring shares of Common Stock pursuant to Awards hereunder to represent to and agree with the Corporation in writing that such person is acquiring the shares without a view to distribution thereof. The certificates for such shares may include any legend that the Administrator deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer. All certificates for shares issued pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to such stock transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed or interdealer quotation system upon which the Common Stock is then quoted, and any applicable federal or state securities laws.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the Corporation to apply for or to obtain such listing, registration or qualification, or to satisfy such condition.

The Corporation or its Affiliate may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the grantee or holder of an Award. In the event that payment to the Corporation or its Affiliate of such tax obligations is made in shares of Common Stock, such shares shall be valued at Fair Market Value on the applicable date for such purposes and shall not exceed in amount the minimum statutory tax withholding obligation.

^^Loans. To the extent otherwise permitted by law, the Corporation or its Affiliate may make loans to grantees to assist grantees in exercising Awards and satisfying any withholding tax obligations.

Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator in accord with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, an Award may be exercised during the lifetime of the grantee, only by the grantee or, during the period the grantee is under a legal disability, by the grantee’s guardian or legal representative.

In the event of any transaction resulting in a Change of Control of the Corporation, (A) outstanding stock options and other Awards that are payable in or convertible into Common Stock under the Plan will terminate upon the effective time of such Change of Control unless provision is made in connection with the transaction for the continuation or assumption of such Awards by, or for the substitution of the equivalent awards of, the surviving or successor entity or a parent thereof; (B) except as provided in the next sentence of this Section 7(f)(ii), all outstanding stock options and other Awards shall vest and become exercisable to the extent provided for in the applicable Grant Agreement, and (C) the holders of stock options and other Awards under the Plan will be permitted, immediately before the Change of Control, to exercise or convert all portions of such stock options or other Awards under t he Plan that are then exercisable or convertible or which become exercisable or convertible upon or prior to the effective time of the Change of Control.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, the Board may not amend or modify the Plan or any portion thereof without stockholder approval where such approval is required by applicable law. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, the Administrator may not amend or modify any Award if such amendment or modification would require the approval of the stockholders if the amendment or modification were made to the Plan.

^^^Non-Guarantee of Employment or Service. Nothing in the Plan or in any Grant Agreement thereunder shall confer any right on an individual to continue in the service of the Corporation or shall interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation to terminate such service at any time with or without cause or notice and whether or not such termination results in (i) the failure of any Award to vest; (ii) the forfeiture of any unvested or vested portion of any Award; and/or (iii) any other adverse effect on the individual’s interests under the Plan.

^^No Trust or Fund Created. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Corporation and a grantee or any other person.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be required to sell or issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any Award if the sale or issuance of such shares would constitute a violation by the individual exercising the Award or the Corporation of any provision of any law or regulation of any governmental authority, including without limitation any federal or state securities laws or regulations, and (ii) the inability of the Corporation to obtain any necessary authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Corporation’s counsel to be necessary to the lawful exercise or payment of any Award h ereunder, shall relieve the Corporation of any liability in respect of the exercise or payment of such Award to the extent such requisite authority shall have been deemed necessary and shall not have been obtained.
