The Mortgagor shall not, nor shall the Mortgagor permit others to take, fail to take, or permit any action which may result in a release of any toxic or hazardous substance, waste or constituent in, on, about or from the Mortgaged Premises to the extent prohibited by the Senior Mortgage. The Mortgagor warrants that the Mortgagor is not subject to any claim for which any local, state or federal law governing liability for any such substance, waste or constituent may apply.

^^**Mortgagee’s Right to Cure**. Subject to the Mortgagor’s rights under Section 1.8 hereof, if the Mortgagor shall fail to comply with any of the covenants or obligations of this Mortgage, then the Mortgagee may, but shall not be obligated to, upon notice to the Mortgagor, but without waiving or releasing the Mortgagor from any obligation contained in this Mortgage, perform such covenants and agreements, investigate and defend against such action or proceeding, and take such other action as the Mortgagee deems reasonably necessary to protect its interest in the Mortgaged Premises or this Mortgage. The Mortgagor agrees to repay upon demand all reasonable sums incurred by the Mortgagee in remedying any such failure, together with interest at the rate of six ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) percent. All such sums, together with interest as aforesaid, shall become so much additional Secured Indebtedness, but no such advance shall be deemed to relieve the Mortgagor from any failure hereunder.

The Mortgagee shall pay all costs of filing such instruments. 

^^**No Consent**. Nothing contained in this Mortgage shall constitute any consent or request by the Mortgagee, express or implied, for the performance of any labor or services or for the furnishing of any materials or other property in respect of the Mortgaged Premises or any part thereof, nor as giving the Mortgagor or any party in interest with the Mortgagor any right, power or authority to contract for or permit the performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any materials or other property in such fashion as would create any personal liability against the Mortgagee in respect thereof (except pursuant to any lease of the Mortgaged Premises), or would permit the making of any claim that any lien based on the performance of such labor or services or the furnishing of any such materials or other property is prior to the lien of this Mortgage. 

^^**Further Assurances**. The Mortgagor shall execute and deliver to the Mortgagee from time to time, such further instruments, security agreements, financing statements under the Uniform Commercial Code and assurances and do such further acts reasonably required to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Mortgage and without limiting the foregoing, to make subject to the lien hereof any property agreed to be subjected hereto or covered by the granting clause hereof, or so intended to be.

No delay or omission by the Mortgagee in the exercise of any right, power or remedy arising hereunder or arising otherwise shall impair any such right, power or remedy or the right of the Mortgagee to resort thereto at a later date or be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default or Default under this Mortgage or the Performance Agreement.

As used herein the words “successors and assigns” shall also be deemed to include the heirs, representatives, administrators and executors of any natural person who is a party to this Mortgage. 

^^**Severability and Survival**. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provisions hereof shall not render any other provision, or provisions herein contained unenforceable or invalid. The foreclosure of this Mortgage will not affect or limit any remedy of the Mortgagee on account of any breach by the Mortgagor of the terms of this Mortgage occurring prior to such foreclosure, except to the extent of the amount bid at foreclosure.
