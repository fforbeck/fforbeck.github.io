Warrant No. W-2      [[Shares 1: Number]] Shares

This certifies that, for the agreed upon value of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] and for other good and valuable consideration, SILICON VALLEY BANK or its permitted registered assigns (either, the “Registered Holder”), is entitled, subject to the terms and conditions of this Warrant, to purchase from PINPOINT.COM, INC., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), at any time after the date of this Warrant and prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below), up to [[Shares 1]] shares (subject to adjustment as hereinafter set forth) of the common stock, $[[USD Value 3: Number]] par value per share (the “Common Stock”), of the Company, at a purchase price of Twenty-Five Cents ($[[USD Value 4: Number]]) per share (as adjusted as hereinafter set forth, the “Purchase Price”), upon the terms and conditions set forth below. 

^Exercise of Warrant. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, this Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part, from time to time, at any time after the date hereof but in any event at or prior to 5:00 P.M., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina time, on the Expiration Date but not thereafter, by surrendering this Warrant at the principal office of the Company together with a duly executed subscription form in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1, together with the payment of the sum obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased by the Purchase Price. In case of any partial exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor for the balance of the shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder. Upon receipt of notice of any of the events specified in Paragraphs 7(b), 7(c) or 7(d) below, the Registered Holder may elect to exercise the Warrant subject to the occurrence of the event described in such notice by delivering to the Company a duly executed subscription form which shall expressly state that such exercise is contingent upon the occurrence of such event and the Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised on the date on which such event actually occurs. 

^Effect of Exercise. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately prior to the close of business on the date of its surrender for exercise as provided above, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of record of such shares as of the close of business on such date. As soon as practicable on or after such date, the Company shall issue and deliver to the person (or persons) entitled to receive the same a certificate or certificates for the number of whole shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share equal to such fraction of the Fair Market Value (as defined in Paragraph 10 below) of one whole share of Common Stock as of the date of exercise. No fractional shares may be issued upon any exercise of this Warrant. All shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. 

^Adjustment of Purchase Price and Number of Shares Purchasable Hereunder. The Purchase Price and the number of shares purchasable hereunder shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with the following provisions: 

^^In case the Company shall at any time subdivide the outstanding shares of its Common Stock, the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately decreased, and in case the Company shall at any time combine the outstanding shares of its Common Stock, the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased, effective from and after the record date of such subdivision or combination, as the case may be. Upon any adjustment in the Purchase Price pursuant to this Paragraph 3(a), the Registered Holder shall thereafter be entitled to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of shares of Common Stock, calculated to the nearest full share, obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder immediately prior to such adjustment by the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment, and dividing the product thereof by the Purchase Price resulting from such adjustment. 

^^In case the Company shall issue additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend on the Common Stock, from and after the day which is the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to such dividend, the Registered Holder shall, until a further adjustment, be entitled to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock, calculated to the nearest full share, obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder immediately prior to said record date by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after the issuance of the dividend, calculated on a fully diluted basis assuming the conversion of all outstanding convertible securities and the exercise of all outstanding options, warrants or other rights (including those with respect to convertible securities), and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to said record date, calculated on a fully diluted basis assuming the conversion of all outstanding convertible securities and the exercise of all outstanding options, warrants, or other rights (including those with respect to convertible securities). Upon each adjustment pursuant to this Paragraph 3(b), the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment shall be reduced to an amount determined by dividing the product obtained by multiplying such Purchase Price by the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder immediately following such adjustment. 

^Reorganization or Reclassification. If at any time while this Warrant is outstanding there shall be any reorganization or reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Paragraph 3), the Registered Holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive, during the term hereof and upon payment of the Purchase Price, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company resulting from such reorganization or reclassification, as the case may be, to which a holder of the Common Stock of the Company, deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant, would have been entitled upon such reorganization or reclassification if this Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such reorganization or reclassification, and in any such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the Registered Holder to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including the adjustment of the Purchase Price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall thereafter be applicable, as near as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares or other property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof. 

^Merger or Consolidation. If at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, the Company shall merge or consolidate with another entity in a transaction in which the Company is not the surviving entity (the “Survivor”) immediately following such merger or consolidation (a “Change of Control Event”): 

^^the Registered Holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive, during the term hereof and upon payment of the Purchase Price, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Survivor to which a holder of the Common Stock of the Company, deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant, would have been entitled upon such Change of Control Event if this Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such Change of Control Event; 

^^the Survivor shall thereafter be liable for and shall assume all obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Warrant; and 

^^the term “Company” shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Survivor and the Survivor shall take such steps in connection with the Change of Control Event as shall be necessary to assure that the provisions of this Warrant shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares or other property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof. 

^Description of Adjustments. After any adjustment of the Purchase Price or the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant or upon the written request of the Registered Holder, the Company shall deliver to the Registered Holder at the address set forth below a written description setting forth in reasonable detail the Purchase Price and number of shares purchasable hereunder as of the date of such notice and the series of calculations leading to such Purchase Price and number of shares. 

^Expiration Date. The stock purchase rights represented by this Warrant shall terminate on the earliest to occur of the following (the “Expiration Date”): 

^^5:00 P.M., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina time, on June , 2010; 

^^the date on which the Company is liquidated or finally dissolved, provided that the Company has given the Registered Holder at least thirty (30) days’ advance written notice of such dissolution or liquidation; 

^^the date on which the Company sells, leases, licenses or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its assets, provided that the Company has given the Registered Holder at least thirty (30) days’ advance written notice of such sale, lease, license or other disposition; or 

^^the closing date of the sale and issuance of shares of Common Stock in a firmly underwritten public offering, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, having gross proceeds to the Company or its stockholders of at least $[[USD Value 1: Number]] (a “Public Offering”), provided that the Company has given the Registered Holder at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of the Company’s intent to engage in a Public Offering and the expected closing date of the Public Offering. 

^Charges, Taxes and Expenses. The issuance of certificates for shares of stock upon any exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Registered Holder for any tax or other expense in respect to the issuance of such certificates, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and, subject to terms and conditions of this Warrant, such certificates shall be issued in the name of, or in such name or names as may be directed by, the Registered Holder; provided, however, that in the event that certificates for shares of stock are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Registered Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by an instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the Registered Holder in person or by an attorney duly authorized in writing and the Registered Holder shall pay all stock transfer taxes payable upon issuance of such stock certificate. 

^Transfer of Warrant. Subject to the terms of this Warrant and compliance with all applicable securities laws, this Warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, on the books of the Company maintained for such purpose at the principal office of the Company by the Registered Holder in person, or by duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of this Warrant properly endorsed and upon payment of any necessary transfer tax or other governmental charge imposed upon such transfer. Each taker and holder of this Warrant, by taking or holding the same, consents and agrees that this Warrant, when endorsed in blank, shall be deemed negotiable and that when this Warrant shall have been so endorsed, the person in possession of this Warrant may be treated by the Company, and all other persons dealing with this Warrant, as the absolute owner hereof for any purpose and as the person entitled to exercise the rights represented hereby, any notice to the contrary notwithstanding; but until a transfer of this Warrant is registered on the books of the Company, the Company may treat the Registered Holder hereof as the owner for all purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Warrant and the rights hereunder may not be transferred unless such transfer complies with all applicable securities laws. Upon any partial transfer, the Company will issue and deliver to the Registered Holder a new Warrant or Warrants with respect to the shares of Common Stock not so transferred. 

^Net Issue Exercise. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of one share of Common Stock is greater than the Purchase Price (at the date of the calculation as set forth below) for that share, in lieu of exercising this Warrant for cash, the Registered Holder of this Warrant may elect to receive shares equal to the value (as determined below) of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being canceled) by surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company (or at such other address as the Company may designate) together with notice of such election. In such event, the Company shall issue to the Registered Holder the number of shares of Common Stock, calculated to the nearest full share, obtained by (X) multiplying (i) the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable under the Warrant or, if only a portion of the Warrant is being exercised, the portion of the Warrant being canceled (at the date of such calculation) by (ii) the difference between the Fair Market Value of one share of the Common Stock (at the date of such calculation) and the per share Purchase Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation), and (Y) dividing the product thereof by the Fair Market Value of one share of the Common Stock. For purposes of this Warrant, the “Fair Market Value” of one share of Common Stock shall be (i) if the Common Stock is then traded on the NASDAQ National Market System or any national securities exchange, the last reported sale price of the Common Stock or the closing price quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System or any national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed, whichever is applicable, as published in *The Wall Street Journal* the trading day prior to the date of exercise, or (ii) if a public market for the Common Stock does not exist at the time of exercise, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date immediately preceding the date of exercise as determined in good faith by the Company’s Board of Directors, or (iii) if the Warrant is exercised in connection with a Public Offering, the initial public offering price of the Common Stock. If the Registered Holder informs the Company in writing that it disagrees with the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with subsection (ii) of the preceding sentence within five business days of the date of such determination, the Company and the Registered Holder shall select a mutually acceptable regional or national investment bank to determine the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date immediately preceding the date of exercise and such determination shall be conclusive. If the fair market value determined by the investment bank is less than or equal to the fair market value determined by the Board of Directors, the cost of the valuation shall be paid by the Registered Holder and if the fair market value determined by the investment bank is greater than the fair market value determined by the Board of Directors, the cost of the valuation shall be paid by the Company. 

^Registration Rights. Upon exercise of this Warrant, the Registered Holder shall have and be entitled to exercise the rights of registration granted under sections 2.2 and 2.3 of that certain Registration Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”), dated as of [[Date 1: Date]], by and among the Company and certain of its stockholders, to Registrable Securities (as that term is defined in the Rights Agreement) with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, provided, however, that such registration rights shall be subordinate to the registration rights granted to holders of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock of the Company and shall be ranked in accordance with the provisions of sections 2.2(c)(iv) and 2.3(c)(iii) of the Rights Agreement. By its receipt of this Warrant, the Registered Holder agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement as modified by the preceding sentence of this Warrant. 

^Information Rights. So long as the Registered Holder holds this Warrant or any shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise hereof, the Company shall deliver to the Registered Holder (a) promptly after mailing, copies of all notices or other written communications to the stockholders of the Company, (b) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, the annual audited financial statements of the Company certified by independent public accountants of recognized standing and (c) such other financial statements required under and in accordance with any loan documents between the Registered Holder and the Company (or if there are no such requirements or if the subject loan(s) no longer are outstanding) then within forty-five (45) days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, the Company’s quarterly, unaudited financial statements. 

^Replacement of Warrant. On receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, on delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company or, in the case of mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company at its expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu of this Warrant, a new Warrant of like tenor and amount. 

^No Impairment. The Company shall not, by any voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Registered Holder against impairment. 

^Notices. In the event that (i) the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or other stock or securities at the time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other right, (ii) the Company shall undertake any capital reorganization, any reclassification of its capital stock, any merger or consolidation which would constitute a Change of Control Event, any sale, lease, license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, or any voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company or (iii) the Company shall consummate a Public Offering, the Company will deliver to the Registered Holder written notice specifying, as the case may be, (a) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and stating the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, (b) the date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, license, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of the Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, license, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, or (c) the anticipated closing date of the Public Offering. Such notice shall be mailed at least thirty (30) days prior to the date specified therein.
