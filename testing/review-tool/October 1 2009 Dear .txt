During the term of this Letter Agreement, you agree to devote your full attention, energies and best efforts to rendering services on behalf of HSW International (or its parent, subsidiaries or other affiliates if directed to do so by the Company). You shall not engage in any outside employment without the express written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding the above, you shall be permitted, to the extent such activities do not substantially interfere with the performance of your duties and responsibilities hereunder to (i) manage your personal, financial and legal affairs, (ii) serve on civic or charitable boar ds or committees (it being expressly understood and agreed that your continuing to serve on any such board and/or committees on which you are serving, or with which you are otherwise associated, as of the Commencement Date, shall be deemed not to interfere with the performance of your duties and responsibilities under this Letter Agreement); and, (iii) investing or trading in stocks, bonds, commodities or other forms of investment, including real property.

^**Term**.  
This term of this Letter Agreement shall begin on the Commencement Date and, unless earlier terminated as provided herein, shall end on the third anniversary of the Commencement Date (the “**Term**”). Thereafter, this Letter Agreement shall terminate, and, unless either party shall elect in writing not to continue your employment with the Company, you shall become an at-will employee of the Company.

^**Compensation and Related Matters**.  
^^**Base Salary**. Your starting salary upon the Commencement Date will be $[[USD Value 1: Number]] per month ($[[USD Value 2: Number]] annually) through [[Date 2: Date]], and then

The Base Salary will be paid to you (minus applicable federal, state and local payroll taxes, and other withholdings required by law or authorized by you) in accordance with HSW International’s normal payroll practices. The Compensation Committee of the Board will review your Base Salary compensation for any discretionary merit-based increases on [[Date 3: Date]], and [[Date 4: Date]].

^^**Bonus Compensation**. In addition to the Base Salary, you will be eligible for an annual discretionary bonus to be determined by the Board based on performance criteria of you and the Company to be discussed with and communicated to you within sixty days by the Compensation Committee of the Board (“**Bonus Plan**”).

All such reimbursements shall be subject to HSW International’s policies and procedures.

Beginning on the Commencement Date, you shall be entitled to participate in other benefit plans to which you are eligible pursuant to Company policy, which may be amended from time to time in the Company’s discretion, and the applicable plan documents (the “**Standard Benefit Plans**”).

^^^Twenty-five thousand shares of the Options shall become immediately vested upon the Commencement date, and 1/36th of the remainder shall become fully vested on each monthly anniversary of the Commencement Date for the Term.

^^**Non-Disclosure of Proprietary Information**. You acknowledge that HSW International’s Proprietary Information will be disclosed to you throughout your employment at the Company in order to enable you to perform your duties for the Company. Finally, you acknowledge that the unauthorized disclosure of Proprietary Information could place the Company at a competitive disadvantage. Consequently, during your employment and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, you agree not to use, publish, disclose or divulge, directly or indirectly, any Proprietary Information except in the performance of your duties to the Company. Yo u further agree not to make un-authorized copies of any Proprietary Information during your employment.

Within forty-eight (48) hours of the termination of your employment for any reason, you will return to the Company any Recipient Materials (inclusive of any copies) that are in your possession, custody or control.

^**Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation of Customers/Clients**.

^^**Access to Proprietary Information**. You acknowledge that the special relationship of trust and confidence between you, HSW International, and its clients and customers creates a high risk and opportunity for the misappropriation of the 

relationship and goodwill existing between HSW International and its clients and customers. You further acknowledge and agree that it is fair and reasonable for HSW International to take steps to protect itself from the risk of such misappropriation. You further acknowledge that, at the outset of your employment with HSW International and/or throughout your employment with the Company, you have been or will be provided with access to and informed of HSW International’s Proprietary Information, which will enable you to benefit from the Company’s goodwill and know-how.

^^**Inevitable Disclosure**. You acknowledge that it would be inevitable in the performance of your duties as a director, officer, employee, investor, agent or executive of any person, association, entity, or company which competes with HSW International to disclose and/or use HSW International’s Proprietary Information, as well as to misappropriate HSW International’s goodwill and know-how, to or for the benefit of such other person, association, entity, or company. You also acknowledge that, in exchange for the execution of the non-solicitation restriction set forth in Section 8(c), you have received substantial, valuable consideration. You further acknowledge and agree that this consideration constitutes fair and adequate consideration for the execution of the non-solicitation restriction set forth in this Section 8.

^^**Covenant Not to Compete**. You agree that during your employment with HSW International and, if terminated, for a period following employment that continues so long as (i) Severance Payment is being made, or (ii) you hold any vested, unexercised Options that have not been terminated (the “**Restrictive Period**”), you shall not, without the prior written consent of the Board, directly or indirectly, on your own behalf or in the service of or on behalf of others, within the Territory, perform the same or substantially the same duties you performed for HSW International, on behalf of any business that competes with HSW International. You and the Company acknowledge that the business of the Company is very broad in scope and that your duties are equally broad in scope because you are the CTO with overall technology responsibility for the entire business. Consequently, “**Territory**” means the United States of America, China and Brazil. The Restrictive Period shall not apply during any time following termination of your employment when no Severance Payment is being made and none of the Options have an exercise price higher than the volume weighted average price of the Company’s common stock over the five most recent trading days.

^^**Non-Solicitation of Customers**. Ancillary to the enforceable promises set forth in this Letter Agreement as well as to protect the vital interests described in this Letter Agreement, you agree that, while you are employed by HSW International and during the Restrictive Period, you will not, without the prior written consent of HSW

International, directly or indirectly, solicit any customer for the purpose of providing products or services that compete with products and services provided by the HSW International. This restriction is limited to customers with whom you had material contact during your employment for the purpose of performing your job duties at the Company. You also agree that, while you are employed by HSW International and for twelve months thereafter, you will not, without the prior written consent of HSW International, directly or indirectly, solicit any business partner of HSW International for the purpose of enticing that business partner to alter, limit or terminate its relationship with HSW International. This restriction is limited to business partners with whom you had material contact during your employment for the purpose of performing your job duties at the Company.

^^**Reasonable Restrictions**. You agree that the restrictions set forth above are ancillary to an otherwise enforceable agreement, are supported by independent valuable consideration, and that the limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained by this Section 8 are reasonable and acceptable, and do not impose any greater restraint than is reasonably necessary to protect the goodwill and other business interests of HSW International. You agree that if, at some later date, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the non-competition and/or the non-solicitation provisions set forth in this Section 8 do not me et the criteria set forth in applicable law, this Section 8 may be reformed by the court and enforced to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law.

^^**Breach**. If you are found to have violated any of the provisions of this Section 8, you agree that the restrictive period of each covenant so violated shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation by him. You understand that your obligations under this Section 8 shall survive the termination of your employment with the Company and shall not be assignable by you.

^**Non-Solicitation of Employees and Executives**.

You acknowledge that, as part of your employment or association with HSW International, you will become familiar with the salary, pay scale, capabilities, experiences, skill and desires of the Company’s employees. In order to protect the confidentiality of such information, as well as HSW International’s investment in and relationships with such employees, you agree that, for a period of 12 months following the termination of your employment with HSW International, whether such termination occurs at the insistence of you or the Company, you shall not directly or indirectly recruit or solicit employees of HSW International with whom you had contact for the purpose of performing your job duties. This restriction is limited to recruiting or soliciting for the purpose of enticing the employee to end his or h er relationship with HSW International. Your obligations under this Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Letter Agreement and your employment with HSW International.

^**Remedies**.  
You hereby acknowledge and agree that in the event that you violate any of the provisions set forth in Sections 6, 7, 8, or 9 of this Letter Agreement, HSW International will suffer immediate and irreparable harm which cannot be accurately calculated in monetary damages. Consequently, you acknowledge and agree that the Company shall – without limitation to or waiver of any other relief available to the Company – be entitled 

to immediate injunctive relief, either by temporary or permanent injunction, to prevent such a violation.

^**Notification of Prospective Employment**.

Prior to accepting employment or an association with any third party which is engaged in a business competitive to the business conducted by HSW International or which, because of the nature of your proposed or potential position with the third party, may require you to use or disclose the Company’s Proprietary Information, you agree to notify such third party that you are bound by the terms of this Letter Agreement. You also agree that the Company may, at any time while any of the non-disclosure or non-solicitation covenants contained in this Letter Agreement are in force, provide notice of the existence of this Letter Agreement to any third party with whom or which you propose to negotiate or are negotiating concerning employment or an association or to accept employment, or with whom or which you have accepted employm ent or an association, without any liability to you for any such notice.

^**Inventions, Ideas/Patentable Inventions**.

You agree to disclose, fully and promptly, and only to HSW International, all ideas, methods, plans, improvements or patentable inventions of any kind which are made or discovered, in whole or in part, by you during the performance of your job duties; that result from any aid, support, or assistance by HSW International; or that are created during your work time with HSW International.

In the event the Company is unable for any reason, after reasonable effort, to secure your signature on any document needed in connection with the actions specified in the preceding paragraph, you hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as your agent and attorney in fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to act for and in your behalf to execute, verify and file any such documents and to do all other lawf ully permitted acts to further the purposes of the preceding paragraph with the same legal force and effect as if executed by you. You hereby waive and quitclaim to the Company any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, which you now or may hereafter have for infringement of any invention, discovery, concept or idea assigned hereunder to the Company.
