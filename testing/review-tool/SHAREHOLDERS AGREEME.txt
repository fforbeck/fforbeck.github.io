To the extent any RFO Offeree does not wish to purchase (or cause its wholly-owned Affiliate(s) to purchase) all of its *pro rata* portion of RFO Ordinary Shares, all of such remaining RFO Ordinary Shares (the “Remaining RFO Ordinary Shares”) shall immediately be re-offered by the RFO Offeror to the other RFO Offeree(s) (or if there is more than one other RFO Offeree, in the proportion (as nearly as may be) to the number of Ordinary Shares held by them inter se), and such other RFO Offeree(s) may accept by delivery to the RFO Offeror of an RFO Exercise in respect of the relevant Remaining RFO Ordinary Shares within 10 (ten) Business Days of such re-offer, after which time such re-offer shall lapse and the re-offer for such Remaining RFO Ordinary Shares will be deemed to have been declined. 

^^If the RFO Offeree(s) shall have delivered an RFO Exercise to the RFO Offeror within the RFO Response Period for all the RFO Ordinary Shares, the RFO Offeror and RFO Offeree(s) shall be respectively bound, and shall complete the sale and purchase of the RFO Ordinary Shares within thirty (30) days thereafter upon the terms set forth in the RFO Notice; provided, however*,* that such period shall be extended following such date as necessary to permit all required approvals, consents or authorizations from, or filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority in connection with such purchase to be obtained or made, to the extent prior to the expiration of the RFO Purchase Period reasonably appropriate actions have been taken by the RFO Offeree(s) to obtain such approvals, consents or authorizations, or make such filings or registrations; and provided further that no such extension shall exceed 60 days. 

^^If the RFO Offeree(s) shall not have completed the purchase of all of the RFO Ordinary Shares within the RFO Purchase Period, as extended as provided in Section 3.3(d), or together have failed to deliver RFO Exercises within the RFO Response Period for all of the RFO Ordinary Shares as contemplated in Section 3.3(d) or declined in writing to exercise the Right of First Offer, then the RFO Offeror shall have the right for sixty (60) days thereafter (the “Transfer Period”), to dispose of the RFO Ordinary Shares in one or more Transfers thereof without being subject to any of the restrictions set forth in this Article III; provided, however, that (i) such Transfer of the RFO Ordinary Shares is consummated on terms not more favorable to the purchasers thereof than the terms specified in the RFO Notice and (ii) the RFO Offeror provides written confirmation to the RFO Offeree(s) that such terms comply with clause (i) hereof prior to the consummation of such sale; and provided further, that the Transfer Period 

^^^^^ 
shall be extended following such date as necessary to permit all required approvals, consents or authorizations from, or filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority in connection with such Transfers to be obtained or made, to the extent prior to the expiration of the Transfer Period reasonably appropriate actions have been taken by the RFO Offeror to obtain such approvals, consents or authorizations or make such filings or registrations; and provided further that no such extension shall exceed thirty (30) days. If at the end of the Transfer Period, as extended as provided herein, the RFO Offeror has not completed the Transfer of the RFO Ordinary Shares, the RFO Offeror shall no longer be permitted to dispose of such RFO Ordinary Shares without again fully complying with the provisions of this Section 3.3. 

^^The RFO Offeror shall, upon the Transfer of the RFO Ordinary Shares, procure the resignation of such number of directors nominated by it, if any, as would be required pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof, and such director shall execute a letter of resignation.

**GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION**  

^^Governing Law. This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of New York (without regard to its conflicts of laws rules that would mandate the application of the laws of another jurisdiction). 

^^Arbitration.

^^Judgment upon any award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction over a party or any of its assets.

**MISCELLANEOUS**  

^^Enforcement on Behalf of the Company. The directors of the Company shall be authorized to enforce the terms of this Agreement on behalf of the Company (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not in any way limit the rights of the Shareholders to enforce their rights under this Agreement directly). 

^^^^^ 
^^Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written instrument duly executed by all the Parties hereto. In the event of an amendment, modification or supplement of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, each Shareholder hereby agrees to vote the Ordinary Shares owned or held by such Shareholder to approve any necessary amendments to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries required to make the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company and its Subsidiaries consistent with this Agreement. 

^^Inspection. For so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, this Agreement shall be made available for inspection by any Shareholder that is a Party hereto at the registered office of the Company. 

^^Waiver. Any Party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of another Party, (b) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the another Party or conditions to such party’s obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any agreement or obligation granted pursuant to this Section 8.4 or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of such agreement or obligation or any other agreement or obligation. The failure of any Party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights. 

^^Assignment. No Party may assign (by operation of law or otherwise) this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other Parties, except that (i) assignments of all of a Shareholder’s rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to its Affiliate in a Permitted Transfer pursuant to Section 3.2(a) shall be permitted so that the E-House Group Shareholders (as a group) and the SINA Group Shareholder(s) (as a group) shall respectively have the same rights and obligations as E-House and SINA, respectively, hereunder; (ii) any SINA Group Shareholder may assign, pursuant to a Permitted Transfer pursuant to Section 3.2, all of its rights, interests and obligations to any non-Affiliate Transferee of Ordinary Shares from it (including the rights, interests and obligations specified in Sections 3.3), provided however that (A) such non-Affiliate Transferee shall not have the rights, interests and obligations specified in Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 and (iii) any E-House Group Shareholder may assign all of its rights, interests and obligations to any non-Affiliate Transferee of Ordinary Shares from it (including the rights, interests and obligations specified in Sections 3.3), provided however that such non-Affiliate Transferee shall not have the rights, interests and obligations specified in Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns. 

^^Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other 

^^^^^ 
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

^^Remedies. In the event of a breach by any Party to this Agreement of its obligations under this Agreement, any Party injured by such breach, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by Law, including recovery of damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Parties agree that the provisions of this Agreement shall be specifically enforceable, it being agreed by the parties that the remedy at law, including monetary damages, for breach of any such provision will be inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is waived. 

^^Headings. The headings used in this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the provisions hereof. 

^^Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given, made or received (i) on the date of delivery if delivered in person or by messenger service, (ii) on the date of confirmation of receipt of transmission by facsimile (or, the first (1st) Business Day following such receipt if (a) such date of confirmation is not a Business Day or (b) confirmation of receipt is given after 5:00 p.m., Beijing time) or (iii) on the date of confirmation of receipt if delivered by an internationally recognized overnight courier service or registered or certified mail (or, the first (1st) Business Day following such receipt if (a) such date of confirmation is not a Business Day or (b) confirmation of receipt is given after 5:00 p.m., Beijing time) to the respective parties hereto at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified in a notice given in accordance with this Section 8.9):
