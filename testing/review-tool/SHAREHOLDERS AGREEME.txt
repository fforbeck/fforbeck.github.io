^^Disposals of Shares as well as creation of any liens or encumbrances not in compliance with the provision of this Section Four shall not be valid or effective, and IUPAR shall be required not to record them in its corporate books.

^^The parties acknowledge that any legal business resulting in disposal or transfer of control or in any change in the composition of the control block of IUPAR, ITAÚ UNIBANCO, ITAÚ, UNIBANCO or any of their financial controlled companies shall depend, pursuant to the applicable legislation or regulations, on approval by the Central Bank of Brazil – BACEN.

^^In the cases provided for in Section 4.17 above and in any other case that may be deemed to be a modification of the composition of the control block of IUPAR, ITAÚ UNIBANCO, ITAÚ, UNIBANCO or any other financial companies controlled thereby which depends, pursuant to the applicable legislation and regulations, on approval by the BACEN, the former members of the control block shall continue to be jointly responsible for the exercise of the control power, as provided for by the applicable legislation, until BACEN approves the composition of the new control block.

Should ITAÚSA dispose of the Direct Shares to companies fully held by it or to any of the members of VILLELA FAMILY, SETUBAL FAMILY, or companies or entities fully held, whether directly or indirectly, by any member of VILLELA FAMILY or SETUBAL FAMILY, then the buyer shall be required to previously adhere to this Agreement.

5.1.2. Should the Direct Shares be disposed of to any third parties that are not members of VILLELA FAMILY and SETUBAL FAMILY, then the buyer may not enter into this Agreement, and therefore the tag along right as provided for in Section 5.2 below or any other right or obligation set forth in this Agreement shall not be applicable thereto.

^^In the event that ITAÚSA and [[FRMS]] FAMILY decide to directly or indirectly dispose of the total Shares or the total shares issued by ITAÚ UNIBANCO and held by IUPAR to any third parties, then ITAÚSA shall have the right to demand that up to the total Direct Shares be also purchase according to the same terms and conditions negotiated by ITAÚSA and by [[FRMS]] FAMILY with the third party buyer.

5.2.1. In the event that ITAÚSA exercises the right discussed in Section 5.2 above, then the third party buyer may only purchase, directly or indirectly, the Shares held by ITAÚSA itself and by the members of [[FRMS]] FAMILY or the shares issued by ITAÚ UNIBANCO and held by IUPAR, as the case may be, if the third party buyer also purchases, on the same terms and conditions, the Direct Shares that ITAÚSA decides to dispose of.

5.2.2. ITAÚSA shall have the non-extendable term of thirty (30) days as of the date on which ITAÚSA and [[FRMS]] FAMILY decide to directly or indirectly sell the Shares or the shares issued by ITAÚ UNIBANCO and held by IUPAR to voice its intention to exercise the right of disposal of Direct Shares together with the total Shares issued by IUPAR or by ITAÚ UNIBANCO, and once said term has elapsed, ITAÚSA shall be deemed to have waived the right set forth in this Section 5.2. ITAÚSA’s intention to exercise the tag along right shall be voiced as provided for in Section 8.11 below.

^^The rules, rights and obligations provided for in this Section Five for ITAÚSA apply identically to any member of [[FRMS]] FAMILY, VILLELA FAMILY and SETUBAL FAMILY in the event that they may hold, whether directly or indirectly, at any time and due to any reason whatsoever, in addition to the equity interest at IUPAR, common shares issued by ITAÚ UNIBANCO.

^^This Agreement shall come into effect and shall remain in effect for the term of twenty (20) years, and the Parties shall not terminate it or fail to comply with it unilaterally. Said term shall be automatically extended for new and successive terms of ten (10) years, except upon written notice to the contrary by ITAÚSA or [[FRMS]] FAMILY given as provided for in Section 8.11 and at least one (1) year in advance as of the end of each term of effectiveness.

SETTLEMENT OF CONTROVERSIES  
^^ITAÚSA and [[FRMS]] FAMILY undertake to settle, in a harmonic manner, by means of amicable negotiation, any controversy, dispute, divergence, litigation or demand (“Dispute”) which may arise between the Parties in relation to this Agreement, whether directly or indirectly, always taking into account the strict interest of IUPAR and ITAÚ UNIBANCO, as well as the principles of mutual cooperation, loyalty, good faith and faithfulness that shall govern the relationship among the Parties.

^^Once a Dispute is characterized, by means of a Dispute notice (“Dispute Notice”) sent by one Party to the other pursuant to Section 8.11 above, the Parties shall, within sixty (60) days as of the receipt of said Dispute Notice, hold meetings for the purpose of negotiating a consensual resolution designed to bring any such Dispute to an end.

^^If no consensual resolution is reached by the time that the term set forth in Section 9.2 elapses, then a mediation proceeding (“Mediation Proceeding”) shall be started immediately, without the need of notice from one Party to the other. Each of the Parties shall indicate, within thirty (30) days as of the beginning of the Mediation Proceeding, an external consultant who is an expert in the matter which is the subject-matter of the Dispute to aid in the attempt to reach a consensual resolution. The external consultants appointed by the Parties may request or contract the performance of internal or external analyses that they may think fit in order to help them reaching the consensual resolution. Likewise, they may hold as many meetings as may be needed, with or without representatives of the Parties, in order to reach a consensual resolution for the Dispute.

^^Once the term of one hundred and twenty (120) days has elapsed since the beginning of the Mediation Proceeding, the external consultants shall mandatorily propose to the Parties a solution for the Dispute by means of a notice sent pursuant to Section 8.11. Then the Parties shall have fifteen (15) days to settle the Dispute.

^^If a consensual resolution cannot be reached by the time the term set forth in Section 9.4 or 9.4.1 above, as the case may be, elapses, then the dispute shall be finally settled by means of arbitration (“Arbitration”) as provided for by Law No. 9307/1996, case in which either Party may request the implementation of the arbitration proceeding.

The arbitrators appointed by ITAÚSA and by [[FRMS]] FAMILY shall jointly choose, within thirty (30) days as of the appointment of the second arbitrator, a third arbitrator, who shall act as the president of the Arbitration Tribunal. Should ITAÚSA or [[FRMS]] FAMILY fail to appoint an arbitrator and/or a deputy arbitrator, then the President of the Chamber shall be in charge of any such appointment. Likewise, should the appointed arbitrators fail to reach an agreement in relation to the appointment of the third arbitrator, the President of the Chamber shall do so.

^^The official language of the Arbitration shall be the Portuguese language, the applicable law shall be the Brazilian law, and the arbitrators shall be barred from deciding based on equity. The Arbitration shall be subject to strict confidentiality by the Parties and the arbitrators.

^^Once the Arbitration Tribunal is implemented, it shall be incumbent upon it to settle all issues arising out of or related to the subject-matter of the claim, including those of an incidental, provisional or coercitive nature.

^^Notwithstanding the provisions above, each Party shall continue to be entitled to resort to the Judiciary to petition for granting of a preliminary injunction or a provisional remedy as required for the sole use by the Arbitration.

9.11.1. Any court orders granted pursuant to Section 9.11, before or after the beginning of the Arbitration, shall not be deemed to be incompatible with the provisions of Section Nine, nor shall they imply waiver of the arbitration tribunal.

9.11.2. For the purposes of this Section 9.11, the parties elect the courts of the City of São Paulo, State of São Paulo and waive any other courts, however privileged they may be.

^^In addition to the authority vested thereupon by the rules of the Chamber, the arbitration tribunal shall have the authority to request preliminary injunctions or provisional remedies whenever it may think fit and fair.

^^The arbitration award shall be handed down in writing, including the grounds therefor, and shall be finally binding upon the parties and enforceable pursuant to its terms.
