^^Fee for Postponement/Cancellation.

6.5.1. Customer and BVL wish to fairly and equitably allocate risk of loss in the event that a scheduled Manufacturing does not occur due to Customer’s request to cancel and/or postpone any Batch. Accordingly, as a policy consideration, BVL and Customer agree to certain fees as set forth below based upon the length of prior notice that Customer is able to provide BVL. Such prior written notice determines BVL’s likelihood of being able to fill the capacity reserved by Customer and to reduce the likelihood of BVL’s loss due to Customer’s cancellation. In the event that

Customer cancels or gives notice of its intent to postpone a scheduled Manufacturing of a Batch of Product, then the following fees shall apply:

6.5.1.1. Notice of ** (**) days or less: As the equipment, preparations and materials associated with the Batch have been allocated and prepared and can no longer be re-used, Customer shall pay ****% of the Purchase Order price.

6.5.1.2. Notice of ** (****) to **** (****) Days: If notice of such postponement/cancellation is delivered not less than **** days and not more than ** days from the scheduled Manufacturing Date, Customer shall pay ****% of the Purchase Order price.

6.5.1.3. Notice greater than ** (****) Days: As BVL may have the opportunity to avoid certain costs associated with the Manufacturing of the Batch pursuant to the Purchase Order but may not be able to mitigate its losses by utilizing the Manufacturing suites allocated pursuant to Customer’s Purchase Order, Customer and BVL agree to allocate and share the potential risk and BVL may charge, in its discretion, an administrative fee to cover the cost of rescheduling Manufacturing. In no event shall such administrative fee exceed ** dollars ($****).

6.5.2. BVL will use commercially reasonable efforts to use the capacity created by any postponement or cancellation under this Paragraph 6.5 to manufacture product for its other customers, including Bedford Laboratories. To the extent the capacity is able to be used then fees as applied in Paragraphs 6.5.1.1 and 6.5.1.2 will be reduced commensurately.

6.5.3. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice for a cancellation/postponement fee, Customer shall be entitled to request an audit (through Agents) at a mutually agreed upon timeframe, of the Equipment and BVL’s books and records regarding the use of such Equipment following any cancellation/postponement, the use of the operating capacity of any applicable Facility at the time of a postponement/cancellation, and the calculation of any and all personnel and associated expenses incurred by BVL and charged to Customer. Any such audit shall be conducted by a mutually agreed third-party auditor, and the costs of any such audit shall be born by Customer.

BVL hereby holds harmless and indemnifies Customer, its Affiliates and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents the “Customer Indemnitees”) against any and all Losses incurred by any Customer Indemnitee in preparing, or defending against any Claims based on, resulting from, arising out of or in connection with any actual or alleged: (a) personal injuries and/or death that are proximately caused (as defined under Delaware law) by a Manufacturing Defect (as hereinafter defined); (b) breach by BVL of its representations, warranties or covenants hereunder, including personal injuries and/or death claims; (c) any recall pursuant to Article 25 of this Agreement due to BVL’s negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of any covenant, representation or warranty in this Agreement; or (d) negligent act of the willful misconduct of any BVL Indemnitees in performing BVL’s obligations under this Agreement except, in each case, to the comparative extent such Claim arose out of or resulted from a matter for which Customer is responsible therefor pursuant to Section 8.1. For the purposes of this Section 8.2, “Manufacturing Defect” means the negligence, recklessness (having a baseline not less than negligence), wrongful intentional acts or negligent omissions, or strict liability of or by BVL or its Affiliates or its Agents resulting from, or arising out of or in connection with the Manufacture of a Product by BVL.

^^Indemnification Procedures. Any BVL Indemnitees or Customer Indemnitees (collectively, “Indemnitees”) seeking indemnification under Section 8.1 or 8.2 agrees to notify the indemnifying Party within ten (10) business days of receipt of any Claims demands or threats of suit for which such Party may be liable under Section 8.1 or 8.2 as the case may be; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification to be provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnitee(s) failed to give such notice). The indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend, to employ counsel of its choosing, to control, to negotiate, and to settle such claims; provided, however, that the indemnitee(s) shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such matter and to employ counsel at its expense to assist therein. The Indemnitee(s) shall provide the indemnifying Party with such information and assistance as the indemnifying Party may reasonably request, at the expense of the indemnifying Party. The Parties understand that no insurance deductible shall be credited against losses for which a Party is responsible under this Article 8. No indemnifying Party under Section 8.1 or 8.2 may compromise or settle any Claim or pay any settlement amount in the connection with the compromise or settlement of any Claim without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, such written consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

^^Insurance. Customer and BVL will each, at its own cost and expense, obtain and maintain in full force and effect, during the term of this Agreement and for a period of one year following the expiration or other termination of this Agreement, Commercial General Liability insurance, written on the standard approved Policy Form, and Blanket Contractual Liability, with limits of liability of not less than $**** Combined Single Limit Bodily Injury and Property Damage covering its duties and obligations under the Agreement. Furthermore, during the term of this Agreement, BVL shall obtain and maintain “All Risk” property insurance valued at replacement cost, covering loss or damage to the Facility and Customer’s property and materials in the care, custody, and control of BVL including, for the avoidance of doubt all API and Customer-supplied Composition. The coverage limits may be provided through a combination of Primary, Excess/Umbrella or Self-Insured Retention. The Parties further understand and agree that the insurance limits identified herein shall not act as a bar to any recovery.

^^Specific Limitation of Liability for Process-Related (i.e., during Manufacturing) Losses.

8.5.1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any collateral documents hereunder (invoices, purchase orders, etc.), the Parties acknowledge and agree that BVL’s sole liability to Customer for in-process Manufacturing losses (i.e. loss of API, or Customer-supplied Composition) is set forth exclusively in this section 8.5. Except for Batches of *Definity* (where the maximum liability shall be $**), BVL agrees to reimburse Customer up to a maximum of $**** per Batch pro-rated over the usable portion of the Batch, if applicable, for any loss of API or Customer-supplied Composition for each Batch that does not meet. Specification or was not Manufactured in accordance with the Manufacturing Process or cGMP and therefore can not be released; provided that the loss of such materials can be shown after investigation to be caused solely and directly by: (a) the failure of BVL to follow its SOP’s; or (b) BVL’s negligence, willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement; or (c) BVL’s willful misconduct, where, solely for purposes of this Section 8.5.1, such “willful misconduct” shall have the meaning set forth under Delaware law. In the absence of a showing of (a), (b) or (c), above, then BVL shall have no liability to Customer for such Batch of Product. In addition to this payment, BVL will be responsible for all Manufacturing fees incurred during the Manufacture of the failed Batch, pro-rated over the usable portion of the Batch, if applicable. The maximum amounts set forth in Section 8.5.1 shall increase annually by the percentage increase of the actual cost of the API and Customer-supplied Composition or as in the case of Definity the percentage increase as applied to the $**** maximum as described above as shown by Customer’s written records. The monetary values of all Customer-supplied Composition and API must be disclosed by Customer to BVL in writing prior to production in the questionnaire provided by BVL to Customer. The Customer is responsible for notifying BVL in writing of any changes in the value of the Customer-supplied Composition and API supplied to BVL, and BVL shall not be liable for any increase in the cost of the foregoing if Customer fails to provided the abovementioned notice or timely updates thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any declared value of API costs in excess of $**** or $**** as applicable, or the insurance levels identified in Section 8.4 or elsewhere, in no event shall BVL’s liability to Customer for in-process loss of API or Customer-supplied Composition be in excess of $** or $****, as applicable, per Batch except to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

^^LIABILITY LIMITATION.

8.6.1. **ELECTION OF REMEDIES**. SECTION 3.9.4, 3.9.5, 8.2, 8.5 AND 25.1 ARE CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY PRODUCT THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THE MASTER BATCH RECORD AND/OR WERE NOT MANUFACTURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.

8.6.2. **SPECIAL DAMAGES**. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST MARKET SHARE OR DAMAGES STEMMING FROM AN INTERRUPTION OF SUPPLY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (THE “SPECIAL DAMAGES”).

8.6.3. **BVL CAP ON LIABILITY**. THE PARTIES RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS ARTICLE 8 ATTEMPTS TO EQUITABLY ALLOCATE RISK WITH RESPECT TO EACH PARTIES’ RESPECTIVE INTEREST IN THE AGREEMENT AND THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN ARE COMPROMISES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET FORTH HEREIN, BVL’S TOTAL MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED **** DOLLARS ($****) FOR THE INITIAL TERM OF THE AGREEMENT.

8.6.4. **INTEGRAL PROVISIONS.** THESE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8.6 SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY, SUCH LIMITED WARRANTIES, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND SPECIAL PROVISIONS ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Receiving Party shall permit the Disclosing Party the opportunity, if desired, to seek an appropriate protective order or other confidential treatment or remedy with respect to narrowing the scope of such use or disclosure. Upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all copies of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party.

^^Publicity. Neither Party will issue any press release or other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, except where such announcements are required by Applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange or NASDAQ provided, however, that prior to any announcement in accordance with Applicable Law or rules, the disclosing Party shall provide written notice of such potential announcement to the other Party, and cooperate with the other Party’s requests and lawful decision to avoid or minimize the degree of such disclosure. Such other Party shall permit the disclosing Party the opportunity, if desired, to seek an appropriate protactive order or other confidential treatment or remedy with respect to narrowing the scope of such announcement. Product labeling (primary, secondary, and any insert) and government filings may indicate that Product has been Manufactured for Customer by BVL.

^^Customer’s Agents. In the event that Customer desires for its Agents to perform an audit at the Facility and/or otherwise enter upon the Facility, then prior to any such visit, such Agent shall either be required to enter into an agreement with BVL in which it agrees to comply with the confidentiality obligations, restrictions and responsibilities imposed upon Customer in this Section. In BVL’s discretion, such agreement shall be acknowledged by Customer denoting that the individual identified thereon is Customer’s Agent.

^^Non-Disclosure of Customer’s Confidential Information to Third Parties or Bedford Laboratories. The Parties acknowledge that the actual Manufacturing Process may be performed by employees that perform routine and normal manufacturing services (e.g., in filling, packaging, sterile rooms, shipping, etc.) and who also perform similar services for BVL’s other third-party customers and for Bedford Laboratories. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BVL agrees that it shall not disclose Customer’s Confidential Information or Customer Technology to any Third Party or Affiliate of BVL, including any personnel of Bedford (except for those manufacturing employees referenced in the preceding sentence that require the use of such Customer Confidential Information or Customer Technology in order to Manufacture Product).

^^Notice to Senior Scientists and Manufacturing Personnel who Separate Employment with BVL. For senior members of BVL’s Product and Process Development (PPD) Department and Manufacturing Department who separate employment from BVL, BVL shall, when it determines appropriate in its sole discretion, send a copy of such individual’s “Invention & Secrecy Agreement” agreement to both the individual and his/her new company (if known).

For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that BVL incorporates BVL Technology into the Product, the foregoing grant shall be for the benefit of Customer and solely for the benefit of the Product, and shall not be utilized for any other product, whether by Customer or any of Customer’s Agents.

^^Customer Improvements.

11.3.1. Customer shall own all right, title and interest in and to all inventions, discoveries, developments, improvements, new uses, processes, know-how, compounds, compositions, or syntheses that are conceived, reduced to practice or first demonstrated to have utility in the course of activities under this Agreement or the 1993 Agreement and that are Product-specific or are specific to the use of the API for use in the same therapeutic class, including but not limited to any process for making any Product, any use of any Product, any method of analyzing or characterizing any Product or any Product formulation, and any analysis or characterization of any Product or any Product formulation (collectively, “Customer Inventions”). As used in this Agreement, “Product-specific” shall mean relating to the Products, any intermediates or derivatives thereof, and the Manufacturing thereof but not routine manufacturing processes which are not specific to the Manufacturing of Product.

^^BVL Improvements.

11.4.1. BVL shall own all right, title and interest in and to all inventions, discoveries, developments, improvements, new uses, processes, know-how, compounds, compositions, or syntheses that are conceived, reduced to practice or first demonstrated to have utility in the course of activities under this Agreement or the 1993 Agreement and that are conceived, reduced to practice or first demonstrated to have utility in the course of activities under this Agreement or the 1993 Agreement and that relate to BVL’s Technology, BVL Confidential Information or BVL Improvements but are not Product-specific (collectively, “BVL Inventions”). For the avoidance of doubt, where an invention relates to both the BVL’s technology, equipment or equipment processes and to a Product or a Product formulation (e.g., a complex between a Product and a proprietary complexing agent of BVL), such invention to the extent it is “Product-specific” shall be a Customer Invention.

11.4.2. Ownership of any Invention which is not a Customer Invention or a BVL. Invention (“Other Invention”) shall be as follows: (x) where such Other Invention is jointly conceived, reduced to practice or first demonstrated to have utility under this Agreement or the 1993 Agreement by: (i) one or more employees, consultants or Agents of a Party or an Affiliate of such Party; and (ii) one or more employees, consultants or Agents of the other Party or an Affiliate of such other Party, such Other Invention shall be jointly owned by the Parties, and (y) where such Other Invention is conceived, reduced to practice or first demonstrated to have utility solely by an employee, consultant or Agent of a Party or an Affiliate of that Party, such Offer Invention shall be owned by such Party.

11.4.3. The inventorship of all Inventions conceived, reduced to practice or first demonstrated to have utility in the course of activities under this Agreement will be determined in accordance with United States laws for inventorship. Each party hereby agrees to disclose to the other Party promptly and in writing all Inventions conceived or reduced to practice or first demonstrated to have utility in the course of activities under this Agreement by an employee, consultant or Agent of a Party or its Agents. BVL hereby assigns to Customer all right, title and interest of BVL in or to any Customer Inventions. Customer hereby assigns to BVL all right, title and interest of Customer in or to any BVL Inventions. Each Party shall cooperate (and cause its Agents and all employees to cooperate) with the other Party in taking all steps and actions (including but not limited to maintaining in confidence any Inventions that constitute trade-secrets, and executing appropriate documentation in connection with the filing of any patent application(s) on any Invention of the other Party) which such Party believes reasonably necessary or desirable to apply for and/or maintain intellectual property protection for the benefit of Customer or BVL as the case may be in any country, or to perfect or enforce such Party’s ownership and right in the Inventions; provided, however, that the costs and expenses for taking such steps and actions are borne by the Party seeking to obtain IP registration or protection.

^^Term. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be in effect for an initial term of five (5) Contract Years (the “Initial Term”). After the initial term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive five (5) Contract Year periods unless terminated by Customer or BVL upon twenty-four months written notice.

12.1.1. Renewal of the Funds for Indemnity Obligation. The total aggregate cap of liability of ** Dollars ($****) for the Initial Term set forth in Section 8.6 of this Agreement shall renew for each successive **** (****) year term of the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no carry-over of indemnity shall be permitted from term-to-term, meaning that no part of the prior term’s indemnity funds shall be available in a successive term. Likewise, for the further avoidance of doubt, an indemnity obligation that is triggered in one term (for instance, during the Initial Term) shall be limited to the indemnity cap available in such term and, notwithstanding any renewal of the Agreement, may not draw from the ** Dollars ($****) that becomes available from the subsequent, renewal term.

^^Termination by Either Party Without Cause. Either Party may terminate this Agreement without cause by providing twenty-four (24) months written notice to the other

Party. Notwithstanding such no fault termination, Customer shall be liable for any outstanding Development Services performed or Purchase Orders filled by BVL as of the date of termination. For the avoidance of doubt either Party may terminate with respect to any individual Product which termination shall not effect the viability of the Agreement with respect to any remaining Products. Upon notice of termination by BVL under this Section 12.2 and at the written request of Customer, BVL will continue to Manufacture Products in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and pursuant to and up to the quantities enumerated in the first two years of the then-current Rolling Five-Year Forecast in existence as of the date of termination plus a mutually agreed-upon terminal quantity.

^^Termination for Breach. Either Party may terminate this Agreement for a material breach or default by the other Party by giving the breaching Party written notice, specifying the breach or default, and giving the breaching Party thirty (30) days to cure such breach or default. For the avoidance of doubt either Party may terminate with respect to any individual Product which termination shall not effect the viability of the Agreement with respect to any remaining Products. If the breach or default has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice the Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled, without prejudice, to terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that if such breach or default reasonably cannot be cured within 30 day period, then upon the mutual agreement of the Parties the Defaulting Party may be granted an additional period of time during which it shall exercise reasonably diligent efforts to cure such breach, and the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement under this Section during any such mutually agreed extended cure period. Termination for breach or default will have no effect on performance obligations or amounts to be paid which have accrued up to the effective date of such termination. Customer’s failure to make timely payments hereunder following notice of non-payment as required in this section 12.3 shall constitute a breach.

^^Termination for Bankruptcy. In the event of any proceedings, voluntary or involuntary, in bankruptcy or insolvency, by or against Customer or BVL, or the appointment with or without the Parties’ consent of a receiver for either Party, the other Party shall be entitled to immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party without any liability whatsoever. Such termination shall not affect any claim for damages available to the terminating Party or for costs or fees accrued to date.

^^Termination for Force Majeure. In the case of a Force Majeure event that will, or continues to, prevent performance (in whole or substantial part) of this Agreement by a Party for a period of at least three (3) months, the other Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice to the affected Party without any liability whatsoever.

^^Consequences of Expiration/Termination. In the event of any expiration or termination of this Agreement, BVL shall perform such functions requested by Customer that are reasonably necessary or required in connection with the orderly conclusion of any active project as required by the terms of this Agreement and Applicable Law.

12.6.1. Promptly upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or at the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall return to the Disclosing Party all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in its possession. Furthermore, BVL shall promptly return all Customer-supplied Composition, Customer-supplied Equipment, API, retained samples, reference standards, data reports and other property, information and/or know-how in recorded form that was provided by Customer, or Developed in the performance of the services under this

Agreement, that are owned by or licensed to Customer, excepting that required to be retained by Applicable Law, litigation holds or for regulatory compliance.

12.6.2. In the event of termination of BVL pursuant to Section 12.2, Customer shall pay BVL for Manufacturing, Development and other services completed up to the effective date of such termination of this Agreement, the Parties shall meet and confer in good faith in an effort to address disposition of any existing API, inventory, or supplies. Customer: (i) shall purchase from BVL any existing inventories of Product conforming to the Specification and Manufactured in accordance with cGMP and the Manufacturing Process, at the then current price for such Product; and (ii) may either: (1) purchase any Product in process held by BVL as of the date of the termination, at a price to be mutually agreed (it being understood that such price shall reflect, on a pro rata basis, work performed and non-cancelable, out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by BVL with respect to the Manufacture of such in-process Product), (2) reimburse BVL for all work performed and non-cancelable costs, and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by BVL and direct BVL to dispose of such material at Customer’s cost.

12.6.3. BVL shall provide all reasonably requested assistance for technology transfer and otherwise to ensure the orderly transition of the Manufacturing and other services provided hereunder to an alternate source, which shall be provided on a reasonable time and materials basis (provided that BVL must obtain the prior written approval for any required expenditures) or at no cost to Customer if Customer terminates pursuant to Sections 12.3, provided, that no Confidential Information of BVL shall be disclosed to such Alternate Source, it being understood that any Product-specific information contained in the Master Batch Record for Product is not Confidential Information of BVL and may be disclosed to the Alternate Source; and

12.6.4. upon the effective date of termination of this Agreement, Customer shall have no further obligation to BVL with respect to any Purchase Orders with delivery dates beyond such date and BVL will have no further obligations in Manufacture Product, provided that termination or expiration shall have no effect on payment obligations that have accrued up to the effective date of termination.

^^Effect of Termination Under Section 12.2. In addition to Section 12.6, in the event of any termination by Customer pursuant to Section 12.2;

12.7.1. Customer shall pay BVL for its costs of Manufacturing, Development and other services completed up to the effective date of such termination within ** (****) days of Customer’s receipt of all Product, results, reports, data, samples, and other deliverables to be provided pursuant to this Agreement. In the event the funds received by BVL prior to such termination exceed costs incurred to the date of termination, BVL shall refund the difference to Customer within ** (****) days after the effective date of termination.

12.7.2. Customer shall reimburse BVL for the costs of any BVL-supplied Composition that cannot be canceled, unless these materials can be utilized by BVL on other projects. This reimbursement shall be made within **** (****) days after receipt by Customer of an invoice itemizing the material costs. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Customer’s liability for BVL supplied Composition shall be limited to the amount of BVL supplied Composition outlined in section 5.4. BVL agrees to transfer to Customer any materials for which Customer has paid under the provision. Termination shall have no effect on payment obligations that have accrued up to the effective date of termination.

^^Injunctive Relief for Breach or Threatened Breach. The Parties agree that should this Agreement be breached, money damages may be inadequate to remedy such a breach. As a result, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek, and a court of competent jurisdiction may grant, specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

^^No failure on the part of either Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single of partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The waiver of any term, condition, or provision of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving Party. Any such waiver shall not be construed as a waiver of any other term, condition, or provision, nor as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same term, condition, or provision, except as provided in a signed writing.

^^Neither this Agreement, nor any rights or obligations hereunder, may be assigned by either Party hereto without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed; except that either Party may assign this Agreement, without the other Party’s prior written consent, to an entity that: (a) acquired all or substantially all of the business or assets of such Party to which this Agreement pertains (whether by merger, reorganization, acquisition, sale or otherwise); and (b) agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any assignment not permitted by this Section 15.1 shall be void and of no effect whatsoever.

^^This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by Delaware law and, to the extent the laws of the State of Delaware are preempted or otherwise made inapplicable by federal law, the laws of the United States of America. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally:

16.1.1. agrees that any suit, action or legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be instituted in the United States District Court for Delaware, or if such court does not possess subject matter jurisdiction, of any type, or will not accept jurisdiction, in any court of general jurisdiction in Wilmington, Delaware;

16.1.2. consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such foregoing courts in any such suit, action or proceeding;

16.1.3. consents to personal jurisdiction in such courts;

16.1.4. waives any objection which it may have to laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in said courts; and

16.1.5. waives any claim or defense of inconvenient forum.

^^No Party shall be liable for a failure or delay in performing any of its obligations under this Agreement (but, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be liable for any performance actually rendered) if, and only to the extent that such failure or delay (directly or indirectly) is due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including: (i) acts of God; (ii) fire, explosion, or unusually severe weather; (iii) war, whether declared or undeclared, invasion, riot or other material civil unrest; (iv) [enactment or change of laws or regulations by any Agency or Government, conflict of laws or regulations by any Agency or government with the exception of enactments, changes or conflicts where notice of such enactments, changes or conflicts and a corresponding CAPA remediation plan cannot be satisfactorily agreed upon by BVL, Customer and the agency or government who enacted the change], orders, restrictions, actions, embargoes or blockages; (v) national or regional emergency; (vi) injunctions, strikes, lockouts, labor trouble or other industrial disturbances (regardless of the reasonableness of the demands of labor); or (vii) acts of terrorism (“Force Majeure”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that an event shall only rise to the level of “Force Majeure” under section 17.1 (iv) when, following reasonable consultation with the other Party: (a) the Party claiming Force Majeure is substantially and materially prejudiced in its ability to comply with the requirements of this Agreement, (b) the claimed Force Majeure is due to an enactment or change of laws or regulations, and (c) performance is rendered impossible in the short-term or so manifestly burdensome that no reasonable pharmaceutical manufacturing facility of like size and circumstances to BVL would perform under such circumstances.

^^The Party whose performance of this Agreement is affected or potentially affected by a Force Majeure shall promptly notify the other Party of the Force Majeure condition, explaining the nature, details and expected duration thereof, and shall exert reasonable efforts to eliminate, cure or overcome any such condition and to resume performance of its obligations under this Agreement as soon as possible. Upon termination of the event of Force Majeure, the performance of any suspended obligation or duty shall promptly recommence.

^^Title to API and Customer-supplied Composition shall remain with Customer at all stages of the Manufacturing Process and the foregoing shall be held in bailment by BVL. BVL shall provide within the Facility an area or areas where the API, Customer-supplied Composition, Product, any intermediates (and components thereof), and any work in process are segregated and stored in accordance with the Specifications and cGMP, and in such a way as to be able at all times to clearly distinguish the same from products and materials belonging to BVL, or held by it for a Third Party’s account.

^^BVL shall at all times take such measures as are required to protect the API. Customer-supplied Composition, Product, and any work in process from risk of loss or damage at all stages of the Manufacturing Process. BVL shall ensure that the API Customer-supplied Composition, Product, and any work in process are free and clear of any liens or encumbrances. BVL shall immediately notify Customer if at any time it believes any API, Customer-supplied Composition, Product or work in process have been damaged, lost or stolen.

^^This Agreement, together with the Attachments identified herein, embody the entire agreement and understanding between BVL and Customer relating to the subject matter hereof, superseding and hereby terminating the 1993 Agreement, and constituting the entire understanding between the Parties. It is intended as a final expression of their agreement and as a complete statement of terms and conditions thereof. If there is any inconsistency between this Agreement and any other writings, which are referred to or are incorporated herein, or any Purchase Orders, invoices, or other documents relating to Product, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall take precedence in any contract construction. This Agreement supersedes any previous agreements or arrangements between the Parties and any customary practice of the Parties at variance with the terms hereof. Neither Party may rely upon oral representations that are inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.

^^In the event any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a valid, legal and enforceable substitute provision that most nearly reflects the original intent of the Parties and all other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction and shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the intentions of the Parties hereto as nearly as may be possible.

^^Neither Party shall have the right to control the activities of the other in the performance of this Agreement and each shall perform as an independent contractor, and nothing herein shall be construed to be inconsistent with that relationship or status. Under no circumstances shall the employees or Agents of one Party be considered employees or Agents of the other. This Agreement shall not constitute, create, or in any way be interpreted as a joint venture, partnership, or formal business organization of any kind.

^^No provision of this Agreement or the Attachments attached hereto may be modified or supplemented, except by an instrument in writing signed by both BVL and Customer.

^^The Article and Section headings appearing herein are included only for the convenience of reference and are not intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. As used herein, “including”, “includes” and derivates thereof shall be deemed to be followed by “without limitation”.

^^Each party has carefully reviewed this Agreement, and understands its terms. Each Party has been given sufficient opportunity to seek legal advice prior to signing this Agreement, and has either sought legal advice with counsel experienced in issues of confidentiality in regards to this Agreement, or has relied wholly upon that Party’s own judgment and knowledge in executing this Agreement. Each Party fully understands and voluntarily accepts each and every provision contained in this Agreement. Failure to seek legal advice prior to signing this Agreement does not excuse either Party from failure to understand the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement has been prepared on the basis of the mutual understanding of the Parties and in the event of an ambiguity, such as ambiguity shall not be strictly construed against either Party as a drafted of this Agreement.

^^In the event: (a) any agency or governmental authority issues a request, directive, or order that Product be recalled; or (b) a court of competent jurisdiction orders such a recall; or (c) the Customer determines that the Product should be recalled or withdrawn. Customer, in cooperation with BVL shall take all appropriate corrective action. Customer shall also retain the right to conduct a Product recall for any safety reasons Customer deems significant. In the event that Product is recalled or that Customer is required to disseminate information regarding Product covered by this Agreement, Customer shall so notify BVL and, not later than may be required to permit Customer to meet such obligations, BVL shall provide Customer with such assistance in connection with such recall as may reasonably be requested by Customer. Customer shall consult with BVL prior to making any determination to recall

Product if practicable. BVL will be financially responsible for the costs of any recall or withdrawal (including but not limited to the actual cost of manufacturing the Product, through final packaging, pro-rated over the usable portion of the batch, if any) to the extent its negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of any covenant, representation or warranty hereunder is responsible for such recall, provided, that, to the extent any recall or withdrawal includes any Batch(es) not yet released to Customer that are subject to Section 8.5, BVL’s liability for such un-released Batch(es) shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.5 until such release. For the avoidance of doubt, the costs of recall shall be limited to direct costs and expenses associated with the recall (i.e., notices, collection, shipping, destruction) but shall specifically exclude lost profits, lost market share, interruption of business, harm to reputation, or any other indirect collateral cost, such as unrelated marketing, advertising, or any other cost, fee or charge not directly related the recall of Product.

^^This Agreement, all schedules, attachments, and exhibits hereto, and all reports, documents and notices required hereunder, referred to herein or requested by the Parties, in connection with this Agreement shall be written in the English language. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, the binding version of all of the foregoing shall be the English version.

^^Each Party agrees and understands that the information and any materials provided by the other Party under this Agreement are subject to United States laws and regulations, which may restrict certain exports, re-exports or other transfers to other countries and parties. Each Party agrees that no materials or information provided to it under this Agreement by the other Party will be exported re-exported, transferred or disclosed contrary to the applicable laws and regulations of the United States, or to any country, entity or other party which is ineligible to receive such items under U.S. laws and regulations, including the regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Treasury.

^^Each Party understands and acknowledges that the other Party individually or in collaboration with others may now or hereafter develop or market products which compete with its own products or services. Subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in Article 9 and Section 2.3, nothing in this Agreement shall impair the right of either Party to develop, make, use, procure, or market other products or services now or in the future which may be competitive to those products or services offered by the other Party to this Agreement, including without limitation the Products Manufactured pursuant to this Agreement. Neither Party is under a duty to disclose any planning or other information relating to competition with the other’s products or services.

^^BVL shall notify Customer promptly of any change in ownership of BVL, and in no event later than three (3) days of such change being made public.

^^Any books and records to be maintained under this Agreement by a Party or its Affiliates shall be maintained in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, except that the same need not be audited (but if any audits are conducted by a Party, the results of such audits shall be maintained along with such books and records).

^^This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

^^Except as otherwise provided herein, neither Party shall have any right, express or implied, to use in any manner the name or other designation or intellectual property of the other Party or its Affiliates or any other trade name or trademark of the other Party or its Affiliates for any purpose in connection with the performance of this Agreement or otherwise.

^^This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which is an original notwithstanding variations in formal or file designation which may result from the electronic transmission, storage and printing of copies of this Agreement from separate computers or printers.
