^^following the obtaining of an interest in any material Intellectual Property by such Grantor, such Grantor shall deliver a supplement to Schedule II identifying such new Intellectual Property; and 

^^following the obtaining of an interest in any material Intellectual Property by such Grantor or, following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, upon the request of the Collateral Agent, such Grantor shall deliver all agreements, instruments and documents the Collateral Agent may reasonably request to evidence the Collateral Agent’s security interest in such Intellectual Property Collateral and as may otherwise be required to acknowledge or register or perfect the Collateral Agent’s interest in any part of such item of Intellectual Property Collateral unless such Grantor shall determine in good faith (with the consent of the Collateral Agent) that any Intellectual Property Collateral is of negligible economic value to such Grantor. 

^As to Letter-of-Credit Rights. 

^^Each Grantor, by granting a security interest in its Letter-of-Credit Rights to the Collateral Agent, intends to (and hereby does) collaterally assign to the Collateral Agent its rights (including its contingent rights ) to the Proceeds of all Letter-of-Credit Rights of which it is or hereafter becomes a beneficiary or assignee. Promptly following the date on which any Grantor obtains any Letter of Credit Rights after the date hereof, such Grantor shall (i) deliver a supplement to Schedule II identifying such new Letter-of-Credit Right and (ii) with respect to Letter of Credit Rights in excess of $[[USD Value 2]] cause the issuer of each Letter of Credit and each nominated person (if any) with respect thereto to consent to the assignment of the Proceeds thereof to a Senior Collateral Agent (and, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) in a consent agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) and deliver written evidence of such consent to the Collateral Agent. 

^^During the existence of an Event of Default, each Grantor will, promptly upon request by a Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent), (i) notify (and each Grantor hereby authorizes such Senior Collateral Agent (or , after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) to notify) the issuer and each nominated person with respect to each of the Letters of Credit that the Proceeds thereof have been assigned to such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) and any payments due or to become due in respect thereof are to be made directly to such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) and (ii) arrange for such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) to become the transferee beneficiary Letter of Credit. 

^As to Commercial Tort Claims. Each Grantor covenants and agrees that, until the Termination Date, with respect to any Commercial Tort Claim in excess of $[[USD Value 2]] individually or in the aggregate hereafter arising, it shall deliver to the Collateral Agent a supplement to Schedule II in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, identifying such new Commercial Tort Claims. 

^Electronic Chattel Paper and Transferable Records. If any Grantor at any time holds or acquires an interest in any electronic chattel paper or any “transferable record,” as that term is defined in Section 201 of the U.S. Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, or in Section 16 of the U.S. Uniform Electronic Transactions Act as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction, with a value in excess of $[[USD Value 3]] such Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, at the request of a Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent), shall take such action as such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) may request to vest in such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) control (for the ratable benefit of Secured Parties) under Section 9-105 of the UCC of such electronic chattel paper or control under Section 201 of the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act or, as the case may be, Section 16 of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, as so in effect in such jurisdiction, of such transferable record. The Collateral Agent agrees with each Grantor that, if such control has been vested in it, the Collateral Agent will arrange, pursuant to procedures reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and so long as such procedures will not result in the Collateral Agent’s loss of control, for such Grantor to make alterations to the electronic chattel paper or transferable record permitted under Section 9-105 of the UCC or, as the case may be, Section 201 of the U.S. Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act or Section 16 of the U.S. Uniform Electronic Transactions Act for a party in control to allow without loss of control, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur after taking into account any action by such Grantor with respect to such electronic chattel paper or transferable record. 

^Transfers and Other Liens. No Grantor shall: (a) sell, assign (by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of any of the Collateral, except Inventory in the ordinary course of business or as specifically permitted by the Indenture or any Senior Obligations Governing Documents, or (b) create or suffer to exist any Lien or other charge or encumbrance upon or with respect to any of the Collateral to secure Debt of any Person or entity, except for the security interest created by this Security Agreement and except for Permitted Liens. 

^Taxes. Each Grantor agrees to comply in all material respects with all applicable law, including the appropriate payment (before the same become delinquent), by, or on behalf of, such Grantor of all taxes imposed upon such Grantor or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries or upon their property except to the extent being diligently contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP have been set aside on the books of such Grantor or such Subsidiaries, as applicable. 

^Further Assurances, etc. Each Grantor shall warrant and defend the right, title and interest herein granted unto the Collateral Agent in and to the Collateral (and all right, title and interest represented by the Collateral) against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever. Each Grantor agrees that, from time to time at its own expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all further action, that may be necessary or that the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in order to perfect, preserve and protect the security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby in all material portions of the Collateral (subject to the terms hereof and of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) or to enable the Collateral Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral. Each Grantor agrees that, upon the acquisition after the date hereof by such Grantor of any Collateral, with respect to which the security interest granted hereunder is not perfected automatically upon such acquisition, to take such actions with respect to such Collateral or any part thereof as required by the Indenture Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor will: 

^^from time to time upon the request of a Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent), promptly deliver to such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) such stock powers, instruments and similar documents, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent), with respect to such Collateral as such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) may reasonably request and will from time to time upon the request of a Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent), after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, promptly transfer any securities constituting Collateral into the name of any nominee designated by such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent); if any Collateral shall be evidenced by an Instrument, negotiable Document, Promissory Note or tangible Chattel Paper, deliver and pledge to a Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) such Instrument, negotiable Document, Promissory Note, Pledged Note or tangible Chattel Paper duly endorsed and accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent); 

^^file (and hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to file after delivery of a copy thereof to such Grantor) such filing statements or continuation statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices (including any assignment of claim form under or pursuant to the federal assignment of claims statute, 31 U.S.C. § 3726, any successor or amended version thereof or any regulation promulgated under or pursuant to any version thereof), as may be necessary or that the Collateral Agent may request in order to perfect and preserve the security interests and other rights granted or purported to be granted to the Collateral Agent hereby. The authorization contained in this Section 4.12 shall be irrevocable and continuing until the Termination Date; 

^^deliver to a Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) and at all times keep pledged to the Collateral Agent pursuant hereto, on a first-priority, perfected basis (except for Permitted Liens), at the request of such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent), all Investment Property constituting Collateral, all Distributions with respect thereto (which shall only be delivered to a Senior Collateral Agent or the Collateral Agent during the continuance of a Default), and all interest and principal with respect to Promissory Notes, and all Proceeds and rights from time to time received by or distributable to such Grantor in respect of any of the foregoing Collateral; 

^^not take or omit to take any action the taking or the omission of which would result in any impairment or alteration of any obligation of the maker of any Payment Intangible or other Instrument constituting Collateral, except as provided in Section 4.4; 

^^not create any tangible Chattel Paper without placing a legend on such tangible Chattel Paper reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent indicating that the Collateral Agent has a security interest in such Chattel Paper; 

^^furnish to the Collateral Agent, from time to time at the Collateral Agent’s request, statements and schedules further identifying and describing the Collateral and such other reports in connection with the Collateral as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, all in reasonable detail; and 

^^do all things reasonably requested by a Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) in accordance with this Security Agreement in order to enable such Senior Collateral Agent (or, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Collateral Agent) to have and maintain control over the Collateral consisting of Investment Property, Deposit Accounts, Letter-of-Credit-Rights and Electronic Chattel Paper. 

Each Grantor agrees that a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Security Agreement or any UCC financing statement covering the Collateral or any part thereof shall be sufficient as a UCC financing statement where permitted by law. Each Grantor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to file financing statements describing as the collateral covered thereby “all of the debtor’s personal property or assets”, “all assets” or words to that effect, notwithstanding that such wording may be broader in scope than the Collateral described in this Security Agreement. 

^Insurance. Each Grantor will maintain with financially sound and reputable insurance companies such insurance in such amounts and against such risks as may be customary in the case of reputable Persons of similar size engaged in the same or similar lines of business, including without limitation property insurance with respect to all tangible Collateral and comprehensive general public liability insurance, or will self-insure to the extent customary for reputable Persons of similar size engaged in the same or similar lines of business. Each such policy of insurance shall contain the insurer’s promise not to cancel the policy or allow the policy to lapse without renewal without 30 days’ prior written notice to the Collateral Agent and shall name the Collateral Agent as an additional insured or (subject to the rights and interest of the holders of any Senior Obligations) lender loss payee, as appropriate, as its interests may appear. Each Grantor will promptly notify the Collateral Agent of any loss or material damage to any material part of the Collateral. 

^Compliance with the TIA. To the extent applicable, the Company will comply with TIA Section 314(b), relating to opinions of counsel regarding the Liens and security interest created pursuant to this Security Agreement and the other Indenture Documents.

\centered **THE COLLATERAL AGENT** 

^Collateral Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. Each Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent its attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or otherwise, from time to time in the Collateral Agent’s discretion, following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to take any action and to execute any instrument which the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Security Agreement, including (a) to ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compromise, receive and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under or in respect of any of the Collateral, (b) to receive, endorse, and collect any drafts or other Instruments, Documents and Chattel Paper, in connection with clause (a) above, (c) to file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings which the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or desirable for the collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to enforce the rights of the Collateral Agent with respect to any of the Collateral, and (d) to perform the affirmative obligations of such Grantor hereunder. **EACH GRANTOR HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES, CONSENTS AND AGREES THAT THE POWER OF ATTORNEY GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 5.1 IS IRREVOCABLE AND COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND SHALL BE EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE TERMINATION DATE.** 

^Collateral Agent May Perform. If any Grantor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, the Collateral Agent may itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by such Grantor pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof and the Collateral Agent may from time to time take any other action which the Collateral Agent reasonably deems necessary for the maintenance, preservation or protection of any of the Collateral or of its security interest therein. 

^Collateral Agent Has No Duty. The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest (on behalf of the Secured Parties) in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty on it to exercise any such powers. Except for reasonable care of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or responsibility for (a) ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Investment Property and any other Pledged Property, whether or not the Collateral Agent has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or (b) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. 

^Reasonable Care. The Collateral Agent is required to exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any of the Collateral in its possession; provided, that the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any of the Collateral (a) if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Collateral Agent accords its own personal property, or (b) if the Collateral Agent takes such action for that purpose as any Grantor reasonably requests in writing at times other than upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default; provided, further, that failure of the Collateral Agent to comply with any such request at any time shall not in itself be deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care. 

\centered **REMEDIES** 

^Certain Remedies. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing: 

^^The Collateral Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral) and also may (i) take possession of any Collateral not already in its possession without demand and without legal process, (ii) require any Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it will, at its expense and upon request of the Collateral Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by the Collateral Agent and make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place to be designated by the Collateral Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties, (iii) subject to applicable law or agreements with landlords, enter onto the property where any Collateral is located and take possession thereof without demand and without legal process, (iv) without notice except as specified below, lease, license, sell or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Collateral Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the Collateral Agent may deem commercially reasonable. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten (10) days’ prior notice to the applicable Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time of any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification; provided, however, that with respect to Collateral that is (x) perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value, or (y) is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market (including but not limited to, Investment Property), no notice of sale or disposition need be given. For purposes of this Article VI, notice of any intended sale or disposition of any Collateral may be given by first-class mail, hand-delivery (through a delivery service or otherwise), facsimile or email, and shall be deemed to have been “sent” upon deposit in the U.S. Mails with adequate postage properly affixed, upon delivery to an express delivery service or upon electronic submission through telephonic or internet services, as applicable. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. 

^^Each Grantor agrees and acknowledges that a commercially reasonable disposition of Inventory, Equipment, Goods, Computer Hardware and Software Collateral, or Intellectual Property may be by lease or license of, in addition to the sale of, such Collateral. Each Grantor further agrees and acknowledges that each of the following shall be deemed a reasonable commercial disposition: (i) a disposition made in the usual manner on any recognized market, (ii) a disposition at the price current in any recognized market at the time of disposition, and (iii) a disposition in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property subject to the disposition. 

^^All cash Proceeds received by the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral shall be, subject to the rights and interests of the holders of any Senior Obligations, applied by the Collateral Agent against all or any part of the Secured Obligations as set forth in the Indenture. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to apply or pay over for application noncash proceeds of collection or enforcement unless (i) the failure to do so would be commercially unreasonable, and (ii) the affected party has provided the Collateral Agent with a written demand to apply or pay over such noncash proceeds on such basis. 

^^The Collateral Agent may do any or all of the following: (i) transfer all or any part of the Collateral into the name of the Collateral Agent or its nominee, with or without disclosing that such Collateral is subject to the Lien hereunder, (ii) notify the parties obligated on any of the Collateral to make payment to the Collateral Agent of any amount due or to become due thereunder, (iii) withdraw, or cause or direct the withdrawal, of all funds with respect to any Collateral Account or any other Deposit Account subject to an Account Control Agreement, (iv) enforce collection of any of the Collateral by suit or otherwise, and surrender, release or exchange all or any part thereof, or compromise or extend or renew for any period (whether or not longer than the original period) any obligations of any nature of any party with respect thereto, (v) endorse any checks, drafts, or other writings in the applicable Grantor’s name to allow collection of the Collateral, (vi) take control of any Proceeds of the Collateral, or (vii) execute (in the name, place and stead of the applicable Grantor) endorsements, assignments, stock powers and other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to all or any of the Collateral. 

^Securities Laws. If the Collateral Agent shall determine to exercise its right to sell all or any of the Collateral that are Equity Interests pursuant to Section 6.1, each Grantor agrees that, upon request of the Collateral Agent, such Grantor will, at its own expense: 

^^execute and deliver, and cause (or, with respect to any issuer which is not a Subsidiary of such Grantor, use its reasonable efforts to cause) each Pledged Interests Issuer or other issuer of the Collateral contemplated to be sold and the directors and officers thereof to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts and things, as may be necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Agent, advisable to register such Collateral under the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as from time to time amended (the “Securities Act”), and cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to remain effective for such period as prospectuses are required by law to be furnished, and to make all amendments and supplements thereto and to the related prospectus which, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; 

^^use its reasonable efforts to exempt the Collateral under the state securities or “Blue Sky” laws and to obtain all necessary Governmental Approvals for the sale of the Collateral, as requested by the Collateral Agent; 

^^cause (or, with respect to any issuer that is not a Subsidiary of such Grantor, use its reasonable efforts to cause) each such Pledged Interests Issuer or other issuer to make available to its security holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement that will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act; and 

^^do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary to make such sale of the Collateral or any part thereof valid and binding and in compliance with applicable law. 

Each Grantor acknowledges the impossibility of ascertaining the amount of damages that would be suffered by the Collateral Agent or the Secured Parties by reason of the failure by such Grantor to perform any of the covenants contained in this Section and consequently agrees that, if such Grantor shall fail to perform any of such covenants, it shall pay, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an amount equal to the value (as reasonably determined by the Collateral Agent in good faith) of such Collateral on the date the Collateral Agent shall demand compliance with this Section 6.2. 

^Compliance with Restrictions. Each Grantor agrees that in any sale of any of the Collateral whenever an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to comply with any limitation or restriction in connection with such sale as it may be advised by counsel is necessary in order to avoid any violation of applicable law (including compliance with such procedures as may restrict the number of prospective bidders and purchasers, require that such prospective bidders and purchasers have certain qualifications, and restrict such prospective bidders and purchasers to Persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale of such Collateral), or in order to obtain any required approval of the sale or of the purchaser by any Governmental Authority or official, and each Grantor further agrees that such compliance shall not result in such sale being considered or deemed not to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner, nor shall the Collateral Agent be liable nor accountable to such Grantor for any discount allowed by the reason of the fact that such Collateral is sold in compliance with any such limitation or restriction. 

^Indemnity and Expenses. 

^^Each Grantor hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the Collateral Agent, each Secured Party and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, losses and liabilities arising out of or resulting from this Security Agreement or any other Indenture Document (including, without limitation, enforcement of this Security Agreement), except claims, losses or liabilities resulting from such Indemnified Party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or unlawful acts; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY BE INDEMNIFIED IN THE CASE OF ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE (OTHER THAN GROSS NEGLIGENCE), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE IS SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, IMPUTED, JOINT OR TECHNICAL. If and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking may be unenforceable for any reason, each Grantor hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the foregoing which is permissible under applicable law. 

^^Other than as set forth in clause (c) below, each Grantor will upon demand pay to the Collateral Agent and any counsel the amount of any and all expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of its counsel and of any experts and agents, which the Collateral Agent and any counsel may incur in connection herewith, including without limitation in connection with the administration of this Security Agreement and the custody, preservation, use or operation of, any of the Collateral. 

^^Each Grantor will upon demand pay to the Collateral Agent and any counsel the amount of any and all expenses, including the fees and disbursements of its counsel and of any experts and agents, which the Collateral Agent and any counsel may incur in connection with (i) the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the Collateral, (ii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the Collateral Agent or any of the Secured Parties hereunder, or (iii) the failure by any Grantor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof. 

^Warranties. The Collateral Agent may sell the Collateral without giving any warranties or representations as to the Collateral. The Collateral Agent may disclaim any warranties of title or the like. Each Grantor agrees that this procedure will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.

Accordingly, the Collateral Agent and the New Grantor agree as follows: 

^In accordance with Section 8.11 of the Security Agreement, the New Grantor by its signature below becomes a Grantor under the Security Agreement with the same force and effect as if originally named therein as a Grantor and the New Grantor hereby agrees (a) to all the terms and provisions of the Security Agreement applicable to it as a Grantor thereunder and (b) represents and warrants that the representations and warranties made by it as a Grantor thereunder are true and correct on and as of the date hereof.
