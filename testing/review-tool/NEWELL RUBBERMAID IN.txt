**RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT** 

^Restricted Stock Unit (“RSU”) Award (the “Award”) granted by Newell Rubbermaid Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), to the employee named in the attached Award letter (the “Grantee”) relating to the common stock, par value $[[USD Value 1: Number]] per share (the “Common Stock”), of the Company, shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and the provisions of the Newell Rubbermaid Inc. 2003 Stock Plan, as amended and restated effective [[Date 1]] and further amended [[Date 2: Date]] (the “Plan”), a copy of which is attached hereto and the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference. 

^Acceptance by Grantee. The receipt of the Award is conditioned upon its acceptance by the Grantee in the space provided therefor at the end of the attached Award letter and the return of an executed copy of such Award letter to the Secretary of the Company no later than 60 days after the Award Date set forth therein or, if later, 30 days after the Grantee receives this Agreement.

^Grant of RSUs. The Company hereby grants to the Grantee the Award of RSUs, as set forth in the Award letter. An RSU is the right, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, to receive a distribution of a share of Common Stock for each RSU as described in Section 7 of this Agreement.

^RSU Account. The Company shall maintain an account (“RSU Account”) on its books in the name of the Grantee which shall reflect the number of RSUs awarded to the Grantee.

^Dividend Equivalents.

^^*Time-Based RSUs.* Upon the payment of any dividend on Common Stock occurring during the period preceding the earlier of the date of vesting of the Grantee’s Award or the date the Grantee’s Award is forfeited as described with Section 5, the Company shall promptly pay to each Grantee an amount in cash equal in value to the dividends that the Grantee would have received had the Grantee been the actual owner of the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the Time-Based RSUs in the Grantee’s RSU Account on that date.

^^*Performance-Based RSUs*. Upon the payment of any dividend on Common Stock occurring during the period preceding the earlier of the date of vesting of the Grantee’s Award or the date the Grantee’s Award is forfeited as described with Section 5, the Company shall credit the Grantee’s RSU Account with an amount equal in value to the dividends that the Grantee would have received had the Grantee been the actual owner of the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the Performance-Based RSUs in the Grantee’s RSU Account on that date. Such amounts shall be paid to the Grantee in cash at the time and to the extent the related Performance-Based RSUs vest. The amount of dividend equivalents payable to the Grantee shall be adjusted to reflect the adjustment made to the related RSUs pursuant to Section 6 (which shall be determined by multiplying such amount by the percentage adjustment made to the related RSUs). Any such dividend equivalents relating to Performance-Based RSUs that are forfeited shall also be forfeited.

^Vesting.

^^Except as described in (b), (c) and (d) below, the Grantee shall become vested in his Award upon the third anniversary of the date of the grant of the Award (the “Award Date”) if he remains in continuous employment with the Company or an affiliate until such date.

^^If the Grantee’s employment with the Company and all affiliates terminates prior to the third anniversary of the Award Date due to death or disability, the Award shall become vested on such

date. For this purpose “disability” means (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion) the inability of the Grantee to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which is expected to result in death or disability or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.

^^If the Grantee’s employment with the Company and all affiliates terminates prior to the third anniversary of the Award Date due to retirement, (i) Time-Based RSUs shall become vested on the date of such termination as provided in the table set forth below; and (ii) Performance-Based RSUs shall remain outstanding until the third anniversary of the Award Date, at which time they will vest as provided in the table set forth below. The portion of the Award that does not vest as provided below shall be forfeited to the Company. For this purpose, “retirement” means the Grantee’s termination without cause on or after the date on which the Grantee (i) has completed five years of credited service and (ii) either (A) has attained age 65 or (B) has attained age 55 and the sum of his age and credited service (his “points”) equals or exceeds 60.

**Age or Points**      \centered **Vesting**
Age 65 or 75 or more points      [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the Award vests for an Award made 12 or more months prior to retirement  [[Percentage 1]]% of the Pro-Rated Award vests for an Award made less than 12 months prior to retirement

^^-74 points      [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the Pro-Rated Award vests

^^-69 points      [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the Pro-Rated Award vests

^^-64 points      [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of the Pro-Rated Award vests

For purposes of this subsection (c): 

^The term “credited service” means the Grantee’s period of employment with the Company and all affiliates (including any predecessor company or business acquired by the Company or any affiliate, provided the Grantee was immediately employed by the Company or any affiliate). Age and credited service shall be determined in fully completed years and months, with each month being measured as a continuous period of 30 days.

^The term “cause” means the Grantee’s termination of employment due to unsatisfactory performance or conduct detrimental to the Company or its affiliates, as determined solely by the Company.

^The term “affiliate” means each entity with whom the Company would be considered a single employer under Sections 414(b) and 414(c) of the Code, substituting “at least [[Percentage 3]]%” instead of “at least [[Percentage 5: Number]]%” in making such determination.

^The term “Pro-Rated Award” means (A) with respect to an Award granted less than 12 months prior to the Grantee’s retirement, and on the date of such retirement the Grantee has either attained age 65 or has 75 or more points, the portion of the Award determined by dividing the number of full months of employment with the Company and all affiliates from the Award’s grant date by 12; and (B) with respect to all other Awards, the portion of the Award determined by dividing the full number of months of employment with the Company and all affiliates from the Award’s grant date by 36 (in each case carried out to three decimal points).

Any Grantee whose employment terminates due to retirement as described in this Section 5(c) must execute and deliver to the Company an agreement, in a form prescribed by the Company, and 

in accordance with procedures established by the Company, that he will not solicit employees, customers or suppliers of the Company and its affiliates, or compete with the Company and its affiliates, and that he releases all claims against the Company and its affiliates. If the Grantee fails to execute such agreement, or if the agreement is revoked by the Grantee, the Award shall be forfeited to the Company on the date of the Grantee’s retirement. 

^^If the Grantee’s employment with the Company and all affiliates terminates prior to the third anniversary of the Award Date for any reason other than death, disability or retirement, the entire Award shall be forfeited to the Company, and no portion of the Award shall vest.

^^In the case of a Grantee who is also a Director, if the Grantee’s employment with the Company and all affiliates terminates before the end of the Award’s three-year vesting period, but the Grantee remains a Director, his service on the Board will be considered employment with the Company and his Award will continue to vest while his service on the Board continues. Any subsequent termination of service on the Board will be considered termination of employment and vesting will determined as of the date of such termination of employment.

The foregoing provisions of this Section 5 shall be subject to the provisions of any written employment security agreement or severance agreement that has been or may be executed by the Grantee and the Company, and the provisions in such employment security agreement or severance agreement concerning vesting of an Award shall supersede any inconsistent or contrary provision of this Section 5. 

^Adjustment of Performance-Based RSUs. The number of RSUs subject to the Award that are Performance-Based RSUs as described in the Award letter shall be adjusted by the Committee after the end of the three-year performance period that begins on [[Date 3: Date]] of the year in which the Award is granted, in accordance with in the Long-Term Incentive Plan established under the Plan (the “LTIP”). Any Performance-Based RSUs that vest in accordance with Section 5(b) prior to the date the Committee determines the level of performance goal achievement applicable to such RSUs shall not be adjusted pursuant to the LTIP. The particular performance criteria that applies to the Performance-Based RSUs are set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement.

^Settlement of Award. If a Grantee becomes vested in his Award in accordance with Section 5, the Company shall distribute to him, or his personal representative, beneficiary or estate, as applicable, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of vested RSUs subject to the Award, as adjusted in accordance with Section 6, if applicable. Such shares shall be delivered within 30 days following the date of vesting.

^Withholding Taxes. The Company shall withhold from any distribution made to the Grantee in cash an amount sufficient to satisfy all minimum Federal, state and local withholding tax requirements. In the case of a distribution made in shares of Common Stock, the Grantee shall pay to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy all minimum Federal, state and local withholding tax requirements prior to the delivery of any shares. Payment of such taxes may be made by one or more of the following methods: (i) in cash, (ii) in cash received from a broker-dealer to whom the Grantee has submitted irrevocable instructions to deliver the amount of withholding tax to the Company from the proceeds of the sale of shares subject to the Award, (iii) by directing the Company to withhold a number of shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the tax required to be withheld, (iv) by delivery to the Company of other Common Stock owned by the Grantee that is acceptable to the Company, valued at its Fair Market Value on the date of payment, or (v) by certifying to ownership by attestation of such previously owned Common Stock.

^Rights as Stockholder. The Grantee shall not be entitled to any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Award, including the right to vote and to receive dividends and other distributions, until and to the extent the Award is settled in shares of Common Stock.

^Share Delivery. Delivery of any shares in connection with settlement of the Award will be by book-entry credit to an account in the Grantee’s name established by the Company with the Company’s transfer agent, or upon written request from the Grantee (or his personal representative, beneficiary or estate, as the case may be), in certificates in the name of the Grantee (or his personal representative, beneficiary or estate).

^Award Not Transferable. The Award may not be transferred other than by will or the applicable laws of descent or distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order. The Award shall not otherwise be assigned, transferred, or pledged for any purpose whatsoever and is not subject, in whole or in part, to attachment, execution or levy of any kind. Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, or encumbrance of the Award, other than in accordance with its terms, shall be void and of no effect.

^Administration. The Award shall be administered in accordance with such regulations as the Organizational Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Committee”) shall from time to time adopt.

^Section 409A Compliance. To the extent that the Grantee’s right to receive payment of the RSUs and dividend equivalents constitutes a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, the shares of Common Stock and cash otherwise deliverable under Sections 4 and 6 shall be subject to the following rules:

^^The shares of Common Stock underlying the vested RSUs and the related dividend equivalents shall be delivered to the Grantee, or his personal representative, beneficiary or estate, as applicable, within 30 days following the earlier of (i) the Grantee’s “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, subject to Section 13(b); (ii) the occurrence of a Change in Control that also constitutes a “change in the ownership,” a “change in the effective control” or a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets” of the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; or (iii) the third anniversary of the Award Date.

^^Notwithstanding Section 13(a), if any Time-Based RSUs and related dividend equivalents become payable under Section 13(a)(i) as a result of the Grantee’s termination of employment due to retirement or disability and the Grantee is a “specified employee,” as determined under the Company’s policy for determining specified employees on the date of such separation from service, then the shares of Common Stock underlying the vested RSUs and related dividends shall be delivered to the Grantee, or his personal representative, beneficiary or estate, as applicable, within 30 days after the first business day that is more than six months after the date of his or her separation from service (or, if the Grantee dies during such six-month period, within 30 days after the Grantee’s death).

^^In the event that any taxes described in Section 8 of this Agreement are due prior to the distribution of shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs, then the Grantee shall be required to satisfy the tax obligation by using the method set forth in Section 8(i).
