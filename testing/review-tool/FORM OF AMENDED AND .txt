^^^^^ 
WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) has approved this amendment and restatement of the Original Agreement; 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants, representations and warranties made herein and of the mutual benefits to be derived herefrom, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

Section 1.    Board Representation.

^^Each Executive Stockholder and Carlyle Stockholder shall vote all of the Voting Shares over which such Executive Stockholder or such Carlyle Stockholder has voting control and shall take all other necessary or desirable actions within such Executive Stockholder’s or such Carlyle Stockholder’s control (whether in such Executive Stockholder’s or such Carlyle Stockholder’s capacity as a stockholder, director, member of a Board committee or officer of the Company or otherwise, and including, without limitation, attendance at meetings in person or by proxy for purposes of obtaining a quorum, execution of written consents in lieu of meetings, and approval of amendments and/or restatements of the Company’s certificate of incorporation or by-laws) so that (i) the authorized number of directors (the “Directors”) on the Board shall be at least six and no greater than nine and (ii) the Directors shall be the persons nominated or designated in accordance with this Section 1. The smallest number of Directors as shall constitute a majority of the total number of Directors from time to time authorized to serve on the Board shall be designated for nomination for election by the Carlyle Stockholders; provided, however, that not more than three of such designees of the Carlyle Stockholders at any time may be full-time employees of the Carlyle Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries), and any additional such designees of the Carlyle Stockholders at any time shall be designated for nomination for election after consultation with the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Two of the Directors shall be designated for nomination for election by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and shall be full-time employees of BAH; provided, however, that at any time when the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is a natural person who has not been a full-time employee of BAH for at least five years, such two Directors shall instead be designated for nomination for election by the Executive Stockholders holding a majority of the Voting Shares held by all Executive Stockholders (in either case, the individuals designated pursuant to this sentence shall be referred to as the “Executive Directors”). Any remaining Directors shall be jointly designated for nomination for election by the Chief Executive Officer and the Carlyle Stockholders; provided, however, that if (x) the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is a natural person who has not been a full-time employee of BAH for at least five years, (y) such Chief Executive Officer of the Company has not been designated as a Executive Director, and (z) the Carlyle Stockholders determine that such Chief Executive Officer of the Company should serve as a Director, such Chief Executive Officer shall be so designated for nomination for election and shall constitute one of such remaining Directors. Any Directors (other than the Chief Executive Officer of the Company) designated pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, and any Directors designated by the Carlyle Stockholders who are not full-time employees of the Carlyle Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries) and were designated after 

^^^^^ 
consultation with the Chief Executive Officer of the Company are hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Unaffiliated Directors”. 

^^The Company shall cause the individuals designated in accordance with Section 1(a) to be nominated for election to the Board, shall solicit proxies in favor thereof, and at each meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which directors of the Company are to be elected, shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company elect to the Board each such individual nominated for election at such meeting. 

^^Except as would be contrary to any applicable law, rule or regulation (including any rule or regulation of any exchange upon which securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries may be listed), each committee of the Board, and each committee of the board of directors of Buyer, BAH and, unless otherwise determined by the Board, each other subsidiary of the Company, shall include at least one Executive Director; provided, however that following an IPO no Executive Director shall serve on any audit or compensation committee of any of the foregoing. 

^^Subject to the provisions of the Company’s certificate of incorporation, a Director may be removed from the Board upon the request of the Person or group of Persons that designated such Director, and not otherwise; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impair any rights that the Stockholders of the Company may have to remove any Director for cause; provided, further, that any Executive Director shall be removed automatically from the Board upon such Executive Director’s Termination of Service. 

^^In the event that any Director for any reason ceases to serve as a member of the Board during his term of office, the Person or group of Persons who designated such Director shall have the right to designate for appointment by the remaining Directors of the Company an individual to fill the vacant directorship. Each of the Company, the Carlyle Stockholders and the Executive Stockholders agrees to take such actions as will result in the appointment as soon as practicable of any individual so designated by each such Person or group of Persons. 

^^At such time as the Carlyle Stockholders cease collectively to own and have the power to dispose of Company Common Stock, Company Non-Voting Common Stock and Company Restricted Common Stock representing at least forty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the interests in the Company represented by all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company Non-Voting Common Stock and Company Restricted Common Stock, the Carlyle Stockholders and the Executive Stockholders shall discuss and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon, and, subject to Section 16(k), shall amend this Agreement to effect, appropriate amendments to this Section 1 and such other provisions of this Agreement as shall be appropriate, in each case to be consistent with the ownership position of the Carlyle Stockholders at that time. 

^^For so long as the Company qualifies as a “controlled company” under the applicable listing standards then in effect, the Company will elect to be a “controlled company” for purposes of such applicable listing standards, and will disclose in its annual meeting proxy 

^^^^^ 
statement that it is a “controlled company” and the basis for that determination. The Company, the Carlyle Stockholders and the Executive Stockholders acknowledge and agree that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Company is a “controlled company.” After the Company ceases to qualify as a “controlled company” under applicable listing standards then in effect, each of the Carlyle Stockholders and the Executive Stockholders acknowledges that a sufficient number of their designees will be required to qualify as “independent directors” to ensure that the Board complies with such applicable listing standards in the time periods required by the applicable listing standards then in effect, and shall discuss and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon appropriate changes to their designees consistent with the foregoing. 

Section 2.    Restrictions on Transfer.

Except for (a) Transfers following the day that is one hundred eighty (180) days (or such shorter or longer period as agreed upon by the underwriters and the Company to be appropriate) after the consummation of the IPO; (b) Transfers effected by the Executive Stockholders pursuant to the exercise of Bring-Along Rights by the Carlyle Stockholders pursuant to Section 4 below; (c) Transfers effected pursuant to the Proxy and Tag-Along Agreements; (d) Transfers effected pursuant to Section 6 below, and (e) any Permitted Transfer (as defined in Section 5), no Individual Stockholder shall Transfer any Securities without the prior written approval of the Company. Each Individual Stockholder further agrees that in connection with any Permitted Transfer, such Individual Stockholder shall, if requested by the Company, deliver to the Company an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and counsel for the Company, to the effect that such Transfer is not in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any state. Any purported Transfer in violation of the provisions of this Section 2 shall be null and void and shall have no force or effect. It shall be a condition to any Permitted Transfer and (unless waived by the Company) any Transfer by any Individual Stockholder approved by the Company, that the transferee shall (i) agree to become a Party to this Agreement as a “Management Stockholder” or an “Other Stockholder”, as the case may be, (ii) execute a signature page in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto acknowledging that such transferee agrees to be bound by the terms hereof and (iii) if such transferee is a natural person and a resident of a state with a community or marital property system, cause such transferee’s spouse to execute a spousal waiver in the form attached as Exhibit B. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company agrees that any Management Stockholder may pledge or otherwise use Company Common Stock, vested Company Restricted Common Stock or Company Non-Voting Common Stock to secure financing from a lender (a “Lender”) in connection with payment of the exercise price with respect to any Company Option or the payment of any withholding or other taxes due in connection with any Security issued under the Equity Incentive Plan, Company Rollover Stock Plan or any similar equity-based plan approved by the Board; provided, however, that the Lender shall be acceptable to the Company and the terms of any such pledge or other financing shall (i) provide that the Lender or any Person (a “Foreclosure Transferee”) to whom ownership of the pledged Company Common Stock or Company Non-Voting Common Stock is transferred upon default, foreclosure or like events (the “Foreclosed Securities”) shall upon taking ownership of any such Foreclosed Securities become a party to this Agreement and be subject to the terms and 

^^^^^ 
provisions of the Company Rollover Stock Plan, the Equity Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plan of the Company, as applicable, and any award agreement to which the Foreclosed Securities transferred to the Foreclosure Transferee were subject immediately prior to such Transfer; (ii) provide that upon and following any such transfer of ownership of any such Foreclosed Securities the Company may, without any action or consent of the Lender or any holder or owner thereof, convert any Company Common Stock to Company Non-Voting Common Stock, (iii) in addition to any right to repurchase the Foreclosed Securities pursuant to the Company Rollover Stock Plan or Section 8, provide the Company with the right to repurchase the Foreclosed Securities at their Fair Market Value during the period beginning on the date the Company becomes aware of the transfer of the Foreclosed Securities and ending on the date nine (9) months thereafter and (iv) be otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Company. Any such repurchase shall be subject to the same notice and delay provisions as shares purchased on Termination of Service pursuant to Section 8. 

Section 3.    Leadership Team.

^^For so long as any Management Stockholder serves as a member of the Leadership Team, such Management Stockholder, together with each of such Management Stockholder’s Permitted Transferees, shall be an “Executive Stockholder” for the purposes of this Agreement and such Management Stockholder shall execute a joinder to this Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-3. 

^^At such time as any Management Stockholder ceases to serve as a member of the Leadership Team, such Management Stockholder, together with each of such Management Stockholder’s Permitted Transferees, shall cease to be an “Executive Stockholder” for the purposes of this Agreement and such Management Stockholder shall execute a separation agreement, solely with respect to such Management Stockholder’s and each of such Management Stockholder’s Permitted Transferees’ status as an Executive Stockholder under this Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to contrary herein, nothing in this Section 3 shall affect any rights or obligations that any Person may otherwise have as a Management Stockholder, Other Stockholder or Individual Stockholder and, for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Section 1, Section 4 and Section 16(m) of this Agreement shall not apply to any Individual Stockholders other than the Executive Stockholders. 

Section 4.    Bring-Along Rights.

^^If one or more Carlyle Stockholders, in one transaction or a series of related transactions that would constitute both a Company Sale and a Change in Control (as defined in the Company Rollover Stock Plan), propose(s) to Transfer any Securities to one or more Persons other than an Affiliate of the Carlyle Stockholders (each such Person, a “Third Party Purchaser”), then the Carlyle Stockholders shall have the right (a “Bring-Along Right”), but not the obligation, to require each Executive Stockholder that is an Executive Stockholder both upon receipt of the Bring-Along Notice (defined below) and upon the closing of the proposed Transfer to sell to the Third Party Purchaser(s), on the Same Terms and Conditions as apply to the Carlyle 

^^^^^ 
Stockholders exercising their Bring-Along Right, that number of Securities equal to (i) the total number of Securities owned by such Executive Stockholder multiplied by (ii) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the total number of Securities to be sold by the Carlyle Stockholders in connection with such transaction or series of related transactions and (B) the denominator of which is the total number of the Securities collectively held by all Carlyle Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4, if the Carlyle Stockholders require an Executive Stockholder to sell any Company Options issued under the Company Rollover Stock Plan to a Third Party Purchaser pursuant to this Section 4, such Executive Stockholder (and, if applicable, a Permitted Transferee and/or Related Trust of such Executive Stockholder) shall also sell, for no additional consideration, a corresponding number of shares of Company Special Voting Stock to such Third Party Purchaser. 

^^Any Carlyle Stockholders exercising their Bring-Along Right under this Section 4 shall deliver a written notice (a “Bring-Along Notice”) to each Executive Stockholder. The Bring-Along Notice shall set forth: (i) the name of the Third Party Purchaser(s) and the number of Securities proposed to be sold by the Carlyle Stockholders to such Third Party Purchaser(s); (ii) the proposed amount and form of consideration and material terms and conditions of payment offered to such Executive Stockholder by the Third Party Purchaser(s) and a summary of any other material terms pertaining to the Transfer (the “Third Party Terms”); and (iii) the number of Securities that such Executive Stockholder shall be required to sell in such Transfer (as determined in accordance with Section 4(a) above). The Bring-Along Notice shall be given at least fifteen (15) Business Days before the closing of the proposed Transfer. 

^^Upon each Executive Stockholder’s receipt of a Bring-Along Notice, such Executive Stockholder shall be obligated to sell such number of Securities as is set forth in the Bring-Along Notice on the Third Party Terms; provided, however, that no Executive Stockholder shall be required to bear more than such Executive Stockholder’s pro rata share (determined based on the number of Securities sold in the transactions contemplated by the Bring-Along Notice) of all liabilities for the representations, warranties and other obligations incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Bring-Along Notice (other than with respect to representations and warranties relating to the ownership of such Executive Stockholder’s Securities or otherwise relating solely to such Executive Stockholder). 

^^At the closing of the Transfer to any Third Party Purchaser(s) pursuant to this Section 4, the Third Party Purchaser(s) shall remit to each Executive Stockholder (i) the consideration (as reduced by Section 4(g)) for the Securities held by such Executive Stockholder and being sold pursuant hereto, minus (ii) such Executive Stockholder’s pro rata portion of any consideration to be placed in escrow or otherwise held back in accordance with the Third Party Terms, minus (iii) the aggregate exercise price of any Company Options being Transferred by such Executive Stockholder to such Third Party Purchaser(s), against transfer of such Securities, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, by delivery by such Executive Stockholder of (A) certificates for such Securities, duly endorsed for Transfer or with duly executed stock powers reasonably acceptable to the Company and such Third Party Purchaser(s) and/or (B) an instrument evidencing the Transfer or the cancellation of the Company Options subject to the Bring-Along Right reasonably acceptable to the Company and such Third Party Purchaser(s), 

^^^^^ 
and the compliance by such Executive Stockholder with any other conditions to closing or payment of consideration generally applicable to the Carlyle Stockholders and all other Stockholders selling Securities in such transaction. In the event that the proposed Transfer to such Third Party Purchaser is not consummated, the Bring-Along Right shall continue to be applicable to any proposed subsequent Transfer of Securities by the Carlyle Stockholders pursuant to this Section 4. 

^^In the event that any Carlyle Stockholders exercise their rights pursuant to this Section 4 or a Company Sale is approved by the Board and the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Voting Shares, each Executive Stockholder shall consent to and raise no objections against such transaction, and shall take all actions that the Board and/or the applicable Carlyle Stockholders reasonably deem necessary or desirable in connection with the consummation of such transaction; provided, that (x) the acquisition of the Securities held by each Executive Stockholder in connection with such transaction shall be on the Same Terms and Conditions as the acquisition of the Securities held by the Carlyle Stockholders in connection with such transaction and (y) no Executive Stockholder shall be required to bear more than such Executive Stockholder’s pro rata share (determined based on the number of Securities sold in connection with such Company Sale) of all liabilities of the Stockholders for the representations, warranties and other obligations incurred in connection with such Company Sale (other than with respect to representations and warranties relating to the ownership of such Executive Stockholder’s Securities or otherwise relating solely to such Executive Stockholder). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Executive Stockholder agrees, subject to the foregoing proviso, that it shall (i) consent to and raise no objections against such transaction; (ii) execute any purchase agreement, merger agreement or other agreement in connection with such transaction setting forth the terms and conditions of such transaction and any ancillary agreement with respect thereto; (iii) vote any Voting Shares held by such Executive Stockholder in favor of such transaction (including, without limitation, executing a written consent of stockholders approving such transaction); and (iv) refrain from the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to such transaction. 

^^If the Company or the holders of the Company’s securities enter into any transaction for which Rule 506 (or any similar rule then in effect) promulgated under the Securities Act may be available (including, without limitation, a merger, consolidation or other reorganization), each Executive Stockholder shall, if requested by the Company, appoint a purchaser representative (as such term is defined in Rule 501 of the Securities Act) reasonably acceptable to the Company. If such purchaser representative was designated by the Company, the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such purchaser representative, but if any Individual Stockholder appoints another purchaser representative, such Individual Stockholder shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of the purchaser representative so appointed. 

^^Each Stockholder shall bear its pro rata share of the fees, costs and expenses of any Company Sale or other transaction (pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise) in which it sells Securities. 

^^^^^ 

Section 5.    Permitted Transfers.

^^Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the restrictions set forth in the first sentence of Section 2 shall not apply to: (i) any Transfer of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Common Stock or Company Non-Voting Common Stock by an Individual Stockholder that is a natural person (or a trust or entity of the type described below) (A) by gift to, or for the benefit of, any member or members of his or her immediate family (which shall include any spouse, or any lineal ancestor or descendant, niece, nephew, adopted child or sibling of him or her or such spouse, niece, nephew or adopted child), (B) to a trust under which the distribution of the Securities may be made only by such Individual Stockholder and/or such Individual Stockholder’s immediate family or (C) to a partnership or limited liability company for the benefit of the immediate family of such Individual Stockholder and the partners or members of which are only such Individual Stockholder and such Individual Stockholder’s immediate family; (ii) any Transfer of such Securities by an Individual Stockholder that is a natural person to the heirs, executors or legatees of such Individual Stockholder by operation of law or court order upon the death or incapacity of such Individual Stockholder; or (iii) any Transfer of such Securities by an Individual Stockholder that is not a natural person to an Affiliate; provided, that such Affiliate does not engage in any Competitive Activity (each of the Transfers referenced in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above which is otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5 is referred to herein as a “Permitted Transfer”). Upon any Permitted Transfer of Company Common Stock, the transferor shall retain a proxy to vote the same or shall (x) exchange the same with the Company for a share of Company Non-Voting Common Stock and, if such transferor so chooses (y) purchase from the Company for its par value a share of Company Special Voting Stock and Transfer in such Permitted Transfer only the share of Company Non-Voting Common Stock. In all such cases the Company shall take all reasonable actions to cooperate with the transferee and promptly effectuate any required exchanges or other arrangements contemplated hereby. The recipient of any Securities pursuant to the foregoing shall be referred to herein as a “Permitted Transferee” and shall be deemed a “Management Stockholder”, an “Other Stockholder”, or an “Executive Stockholder”, as the case may be, for all purposes of this Agreement. 

^^Each Individual Stockholder shall give the Company at least twenty (20) days’ prior written notice of any proposed Transfer pursuant to Section 5(a) above and prompt notice of any such actual Transfer. 

Section 6.    Registration Rights

^^At any time, the Carlyle Stockholders may request in writing that the Company effect the registration of all or any part of the Registrable Securities held by the Carlyle Stockholders in an underwritten public offering (a “Registration Request”). The Company will use its best efforts to register, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, all Registrable Securities that have been requested to be registered by the Carlyle Stockholders in the Registration Request; provided, that (i) managing underwriters’ estimate of the aggregate offering price of the Securities requested to be included in such Registration is at least $[[USD Value 1: Number]] and (ii) the Company shall not be required to register Registrable Securities during 

^^^^^ 
the period starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Company’s estimated date of filing of, and ending on a date one hundred and eighty (180) days after the effective date of, a registration initiated by the Company; provided that (x) in the case of a Registration Request received by the Company prior to the filing by the Company of such registration, the Company had been in good faith planning to file a registration statement within sixty (60) days of the Company’s receipt of such Registration Request and (y) the Company is actively employing in good faith all reasonable efforts to cause the applicable registration statement to become effective and that the Company’s estimate of the date of filing such registration statement is made in good faith. Any registration requested by the Carlyle Stockholders pursuant to this Section 6(a) is referred to in this Agreement as a “Demand Registration”. In connection with a Demand Registration, the Company shall have the right to select the underwriters to administer the offering, subject to the reasonable approval of the Carlyle Stockholders. 

^^If the Company at any time proposes to register any shares of Company Common Stock under the Securities Act (including pursuant to a Registration Request), whether or not for sale for its own account (other than pursuant to a Special Registration) and the registration form to be used may also be used for the registration of Registrable Securities owned by the Stockholders, the Company shall notify the Stockholders at least twenty (20) days prior to the planned effective date of the registration statement in connection therewith. Upon the receipt of a written request of any Stockholder made within ten (10) days after such notice (which request shall specify the Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Stockholder and the intended method of disposition thereof), the Company will, subject to the other provisions of this Section 6, include in such registration all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received a written request for inclusion (a “Piggyback Registration”). Each such request shall also contain an undertaking from the applicable Stockholder to provide all such information and material and to take all actions as may be reasonably required by the Company in order to permit the Company to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws. 

^^Each selling Stockholder shall pay all sales commissions or other similar selling charges with respect to Registrable Securities sold by such Stockholder pursuant to a Piggyback Registration. The Company shall pay all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with federal and state securities laws, printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel and accountants for the Company in connection with any registration, including, without limitation, a Demand Registration, unless the applicable state securities laws require that stockholders whose securities are being registered pay their pro rata share of such fees, expenses and disbursements, in which case each Stockholder participating in the registration shall pay its pro rata share of all such fees, expenses and disbursements based on its pro rata share of the total number of shares being registered. 

^^If a Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration is an underwritten registration, only Registrable Securities which are to be distributed by the underwriters may be included in the registration. If the managing underwriters or, if the Demand Registration or the Piggyback Registration is not an underwritten registration, the Company’s investment bankers, advise the Company that in their opinion the number of Securities requested to be included in 

^^^^^ 
such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering or will have a material adverse effect on the price of the Registrable Securities to be sold, the Company will include in such registration or prospectus only such number of Securities that in the reasonable opinion of such underwriters or investment bankers can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability or price of the offering, which securities will be so included in the following order of priority: (i) for registrations pursuant to Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) in connection with Demand Registrations, first, Registrable Securities of the Stockholders who have requested registration of their Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 6(a) or Section 6(b), pro rata on the basis of the aggregate number of such Registrable Securities proposed to be registered by such Stockholders, second, any Securities proposed to be registered by the Company; and (ii) for registrations pursuant to Section 6(b) (other than in connection with Demand Registrations, which are addressed in clause (i)), first, Securities proposed to be registered by the Company, and second, Registrable Securities of the Stockholders who have requested registration of their Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 6(b), pro rata on the basis of the aggregate number of such Registrable Securities proposed to be registered by such Stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriters or, if the registration is not an underwritten registration, the Company’s investment bankers, advise the Company that in their opinion, the inclusion in a Demand Registration or a Piggyback Registration of Registrable Securities held by the Management Stockholders will have a material adverse effect on the offering, then to the extent a greater reduction in the participation by Management Stockholders is approved in writing by at least two Senior Officers, the Company may reduce such Management Stockholder participation in such relatively greater proportion. 

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time after giving written notice to the Stockholders of its intention to register any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 6(b) (other than Demand Registrations) and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company shall determine in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement not to register such securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each Stockholder and thereupon shall be relieved of its obligation to register Registrable Securities as part of such terminated registration (but not from its obligation to pay expenses in connection therewith as provided in Section 6(c) above). Similarly, notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time after giving written notice to the Company of its Registration Request pursuant to Section 6(a) and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the applicable Carlyle Stockholders shall determine in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement not to register such securities, the applicable Carlyle Stockholders may, at their election, give written notice of such determination to the Company (which, in turn shall give written notice to each Individual Stockholder) and thereupon the applicable Carlyle Stockholders and the Company shall be relieved of their respective obligations to register Registrable Securities as part of such terminated registration (but the Company shall not be relieved from its obligation to pay expenses in connection therewith as provided in Section 6(c)). If a registration pursuant to this Section 6 involves an underwritten public offering or Individual Stockholder requests to be included in such registration, such Individual Stockholder may elect, in writing prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, not to participate in such registration. 

^^^^^ 
^^Except as part of the applicable registered offering, each Stockholder agrees not to sell or offer for public sale or distribution, including pursuant to Rule 144, any of such Stockholder’s Registrable Securities within fifteen (15) days prior to or one-hundred and eighty (180) days (or such shorter or longer period as determined by the underwriters and the Company to be appropriate) after the effective date of any registration (other than a Special Registration) with respect to which registration rights are available pursuant to this Section 6. 

^^The procedures to be used by the Company in effecting the registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 6 and the rights of any holder of Registrable Securities shall be those customary for demand registrations and piggyback registrations and shall be subject to (i) without limitation of such Stockholder’s obligations under Section 6(a) or Section 6(b), the Company’s right to request customary undertakings on the part of the sellers of any Registrable Securities with respect to holdbacks and the furnishing of such information for inclusion in any Registration Statement to be used in connection with such sale as is customarily provided by selling stockholders, and (ii) in connection with any underwritten offering which includes Registrable Securities held by any Stockholder to be registered pursuant to this Section 6, the execution by such Stockholder of a customary underwriting agreement with the underwriters for such offering. 

Section 7.    Indemnification.

^^The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each Stockholder participating in a registration pursuant to this Agreement, the officers and directors of such Stockholder and each Person that controls such Stockholder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, including, without limitation, all reasonable legal fees, incurred in connection therewith, arising out of, based upon or resulting from (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus, or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, (ii) any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of any federal, state, foreign or common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to action required of or inaction by the Company in connection with any such registration, except, in each case, insofar as it is judicially determined that the liability resulted from information furnished in writing to the Company by such Stockholder and stated by the Stockholder to be used therein or, in the case of an underwritten offering only, from such Stockholder’s failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto. 

^^Each Stockholder participating in a registration pursuant to this Agreement agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors and officers and each Person that controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act) the Company against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, including, without limitation, all reasonable legal fees, incurred in connection therewith, arising out of, based upon or resulting from (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained 

^^^^^ 
in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus, or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, but only to the extent that such untrue statement is contained in or (as to the matters set forth in such information or affidavit) such omission is omitted from any information or affidavit furnished to the Company in writing by such Stockholder and stated to be expressly for use therein; provided, that such Stockholder’s obligations hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds to such Stockholder of the Registrable Securities sold pursuant to such registration statement. 

^^In connection with an underwritten offering, the Company and each Stockholder participating in the related registration will indemnify the underwriter(s), their officers and directors and each Person who controls such underwriter(s) (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in this Section 7. 

^^Any Person entitled to indemnification under this Section 7 shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) unless in such indemnified party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. 

^^The indemnification provided for under this Agreement will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such indemnified party and will survive the registration and sale of any securities by any Person entitled to any indemnification hereunder and the expiration or termination of this Agreement. 

^^If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relevant fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue 

^^^^^ 
statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount any Stockholder will be obligated to contribute pursuant to this Section 7(f) will be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds to such Stockholder of the Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the registration statement which gives rise to such obligation to contribute (less the aggregate amount of any damages which the Stockholder has otherwise been required to pay in respect of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action or any substantially similar loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising from the sale of such Registrable Securities). 

Section 8.    Rights to Repurchase Securities held by Management Stockholders.

^^During the period beginning on the date of a Termination of Service of a Management Stockholder, and ending on the date nine (9) months following the later of (i) the date of such Termination of Service, (ii) the date of the exercise of any vested Company Options held by such Management Stockholder and (iii) the date that the Company becomes aware that a Management Stockholder has since the date of this Agreement engaged in or is engaging in Competitive Activity, the Company shall have the option to repurchase the Securities issued pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan (or any similar equity-based plans approved by the Board, other than the Company Rollover Stock Plan (which contains provisions applicable to the Securities to which it relates)) held by such terminated Management Stockholder and/or his Related Trusts and Permitted Transferees (collectively, the “Management Securities Call Right”). The Management Securities Call Right may be exercised more than once. The Management Securities Call Right shall be exercised by written notice (the “Management Securities Call Notice”) to such Management Stockholder given in accordance with Section 16(f) below on or prior to the last day on which the Management Securities Call Right may be exercised by the Company.

^^^^^ 
legally available to make such payment under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (each such event in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), a “Repurchase Disability”); provided, that (x) the Company shall notify in writing the Management Stockholder with respect to whom the repurchase right has been exercised (a “Disability Notice”) and (y) the Disability Notice shall specify the nature of the Repurchase Disability. If a repurchase by the Company otherwise permitted under this Section 8 is prevented by a Repurchase Disability: (i) the purchase and payment of the applicable purchase price shall be postponed and will take place at the first opportunity thereafter when the Company has funds legally available to make such payment and when such payment will not result in any default, event of default or violation under any of the Financing Agreements or in a violation of any term or provision of the certificate of incorporation of the Company, (ii) such repurchase obligation shall rank against other similar repurchase obligations with respect to Securities according to priority in time of the termination date giving rise to such repurchase (provided that any repurchase commitment arising from a termination of employment because of Disability or death shall have priority over any other repurchase obligation) and (iii) the applicable purchase price (except in the case of a termination for Cause) shall be either, in the Company’s discretion, as determined on the date the Company exercises its repurchase right, (i) increased by an amount equal to interest on such purchase price for the period during which payment is delayed at the market interest rate determined by the Company or (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Securities as of the date that the Repurchase Disability ceases to be applicable; provided, however, that if the Company has not repurchased Securities pursuant to this Section 8 within four years following the delivery of a Disability Notice, the Company shall thereafter have no right or obligation to repurchase such Securities. 

^^If a Management Stockholder’s employment with the Company is terminated other than (x) by the Company without Cause, (y) by reason of the Management Stockholder’s death or Disability or (z) in a Company Approved Termination, the Company shall have the option, for so long as it has a Management Securities Call Right with respect to such Management Stockholder, either in lieu of exercising such Management Securities Call Right or upon or following such exercise if a Repurchase Disability has occurred and is continuing, (i) to convert such Management Stockholder’s Company Common Stock to Company Non-Voting Common Stock and (ii) to purchase each share of Company Special Voting Stock held by such Management Stockholder from such Management Stockholder for a purchase price equal to par value of such share. The Company’s rights under this Section 8(e) shall be exercised by written notice to such Management Stockholder given in accordance with Section 16(f ) on or prior to the last day on which the Management Securities Call right may be exercised by the Company.

For purposes of determining 

^^^^^ 
whether any of the Payments would not be deductible as a result of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code and the amount of such disallowed deduction or excise tax, all Payments will be treated as “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and all “parachute payments” in excess of the “base amount” (as defined under Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as nondeductible and subject to the excise tax, unless and except to the extent that in the opinion of a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Company (the “Accountants”), such Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute “parachute payments,” including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code, or are otherwise not subject to disallowance as a deduction or not subject to the excise tax. All determinations required to be made under this Section 12(a), including whether and which of the Payments are required to be reduced, the amount of such reduction and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall be made by the Accountants, provided, however, that such determinations shall be based upon “substantial authority” within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code. 

^^Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of Section 12(a) above shall not apply to reduce the Payments if (i) the Payments that would otherwise be nondeductible under Section 280G of the Code or subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code are disclosed to and approved by the Stockholders in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulation codified at 26 C.F.R. § 1.280G-1 (the “280G Regulations”), (ii) immediately before the change in ownership or control the Company does not meet the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii)(I) and the 280G Regulations, (iii) the Company fails to comply with Section 12(c) or (iv) prior to the earlier of (A) the applicable change in ownership or control and (B) the stockholder meeting called by the Company pursuant to Section 12(c), the Unaffiliated Directors, acting at the request of either Executive Director and taking into account all relevant considerations, including the rights of the Management Stockholders, determines that the provisions of Section 12(a) shall not apply to such Payments. 

^^The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to prepare and deliver to the Stockholders the disclosure required by Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code with respect to the Payments and to obtain the approval of the Stockholders in accordance with to Section 12(b) above prior to the applicable change in ownership or control.
