^^Mandatory. (i) If Borrower shall at any time or from time to time make or agree to make a Disposition or shall suffer an Event of Loss with respect to any Property, then Borrower shall promptly notify Bank of such proposed Disposition or Event of Loss (including the amount of the estimated Net Cash Proceeds to be received by Borrower in respect thereof) and, promptly upon receipt by Borrower of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Disposition or Event of Loss, Borrower shall prepay the Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of the amount of all such Net Cash Proceeds; provided that (x) so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, this subsection shall not require any such prepayment with respect to Net Cash Proceeds received on account of an Event of Loss so long as such Net Cash Proceeds are applied to replace or restore the relevant Property in accordance with the relevant Collateral Documents, (y) this subsection shall not require any such prepayment with respect to Net Cash Proceeds received on account of Dispositions during any fiscal year of Borrower not exceeding $[[USD Value 9: Number]] in the aggregate so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, and (z) in the case of any Disposition not covered by clause (y) above, so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, if Borrower states in its notice of such event that Borrower intends to reinvest, within 90 days of the applicable Disposition, the Net Cash Proceeds thereof in assets similar to the assets which were subject to such Disposition, then Borrower shall not be required to make a mandatory prepayment under this subsection in respect of such Net Cash Proceeds to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds are actually reinvested in such similar assets with such 90-day period. Promptly after the end of such 90-dayperiod, Borrower shall notify Bank whether Borrower has reinvested such Net Cash Proceeds in such similar assets, and, to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds have not been so reinvested, Borrower shall promptly prepay the Obligations in the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so reinvested.

If Bank so request, all proceeds of such Disposition or Event of Loss shall be deposited with Bank (or its agent) and held by it in a collateral account for the benefit of Bank (the “Collateral Account”).

Borrower acknowledges that its performance hereunder shall not limit the rights and remedies of Bank for any breach of Section 6.7 hereof or any other terms of the Loan Documents.

^Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy; Funding Exceptions.

^^Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy. If Bank determines at any time that its Return (as defined below) has been reduced as a result of any Rule Change (as defined below), Bank may so notify Borrower and require Borrower, beginning thirty (30) days after such notice is received by Borrower, to pay it the amount necessary to restore its Return to what it would have been had there been no Rule Change. For purposes of this Section 2.6:

^^^“Capital Adequacy Rule” means any law, rule, regulation, guideline, directive, requirement or request regarding capital adequacy, or the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, whether or not having the force of law, that applies to any Related Bank (as defined below), including rules requiring financial institutions to maintain total capital in amounts based upon percentages of outstanding loans, binding loan commitments and letters of credit.

^^^“Related Bank” includes (but is not limited to) Bank, any parent of Bank and any assignee of any interest of Bank hereunder.

^^^“Return”, for any period, means the percentage determined by dividing (i) the sum of interest and ongoing fees earned by Bank under this Agreement during such period, by (ii) the average capital such Bank is required to maintain during such period as a result of its being a party to this Agreement, as determined by Bank based upon its total capital requirements and a reasonable attribution formula that takes account of the Capital Adequacy Rules then in effect, costs of issuing or maintaining the Loan and amounts received or receivable under this Agreement or the Note with respect to the Loan. Return may be calculated for each calendar quarter and for the shorter period between the end of a calendar quarter and the date of termination in whole of this Agreement.

^^“Rule Change” means any change in any Capital Adequacy Rule occurring after the date of this Agreement, but the term does not include any changes that at the Closing Date are scheduled to take place under the existing Capital Adequacy Rules or any increases in the capital that Bank is required to maintain to the extent that the increases are required due to a regulatory authority’s assessment of that Bank’s financial condition.

^^The initial notice sent by Bank shall be sent as promptly as practicable after Bank learns that its Return has been reduced, shall include a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore Bank’s Return for the subsequent quarter in which the notice is sent, and shall state in reasonable detail the cause for the reduction in its Return and its calculation of the amount of such reduction. Thereafter, Bank may send a new notice during each calendar quarter setting forth the calculation of the reduced Return for that quarter and including a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore its Return for that quarter. Bank’s calculation in any such notice shall be prima facie evidence of such amount.

^^Borrower shall not be required to compensate Bank pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.6 for any reduction of its Return suffered more than 90 days prior to the date that Bank notifies Borrower of the Rule Change giving rise to such reduction and of Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefore; provided, that any Rule Change that is applied retroactively shall be applied retroactively, then the 90 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect hereof.

^Liability Records. Bank may maintain from time to time, at its discretion, records as to the Obligations. All entries made on any such record shall be presumed correct until Borrower establishes the contrary. Upon Bank’s demand, Borrower will admit and certify in writing the exact principal balance of the Obligations that Borrower then asserts to be outstanding. Any billing statement or accounting rendered by Bank shall be conclusive and fully binding on Borrower unless Borrower gives Bank specific written notice of exception within 30 days after receipt.

\centered **Security Interest; Guaranties**

^Guaranties The payment and performance of the Obligations shall at all times be guaranteed by Parent, Holdings and each direct and indirect Subsidiary of Parent (Parent, Holdings and such Subsidiaries shall be collectively referred to herein as the “Guarantors”) pursuant to one or more guaranty agreements in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Bank, as the same may be amended, modified, or supplemented from time to time (individually a “Guaranty” and collectively the “Guaranties”). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, (i) Parent shall be permitted to sell its interest in Landec AG or Cal Ex, and/or (ii) Parent in its reasonable business judgment shall be permitted to authorize Landec AG and/or Cal Ex to wind down, dissolve or ortherwise terminate its existence (and any such wind down, dissolution or termination shall not constitute an Event of Default hereunder), in each case without any prior approval or consent of Bank.

^Grant of Security Interest. Borrower hereby pledges, assigns and grants to Bank a Lien and security interest (collectively referred to as the “Security Interest”) in the Collateral, as security for the payment and performance of the Obligations. Upon request by Bank, Borrower will grant Bank a security interest in all commercial tort claims it may have against any Person.

All of the foregoing shall be evidenced by and subject to the terms of such security agreements, financing statements and other documents as Bank shall reasonably require, all in form and substance satisfactory to Bank (including, without limitation, the Security Documents). Borrower shall reimburse Bank within fifteen (15) days after written demand for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Bank in connection with any of the foregoing security, including without limitation, filing and recording fees and costs of appraisals and audits.

A carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement or of any financing statements authorized by Borrower is sufficient as a financing statement and may be filed as a financing statement in any state to perfect the security interests granted hereby.

^^without notice to or demand upon Borrower or any Guarantor, Bank may make such payments and do such acts as Bank considers necessary or reasonable to protect its security interests in the Collateral. Borrower agrees to assemble the Collateral if Bank so requires, and to make the Collateral available to Bank at a place that Bank may designate which is reasonably convenient to both parties. Borrower authorizes Bank to enter the premises where the Collateral is located, to take and maintain possession of the Collateral, or any part of it, and to pay, purchase, contest, or compromise any Lien that in Bank’s determination appears to conflict with Bank’s Liens and to pay all expenses incurred in connection therewith and to charge the Obligations therefor. With respect to any of Borrower’s owned or leased premises, Borrower hereby grants Bank a license to enter into possession of such premises and to occupy the same, without charge, in order to exercise any of Bank’s rights or remedies provided herein, at law, in equity, or otherwise;

^^without notice to Borrower (such notice being expressly waived), and without constituting a retention of any collateral in satisfaction of an obligation (within the meaning of the UCC), Bank may set off and apply to the Obligations any and all (i) balances and deposits of Borrower held by Bank (including any amounts received in the Lockbox), or (ii) Indebtedness at any time owing to or for the credit or the account of Borrower held by Bank;

^^Bank may hold, as cash collateral, any and all balances and deposits of Borrower held by Bank, and any amounts received in the Lockbox, to secure the full and final repayment of all of the Obligations;

^^Bank may sell the Collateral at either a public or private sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or transactions, for cash or on terms, in such manner and at such places (including Borrower’s premises) as Bank determines is commercially reasonable. It is not necessary that the Collateral be present at any such sale;

^^Bank shall give notice of the disposition of the Collateral as follows:

^^^Bank shall give Borrower a notice in writing of the time and place of public sale, or, if the sale is a private sale or some other disposition other than a public sale is to be made of the Collateral, the time on or after which the private sale or other disposition is to be made; and

^^^The notice shall be personally delivered or mailed, postage prepaid, to Borrower as provided in Section 8.3, at least 10 days before the earliest time of disposition set forth in the notice; no notice needs to be given prior to the disposition of any portion of the Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or that is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market;

^^Bank may credit bid and purchase at any public sale;

^^Bank may seek the appointment of a receiver or keeper to take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral or to operate the same and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, may seek the appointment of such a receiver without the requirement of prior notice or a hearing;

^^If Bank sells any of the Collateral on credit, the Obligations will be reduced only to the extent of payments actually received. If the purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral, Bank may resell the Collateral and shall apply any proceeds actually received to the Obligations;

^^Bank shall have no obligation to attempt to satisfy the Obligations by collecting them from any third Person which may be liable for them or any portion thereof, and Bank may release, modify or waive any collateral provided by any other Person as security for the Obligations or any portion thereof, all without affecting Bank’s rights against Borrower. Borrower waives any right it may have to require Bank to pursue any third Person for any of the Obligations;

^^Bank may make demand upon Borrower and, forthwith upon such demand, Borrower will pay to Bank in immediately available funds for deposit in the Special Account an amount equal to the aggregate maximum amount available to be drawn under all Letters of Credit then outstanding, assuming compliance with all conditions for drawing thereunder;

^^Bank may exercise and enforce its rights and remedies under the Loan Documents; and

^^Bank may exercise any other rights and remedies available to it by law or agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in subsections (d) or (e) of Section 7.1, the Obligations shall be immediately due and payable automatically without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind.

^Disclaimer of Warranties. Bank may sell the Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Collateral. Bank may specifically disclaim any warranties of title or the like. This procedure will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.

^Compliance With Laws. Bank may comply with any applicable state or federal law requirements in connection with a disposition of the Collateral, and Bank’s compliance therewith will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.

^No Marshalling. Bank shall be under no obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Borrower, or against or in payment of the Obligations or any other obligation owned to Bank by Borrower or any other Person.

^Borrower to Cooperate. Upon the exercise by Bank of any power, right, privilege, or remedy pursuant to this Agreement which requires any consent, approval, registration, qualification, or authorization of any Governmental Authority, Borrower agrees to execute and deliver, or will cause the execution and delivery of, all applications, certificates, instruments, assignments, and other documents and papers that Bank or any purchaser of the Collateral may be required to obtain for such governmental consent, approval, registration, qualification, or authorization.

^Application of Proceeds. All proceeds realized as the result of any sale of the Collateral shall be applied by Bank:

FIRST to the costs, expenses, liabilities, obligations and attorneys’ fees incurred by Bank in the exercise of its rights under this Agreement;

SECOND to the interest and fees due upon any of the Obligations; and

THIRD to the principal of the Obligations and to cash collateralize the Bond L/C by an amount not less than [[Percentage 5]]% of the obligations arising under or pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement, in such order as Bank shall determine in its sole discretion. Any surplus shall be paid to Borrower or other Persons legally entitled thereto; Borrower shall remain liable to Bank for any deficiency.

^Remedies Cumulative. The rights and remedies of Bank under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and all other agreements contemplated hereby and thereby shall be cumulative. Bank shall have all other rights and remedies not inconsistent herewith as provided under the UCC, by law, or in equity. No exercise by Bank of any one right or remedy shall be deemed an election of remedies, and no waiver by Bank of any default on Borrower’s part shall be deemed a continuing waiver of any further defaults.

^Bank Not Liable For The Collateral. So long as Bank complies with the obligations, if any, imposed by the UCC, Bank shall not otherwise be liable or responsible in any way or manner for: (a) the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b) any loss or damage thereto occurring or arising in any manner or fashion or from any cause; (c) any diminution in the value thereof; or (d) any act or default of any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, forwarding agency, or other person whomsoever, in each case, other than arising as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Bank. Borrower bears the risk of loss or damage of the Collateral.

\centered **Miscellaneous**

^No Waiver. No failure or delay by Bank in exercising any right, power or remedy under the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy under the Loan Documents.

^Amendments, Etc. No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom or any release of a Security Interest shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Bank, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on Borrower in any case shall entitle Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

^Addresses for Notices; Requests for Accounting. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices, requests, demands and other communications provided for under the Loan Documents shall be in writing and shall be (a) personally delivered, (b) sent by first class United States mail, (c) sent by overnight courier of national reputation, or (d) transmitted by telecopy, in each case addressed or telecopied to the party to whom notice is being given at its address or telecopier number as set forth below next to its signature or, as to each party, at such other address or telecopier number as may hereafter be designated by such party in a written notice to the other party complying as to delivery with the terms of this Section. All such notices, requests, demands and other communications shall be deemed to have been given on (a) the date received if personally delivered, (b) when deposited in the mail if delivered by mail, (c) the date sent if sent by overnight courier, or (d) the date of transmission if delivered by telecopy, except that notices or requests to Bank pursuant to any of the provisions of Article II shall not be effective until received by Bank. All requests under Section 9210 of the UCC (i) shall be made in a writing signed by a person authorized under Section 2.1(d), (ii) shall be personally delivered, sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by overnight courier of national reputation (iii) shall be deemed to be sent when received by Bank and (iv) shall otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 9210. Borrower requests that Bank respond to each such request which on its face appears to come from an authorized individual and releases Bank from any liability for so responding. Borrower shall pay Bank the maximum amount allowed by law for responding to such requests.

^Further Documents. Borrower will from time to time execute and deliver or endorse any and all instruments, documents, conveyances, assignments, security agreements, financing statements, control agreements and other agreements and writings that Bank may reasonably request in order to secure, protect, perfect or enforce the Security Interest or Bank’s rights under the Loan Documents (but any failure to request or assure that Borrower executes, delivers or endorses any such item shall not affect or impair the validity, sufficiency or enforceability of the Loan Documents and the Security Interest, regardless of whether any such item was or was not executed, delivered or endorsed in a similar context or on a prior occasion).

^Costs and Expenses. Borrower shall pay within fifteen (15) days after written demand all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses relating to a survey, an environmental report, and an appraisal report, incurred by Bank in connection with the Obligations, this Agreement, the Loan Documents, and any other document or agreement related hereto or thereto, and the transactions contemplated hereby, including all such costs, expenses and fees incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, amendment, administration, performance, collection and enforcement of the Obligations and all such documents and agreements and the creation, perfection, protection, satisfaction, foreclosure or enforcement of the Security Interest.

^Indemnity. In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to Section 8.5, Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Bank, and any of its participants, parent corporations, subsidiary corporations, affiliated corporations, successor corporations, and all present and future officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents of the foregoing (the “Indemnitees”) from and against any of the following (collectively, “Indemnified Liabilities”), in each, other than arising as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Indemnitee:

^^^any and all transfer taxes, documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any Governmental Authority by reason of the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents or the making of the Loan;

^^^any claims, loss or damage to which any Indemnitee may be subjected if any representation or warranty contained in Section 5.14 proves to be incorrect in any respect or as a result of any violation of the covenant contained in Section 6.13(b); and

^^^any and all other liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, judgments, suits, claims, costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) in connection with the foregoing and any other investigative, administrative or judicial proceedings, whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto, which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee, in any manner related to or arising out of or in connection with the Credit Facility and the Loan Documents or the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Line of Credit.

If any investigative, judicial or administrative proceeding arising from any of the foregoing is brought against any Indemnitee, upon such Indemnitee’s request, Borrower, or counsel designated by Borrower and satisfactory to the Indemnitee, will resist and defend such action, suit or proceeding to the extent and in the manner directed by the Indemnitee, at Borrower’s sole costs and expense. Each Indemnitee will use its best efforts to cooperate in the defense of any such action, suit or proceeding. If the foregoing undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold harmless may be held to be unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall nevertheless make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law. Borrower’s obligation under this Section 8.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the discharge of Borrower’s other obligations hereunder.

^Participants. Borrower hereby authorizes Bank to disclose to any assigneeor any participant (either, a “Transferee”) and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in Bank’s possession concerning Borrower which has been delivered to Bank by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to Bank by Borrower in connection with Bank’s credit evaluation prior to entering into this Agreement. Bank and its participants, if any, are not partners or joint venturers, and Bank shall not have any liability or responsibility for any obligation, act or omission of any of its participants. All rights and powers specifically conferred upon Bank may be transferred or delegated to any of Bank’s participants, successors or assigns.

^Advertising and Promotion. Borrower agrees that Bank may use Borrower’s name in advertising and promotional materials, and in conjunction therewith, Bank may disclose the amount of the Credit Facility and the purpose thereof, only upon the express consent of Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

^Execution in Counterparts; Telefacsimile Execution. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile also shall deliver an original executed counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of this Agreement.

^Retention of Borrower’s Records. Bank shall have no obligation to maintain any electronic records or any documents, schedules, invoices, or other papers delivered to Bank by Borrower or in connection with the Loan Documents for more than twelve months after receipt by Bank; provided that Borrower shall not have any obligation to provide Bank with duplicate records and documents after the same have been destroyed by Bank.

^Binding Effect; Assignment; Complete Agreement; Exchanging Information. The Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower and Bank and their respective successors and assigns, except that Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights thereunder or any interest therein without Bank’s prior written consent. Bank shall not assign any of its rights and obligations arising under this Agreement or the Note without the prior written consent of Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower’s consent to any such assignment shall not be required (i) if a Default Period has occurred and is continuing, (ii) if Bank assigns this Agreement in connection with any sale or all or any portion of its loan portfolio, (iii) if Bank assigns this Agreement to any Affiliate of Bank, or (iv) Bank may pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of this Agreement to secure its obligations, including any such pledge or grant to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such grant or pledge; provided, that no such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or secured party for Bank as party hereto. To the extent permitted by law, Borrower waives and will not assert against any assignee any claims, defenses or set-offs which Borrower could assert against Bank. This Agreement shall also bind all Persons who become a party to this Agreement as Borrower. This Agreement, together with the Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on the subject matter hereof. Without limiting Bank’s right to share information regarding Borrower and its Affiliates with Bank’s participants, accountants, lawyers and other advisors, Bank, Wells Fargo & Company, and all direct and indirect subsidiaries of Wells Fargo & Company, may exchange any and all information they may have in their possession regarding Borrower and its Affiliates, and Borrower waives any right of confidentiality it may have with respect to such exchange of such information.

^Severability of Provisions. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof.

^Revival and Reinstatement of Obligations. If the incurrence or payment of the Obligations by Borrower or any Guarantor or the transfer to Bank of any property should for any reason subsequently be declared to be void or voidable under any state or federal law relating to creditors’ rights, including provisions of Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable payments of money or transfers of property (collectively, a “Voidable Transfer”), and if Bank is required to repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the reasonable advice of its counsel, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that Bank is required or elects to repay or restore, and as to all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys fees of Bank related thereto, the liability of Borrower or any Guarantor automatically shall be revived, reinstated, and restored and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer had never been made.

^Headings. Article, Section and subsection headings in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

^***Submission to Jurisdiction***. **Subject to Section 8.17: (i) any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be brought solely in the courts of the state of California or of the United States for the Northern District of California, and, by execution and delivery hereof, each of Borrower and Bank consents, for itself and in respect of its property, to the jurisdiction of those courts; (ii) each of Borrower and Bank irrevocably waives any objection, including any objection to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any action or proceeding in such jurisdiction in respect of this agreement or any document related hereto. Each of Borrower and Bank waives personal service of any summons, complaint or other process, which may be made by any other means permitted by California law.**

^***Waiver of Jury Trial***. **Each of Borrower and Bank, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, hereby irrevocably waives all right to a trail by jury in any action, proceeding, counterclaim or other litigation in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any other of the Loan Documents or any of the transactions or events referenced herein or therein or contemplated hereby or thereby, whether with respect to contract claims, tort claims or otherwise. This waiver shall apply to any subsequent amendments, renewals, supplements or modifications to this Agreement or any other of the Loan Documents. A copy of this Section 8.17 may be filed with any court as written evidence of the waiver of the right to trial by jury and the consent to trial by court.**

^Arbitration. (a) Arbitration. The parties hereto agree, upon demand by any party, to submit to binding arbitration all claims, disputes and controversies between or among them (and their respective employees, officers, directors, attorneys, and other agents), whether in tort, contract or otherwise in any way arising out of or relating to (i) any credit subject hereto, or any of the Loan Documents, and their negotiation, execution, collateralization, administration, repayment, modification, extension, substitution, formation, inducement, enforcement, default or termination; or (ii) requests for additional credit.

^^Governing Rules. Any arbitration proceeding will (i) proceed in a location in California selected by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”); (ii) be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), notwithstanding any conflicting choice of law provision in any of the documents between the parties; and (iii) be conducted by the AAA, or such other administrator as the parties shall mutually agree upon, in accordance with the AAA’s commercial dispute resolution procedures, unless the claim or counterclaim is at least $[[USD Value 17: Number]] exclusive of claimed interest, arbitration fees and costs in which case the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA’s optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes (the commercial dispute resolution procedures or the optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes to be referred to herein, as applicable, as the “Rules”). If there is any inconsistency between the terms hereof and the Rules, the terms and procedures set forth herein shall control. Any party who fails or refuses to submit to arbitration following a demand by any other party shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by such other party in compelling arbitration of any dispute. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by any party that is a bank of the protections afforded to it under 12 U.S.C. §91 or any similar applicable state law.

^^No Waiver of Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure. The arbitration requirement does not limit the right of any party to (i) foreclose against the Collateral; (ii) exercise self-help remedies relating to Collateral or proceeds of Collateral such as setoff or repossession; or (iii) obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as replevin, injunctive relief, attachment or the appointment of a receiver, before during or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding. This exclusion does not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit any dispute to arbitration or reference hereunder, including those arising from the exercise of the actions detailed in sections (i), (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph.

^^Arbitrator Qualifications and Powers. Any arbitration proceeding in which the amount in controversy is $[[USD Value 18: Number]] or less will be decided by a single arbitrator selected according to the Rules, and who shall not render an award of greater than $[[USD Value 18]]. Any dispute in which the amount in controversy exceeds $[[USD Value 18]] shall be decided by majority vote of a panel of three arbitrators; provided however, that all three arbitrators must actively participate in all hearings and deliberations. The arbitrator will be a neutral attorney licensed in the State of California or a neutral retired judge of the state or federal judiciary of California, in either case with a minimum of ten years experience in the substantive law applicable to the subject matter of the dispute to be arbitrated. The arbitrator will determine whether or not an issue is arbitratable and will give effect to the statutes of limitation in determining any claim. In any arbitration proceeding the arbitrator will decide (by documents only or with a hearing at the arbitrator’s discretion) any pre-hearing motions which are similar to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or motions for summary adjudication. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes in accordance with the substantive law of California and may grant any remedy or relief that a court of such state could order or grant within the scope hereof and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any award. The arbitrator shall also have the power to award recovery of all costs and fees, to impose sanctions and to take such other action as the arbitrator deems necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the California Rules of Civil Procedure or other applicable law. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other party contests such action for judicial relief.

^^Discovery. In any arbitration proceeding, discovery will be permitted in accordance with the Rules. All discovery shall be expressly limited to matters directly relevant to the dispute being arbitrated and must be completed no later than 20 days before the hearing date. Any requests for an extension of the discovery periods, or any discovery disputes, will be subject to final determination by the arbitrator upon a showing that the request for discovery is essential for the party’s presentation and that no alternative means for obtaining information is available.

^^Class Proceedings and Consolidations. No party hereto shall be entitled to join or consolidate disputes by or against others in any arbitration, except parties who have executed any Loan Document, or to include in any arbitration any dispute as a representative or member of a class, or to act in any arbitration in the interest of the general public or in a private attorney general capacity.

^^Payment Of Arbitration Costs And Fees. The arbitrator shall award all costs and expenses of the arbitration proceeding.

^^Real Property Collateral; Judicial Reference. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no dispute shall be submitted to arbitration if the dispute concerns indebtedness secured directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by any real property unless (i) the holder of the mortgage, lien or security interest specifically elects in writing to proceed with the arbitration, or (ii) all parties to the arbitration waive any rights or benefits that might accrue to them by virtue of the single action rule statute of California, thereby agreeing that all indebtedness and obligations of the parties, and all mortgages, liens and security interests securing such indebtedness and obligations, shall remain fully valid and enforceable. If any such dispute is not submitted to arbitration, the dispute shall be referred to a referee in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Section 638 et seq., and this general reference agreement is intended to be specifically enforceable in accordance with said Section 638. A referee with the qualifications required herein for arbitrators shall be selected pursuant to the AAA’s selection procedures. Judgment upon the decision rendered by a referee shall be entered in the court in which such proceeding was commenced in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 644 and 645.

^^Miscellaneous. To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the arbitrators and the parties shall take all action required to conclude any arbitration proceeding within 180 days of the filing of the dispute with the AAA. No arbitrator or other party to an arbitration proceeding may disclose the existence, content or results thereof, except for disclosures of information by a party required in the ordinary course of its business or by applicable law or regulation. If more than one agreement for arbitration by or between the parties potentially applies to a dispute, the arbitration provision most directly related to the Loan Documents or the subject matter of the dispute shall control. This arbitration provision shall survive termination, amendment or expiration of any of the Loan Documents or any relationship between the parties.

^^Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party retains the right to pursue in Small Claims Court any dispute within that court’s jurisdiction. Further, this arbitration provision shall apply only to disputes in which either party seeks to recover an amount of money (excluding attorneys’ fees and costs) that exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims Court.

^Confidentiality. Except as set forth in Section 8.7 and Section 8.8 hereof, Bank shall hold all confidential non-public information obtained by Bank in accordance with Bank’s customary procedures for handling confidential information of this nature; provided that Bank may disclose such confidential information (i) to its examiners, Affiliates, outside auditors, counsel and other professional advisors on a need to know basis, (ii) to any prospective participant or transferee of Bank’s rights or obligations hereunder, provided such participant or transferee agrees, prior to the disclosure of such information by Bank, to be bound by the terms of this Section 8.19 with respect to such information and (iii) as required or requested by any Governmental Authority or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process; provided further that this duty shall expire if such information becomes publicly available through no breach of this Section 8.19 by Bank; provided further that unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, Bank shall use commercially reasonable efforts, prior to disclosure thereof, to notify Borrower of the request for disclosure of such non-public information (A) by a Governmental Authority or representative thereof or (B) pursuant to legal process. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Bank may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, any information with respect to the “tax treatment” and “tax structure” (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided Bank relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided that with respect to any document or similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby.

\centered TERM NOTE

$[[USD Value 8]]   Palo Alto, California

[[Date 1]]  
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned [[Borrower]], a Minnesota limited liability company (“Borrower”) promises to pay to the order of [[Bank]], NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“Bank”) at its office at [[Address 5: Address]], California, or at such other place as the holder hereof may designate, in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds, the principal sum of Twenty Million and No/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 8]]), with interest thereon as set forth herein.

DEFINITIONS:   
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement (as defined below). As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth after each, and any other term defined in this Note shall have the meaning set forth at the place defined:

^^“Business Day” means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which commercial banks in California are authorized or required by law to close.

^^“Credit Agreement” means that certain Credit Agreement dated as of even day herewith between Borrower and Bank, as the same may be amended, modified, restated or supplemented from time to time.

^^“Daily Three Month LIBOR” means, for any day, the rate of interest equal to LIBOR then in effect for delivery for a three (3) month period.

^^“Fixed Rate Term” means a period commencing on a Business Day and continuing for 1, 2, or 3 months, as designated by Borrower, during which all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance of this Note bears interest determined in relation to LIBOR; provided however, that no Fixed Rate Term may be selected for a principal amount less than Two Hundred Fifty and No/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 9]]); and provided further, that no Fixed Rate Term shall extend beyond the Term Loan Maturity Date. If any Fixed Rate Term would end on a day which is not a Business Day, then such Fixed Rate Term shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.

^^“LIBOR” means the rate per annum (rounded upward, if necessary, to the nearest whole 1/8 of [[Percentage 6: Number]]%) and determined pursuant to the following formula:

LIBOR =      Base LIBOR
[[Percentage 4]]% - LIBOR Reserve Percentage

^^^“Base LIBOR” means the rate per annum for United States dollar deposits quoted by Bank (A) for the purpose of calculating effective rates of interest for loans making reference to LIBOR, as the Inter-Bank Market Offered Rate, with the understanding that such rate is quoted by Bank for the purpose of calculating effective rates of interest for loans making reference thereto, on the first day of a Fixed Rate Term for delivery of funds on said date for a period of time approximately equal to the number of days in such Fixed Rate Term and in an amount approximately equal to the principal amount to which such Fixed Rate Term applies, or (B) for the purpose of calculating effective rates of interest for loans making reference to the Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate, as the Inter-Bank Market Offered Rate in effect from time to time for delivery of funds for three (3) month in amounts approximately equal to the principal amount of such loans. Borrower understands and agrees that Bank may base its quotation of the Inter-Bank Market Offered Rate upon such offers or other market indicators of the Inter-Bank Market as Bank in its discretion deems appropriate including, but not limited to, the rate offered for U.S. dollar deposits on the London Inter-Bank Market.

^^^“LIBOR Reserve Percentage” means the reserve percentage prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for “Eurocurrency Liabilities” (as defined in Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board, as amended), adjusted by Bank for expected changes in such reserve percentage during the applicable term of this Note.

INTEREST:   
^^**Interest**. The outstanding principal balance of this Note shall bear interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed) as selected by Borrower either (i) at a fluctuating rate per annum determined by Bank to be two percent ([[Percentage 7: Number]]%) above the Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate in effect from time to time, or (ii) at a fixed rate per annum determined by Bank to be two percent ([[Percentage 7]]%) above LIBOR in effect on the first day of the applicable Fixed Rate Term. When interest is determined in relation to the Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate, each change in the interest rate shall become effective each Business Day that Bank determines that the Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate has changed. Bank is hereby authorized to note the date, principal amount and interest rate applicable thereto and any payments made thereon on Bank’s books and records (either manually or by electronic entry) and/or on any schedule attached to this Note, which notations shall be prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information noted.

^^**Selection of Interest Rate Options**. At any time any portion of this Note bears interest determined in relation to LIBOR for a Fixed Rate Term, it may be continued by Borrower at the end of the Fixed Rate Term applicable thereto so that all or a portion thereof bears interest determined in relation to the Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate or to LIBOR for a new Fixed Rate Term designated by Borrower. At any time any portion of this Note bears interest determined in relation to the Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate, Borrower may at any time convert all or a portion thereof so that it bears interest determined in relation to LIBOR for a Fixed Rate Term designated by Borrower. At such time as Borrower requests an advance hereunder or wishes to select an interest rate determined in relation to the Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate or a Fixed Rate Term for all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance hereof, and at the end of each Fixed Rate Term, Borrower shall give Bank notice specifying: (i) the interest rate option selected by Borrower; (ii) the principal amount subject thereto; and (iii) for each LIBOR selection for a Fixed Rate Term, the length of the applicable Fixed Rate Term. Any such notice may be given by telephone (or such other electronic method as Bank may permit) so long as, with respect to each LIBOR selection for a Fixed Rate Term, (A) if requested by Bank, Borrower provides to Bank written confirmation thereof not later than three (3) Business Days after such notice is given, and (B) such notice is given to Bank prior to 10:00 a.m. on the first day of the Fixed Rate Term, or at a later time during any Business Day if Bank, at its sole option but without obligation to do so, accepts Borrower’s notice and quotes a fixed rate to Borrower. If Borrower does not immediately accept a fixed rate when quoted by Bank, the quoted rate shall expire and any subsequent LIBOR request from Borrower shall be subject to a redetermination by Bank of the applicable fixed rate. If no specific designation of interest is made at the time any advance is requested hereunder or at the end of any Fixed Rate Term, Borrower shall be deemed to have made a Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate interest selection for such advance or the principal amount to which such Fixed Rate Term applied.

^^**Taxes and Regulatory Costs**. Borrower shall pay to Bank immediately within fifteen (15) days after written demand, in addition to any other amounts due or to become due hereunder, any and all (i) withholdings, interest equalization taxes, stamp taxes or other taxes (except income and franchise taxes) imposed by any domestic or foreign governmental authority and related in any manner to LIBOR, and (ii) future, supplemental, emergency or other changes in the LIBOR Reserve Percentage, assessment rates imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or similar requirements or costs imposed by any domestic or foreign governmental authority or resulting from compliance by Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other governmental authority and related in any manner to LIBOR to the extent they are not included in the calculation of LIBOR. In determining which of the foregoing are attributable to any LIBOR option available to Borrower hereunder, any reasonable allocation made by Bank among its operations shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower.

^^**Payment of Interest**. Interest accrued on this Note shall be payable on the last day of each month, commencing [[Date 13: Date]].

^^**Default Interest**. From and after the maturity date of this Note, or such earlier date as all principal owing hereunder becomes due and payable by acceleration or otherwise, or at Bank’s option upon the occurrence, and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the outstanding principal balance of this Note shall bear interest at an increased rate per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed) equal to two percent ([[Percentage 8: Number]]%) above the rate of interest from time to time applicable to this Note (“Default Interest”).

\centered REPAYMENT AND PREPAYMENT: 

^^**Repayment**. Principal shall be payable on the last day of each month in installments of Three Hundred Thirty-Three Thousand Three Hundred Thirty Three and 33/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 19: Number]]) each, commencing [[Date 13]], and continuing up to and including [[Date 14: Date]], with a final installment consisting of all remaining unpaid principal due and payable in full on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

^^**Application of Payments**. Each payment made on this Note shall be credited first, to any interest then due and second, to the outstanding principal balance hereof. All payments credited to principal shall be applied first, to the outstanding principal balance of this Note which bears interest determined in relation to the Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate, if any, and second, to the outstanding principal balance of this Note which bears interest determined in relation to LIBOR, with such payments applied to the oldest Fixed Rate Term first.

^^**Prepayment**. Borrower shall repay the Note in accordance with Section 2.5(b) of the Credit Agreement and may prepay the Note as follows:

**Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate**. Borrower may prepay principal on any portion of this Note which bears interest determined in relation to the Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate at any time, in any amount and without penalty.

**LIBOR**. Borrower may prepay principal on any portion of this Note which bears interest determined in relation to LIBOR at any time and in the minimum amount of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 9]]); provided however, that if the outstanding principal balance of such portion of this Note is less than said amount, the minimum prepayment amount shall be the entire outstanding principal balance thereof. In consideration of Bank providing this prepayment option to Borrower, or if any such portion of this Note shall become due and payable at any time prior to the last day of the Fixed Rate Term applicable thereto by acceleration or otherwise, Borrower shall pay to Bank immediately upon demand a fee which is the sum of the discounted monthly differences for each month from the month of prepayment through the month in which such Fixed Rate Term matures, calculated as follows for each such month:

^^^**Determine** the amount of interest which would have accrued each month on the amount prepaid at the interest rate applicable to such amount had it remained outstanding until the last day of the Fixed Rate Term applicable thereto.

^^^**Subtract** from the amount determined in (i) above the amount of interest which would have accrued for the same month on the amount prepaid for the remaining term of such Fixed Rate Term at LIBOR in effect on the date of prepayment for new loans made for such term and in a principal amount equal to the amount prepaid.

^^^If the result obtained in (ii) for any month is greater than zero, discount that difference by LIBOR used in (ii) above.

Borrower acknowledges that prepayment of such amount may result in Bank incurring additional costs, expenses and/or liabilities, and that it is difficult to ascertain the full extent of such costs, expenses and/or liabilities. Borrower, therefore, agrees to pay the above-described prepayment fee and agrees that said amount represents a reasonable estimate of the prepayment costs, expenses and/or liabilities of Bank. If Borrower fails to pay any prepayment fee when due, the amount of such prepayment fee shall thereafter bear interest until paid at a rate per annum two percent ([[Percentage 7]]%) above the Daily Three Month LIBOR Rate in effect from time to time (computed on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed).

All prepayments of principal shall be applied on the most remote principal installment or installments then unpaid.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT:   
This Note is made pursuant to and is subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. Any default in the payment or performance of any obligation under this Note, or any Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, shall constitute an “Event of Default” under this Note.

MISCELLANEOUS:   
^^**Remedies**. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the holder of this Note, at the holder’s option and in addition to any other remedies set forth in the Credit Agreement, may declare all sums of principal and interest outstanding hereunder to be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, notice of nonperformance, notice of protest, protest or notice of dishonor, all of which are expressly waived by Borrower. Borrower shall pay to the holder immediately upon demand the full amount of all payments, advances, charges, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees (to include outside counsel fees and all allocated costs of the holder’s in-house counsel), expended or incurred by the holder in connection with the enforcement of the holder’s rights and/or the collection of any amounts which become due to the holder under this Note, and the prosecution or defense of any action in any way related to this Note, including without limitation, any action for declaratory relief, whether incurred at the trial or appellate level, in an arbitration proceeding or otherwise, and including any of the foregoing incurred in connection with any bankruptcy proceeding (including without limitation, any adversary proceeding, contested matter or motion brought by Bank or any other person) relating to Borrower or any other person or entity.

^^**Obligations Joint and Several**. Should more than one person or entity sign this Note as a Borrower, the obligations of each such Borrower shall be joint and several.

^^**Governing Law**. This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Note as of the date first written above.
