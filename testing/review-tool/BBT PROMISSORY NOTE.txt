If more than one party shall execute this Note, the term “undersigned” as used herein shall mean all the parties signing this Note and each of them, and all such parties shall be jointly and severally obligated hereunder.

All of the undersigned hereby waive all exemptions and homestead laws. The proceeds of the loan evidenced by this Note may be paid to any one or more of the undersigned.

The holder hereof, from time to time, shall have the unlimited right to release any person who might be liable hereon, and such release shall not affect or discharge the liability of any other person who is or might be liable hereon. No waivers and modifications shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the Bank. The Bank may, at its option, charge any fees for the modification, renewal, extension, or amendment of any of the terms of the Note permitted by law.
