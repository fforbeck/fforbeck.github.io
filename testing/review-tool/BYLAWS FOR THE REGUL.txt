^Validation of Defectively Called or Noticed Meeting.

The transactions of any meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, or who, though present, has, at the beginning of the meeting, properly objected to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened, or to particular matters of business legally required to be included in the notice, but not so included, signs a written waiver of notice, or a consent to the holding of such meeting, or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice or consent, except that if action is taken or proposed to be taken for approval of any of those matters specified in Section 3 above, the waiver of notice or consent shall state the general nature of the proposal.

^Inspectors of Election.

In advance of any meeting of shareholders, the board of directors may appoint any person or persons other than nominees for office as inspectors of election to act at such meeting or any adjournment thereof. If inspectors of election be not so appointed, the chairman of any such meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or his proxy shall, make such appointment at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the majority of shares represented in person or by proxy shall determine whether one(1) or three(3)inspectors are to be appointed. In case any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the vacancy may, and on the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall, be filled by appointment by the board of directors in advance of the meeting, or at the meeting by the chairman of the meeting.

The duties of such inspectors shall be as prescribed by the Wyoming Business Corporation Act and shall include: determining the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies; receiving votes, ballots or consents; hearing and determining all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote; counting and tabulating all votes or consents; determining when the polls shall close; determining the result; and such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders.

The inspectors of election shall perform their duties impartially, in good faith, to the best of their ability and as expeditiously as is practical. If there are three (3) inspectors of election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all. Any report or certificate made by the inspectors of election is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
