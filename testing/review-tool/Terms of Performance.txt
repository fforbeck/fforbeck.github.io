Under the following Award Terms, the Principal Amount is divided into three installments, and a different Performance Period is established with respect to each Installment, under paragraph 1 below. The Performance Retention Award (sometimes referred to as the “Award” or “Award Payment”) will be a cash distribution payable with respect to the Installment for each Performance Period, with the amount determined under paragraph 2 below, subject to the vesting restrictions under paragraph 3 below.

Paragraph 7 provides certain definitions that apply to these Award Terms.

^Performance Period and Installments. The Principal Amount is divided into three Installments. The Performance Period for each Installment, and the Principal Portion of each such Installment, is set forth in the following schedule (provided that the determination of the Performance Periods will be subject to paragraph 5):

**Installment Number:**      \centered **First Day of Performance Period:**      \centered **Last Day of Performance Period:**      \centered **Portion of Principal Amount Attributable to Installment:**

\centered [[Date 2: Date]]      \centered [[Date 3: Date]]       %

\centered [[Date 2]]      \centered [[Date 4: Date]]       %

\centered [[Date 2]]      \centered [[Date 5: Date]]       %

^Amount of Payment. The Award Payments will be subject to paragraph 3 and to the following:

^^The Award Payment for each Installment will equal the sum of the amounts described in paragraph (i) below and paragraph (ii) below:

^^^The product of (A) [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the Portion of the Principal Amount attributable to that Installment, multiplied by (B) a fraction, converted to an equivalent percentage, the numerator of which is the Company’s per-share Adjusted Book Value as of the last day of the applicable Performance Period and the denominator of which is the Company’s per-share Adjusted Book Value as of the first day of the applicable Performance Period.

^^^The product of (A) [[Percentage 1]]% of the Portion of the Principal Amount attributable to that Installment, multiplied by (B) a percentage equal to [[Percentage 2: Number]]% plus (or minus if negative) the Company’s Operating Return on Equity for the Performance Period attributable to that Installment.

^^The amount determined under both paragraph (a)(i) above and paragraph (a)(ii) above will be zero if both of the following are true:

^^^the percentage described in paragraph (a)(i)(B) for the Performance Period to which the Award is attributable is less than [[Percentage 2]]%; and

^^^the percentage described in paragraph (a)(ii)(B) above for the Performance Period to which the Award is attributable is less than the sum of: (A) [[Percentage 2]]% plus (B) the product of [[Percentage 3: Number]]% multiplied by the number of years and fractional years in the applicable Performance Period.

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 2 (but subject to the provisions of paragraph 5), if:

^^^by reason of paragraph (b) above, the Participant receives no payment with respect to the Installment for either the Performance Period ending [[Date 3]] or [[Date 4]] (each, a “Prior Performance Period”);

^^^in a subsequent Performance Period under this Agreement (the “Subsequent Performance Period”), either or both of paragraph (b)(i) and (b)(ii) above are satisfied; and

^^^the Participant’s Date of Termination has not occurred during the Subsequent Performance Period;

then, as soon as practicable after the end of the Subsequent Performance Period (and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 4), the Participant will receive the payment (without interest) he would have received for the Prior Performance Period if paragraph (b) above had not been applicable to him for the Prior Performance Period.

^Vesting and Forfeitures. Vesting of the Award Payment is subject to paragraph 5 and to the following:

^^If, in accordance with the following provisions of this paragraph 3, the Participant is vested in the Award Payment for any Performance Period, the Award Payment (if any) for that Performance Period will be due on the Payment Date as described in paragraph 4, subject to the terms of the Plan and these Award Terms. If the Participant is not vested in the Award for a Performance Period, the Participant will forfeit that Award.

^^If, with respect to any Installment, the Participant’s Date of Termination does not occur before the last day of the Performance Period for that Installment, the Participant will be vested in the Award Payment.

In no event may the amount payable under these Award Terms, when added to any other amounts payable under Section 4 of the LTIP to the Participant that are intended to constitute “performance-based compensation” as that term is used in the LTIP and section 162(m) of the Code, exceed the limit imposed by Section 5.2(e)(v) of the LTIP for the applicable performance period.

However, in no event may the Committee make such adjustments to the extent that the adjustments would result in amounts payable under this Agreement or other compensation payable to the Participant being nondeductible by the Company and its affiliates by reason of section 162(m).

^^Date of Termination. A Participant’s “Date of Termination” means the first day on which the Participant is not employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, regardless of the reason for the termination of employment; provided that a termination of employment shall not be deemed to occur by reason of a transfer of the Participant between the Company and a Subsidiary or between two Subsidiaries, nor by reason of a Participant’s termination of employment with the Company or a Subsidiary if immediately following such termination of employment the Participant continues to be or becomes a Director; and further provided that the Participant’s employment shall not be considered terminated while the Participant is on a leave of absence from the Company or a Subsidiary approved by the Participant’s employer.

^^Director. The term “Director” means a member of the Board, who may or may not be an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary.

^^Disabled. The Participant shall be considered to have a “Disability” during the period in which the Participant is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to engage in any substantial gainful activity, which condition, in the opinion of a physician selected by the Committee, is expected to have a duration of not less than 180 days.

^^Plan. “Plan” means the Assured Guaranty Ltd. Performance Retention Plan.

^^Principal Amount. The “Principal Amount” with respect to the Participant will be the Principal Amount as stated in the Award Letter.

^^Retirement. “Retirement” of a Participant will be determined in accordance with the following:

^^^Retirement shall mean the occurrence of a Participant’s Date of Termination with the consent of the Participant’s employer after the Participant has completed five years of service and attained age 55.

If, on or before the date of the initial public offering of stock of the Company, the Participant was employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries, years of service shall also include service with ACE Limited and its subsidiaries occurring prior to such the initial public offering.

^^^Notwithstanding that the Participant’s Date of Termination satisfies the requirements of paragraph (i) above, the Participant will not be considered to have retired (or have terminated by reason of Retirement) with respect to any Installment if the Committee determines that the Participant has provided significant commercial or business services to any one or more persons or entities on or before the last day of the Performance Period applicable to that Installment, regardless of whether such entity is owned or controlled by the Participant; provided that the Participant may devote reasonable time to the supervision of his personal investments, and activities involving professional, charitable, community, educational, religious and similar types of organizations, speaking engagements, membership on the boards of directors of other organizations, and similar types of activities, to the extent that the Committee, in its discretion, determines that such activities are consistent with the Participant’s Retirement.

^^^At the request of the Committee, and as a condition of receiving the Award Payment with respect to a Performance Period, the Participant shall be required to provide a listing of the activities engaged in by the Participant following the Participant’s Date of Termination and prior to the end of the Performance Period and such other information that the Committee determines may be necessary from time to time to establish whether the Participant has acted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of paragraph (iii) above.

^^^At the request of the Participant, the Committee shall determine whether a proposed activity of the Participant will be consistent with the requirements of paragraph (iii) above. Such request shall be accompanied by a description of the proposed activities, and the Participant shall provide such additional information as the Committee may determine is necessary to make the determination. Such a determination shall be made promptly, but in no event more than 30 days after the written request, together with any additional information requested of the Participant, is delivered to the Committee.

^^^If, with respect to any Performance Period, a Participant engages in one or more activities that the Committee determines to be inconsistent with Retirement, as set forth in paragraph (iii) above, the right to the Award Payment with respect to that Performance Period may be canceled by the Committee.

^^^If, after the Participant’s Date of Termination, an Award is otherwise payable in accordance with paragraphs 2(b) and 2(c): (A) the determination of whether the Participant has Retired and is entitled to such payment shall be contingent on the Participant having satisfied the requirements of paragraph (iii) above through the last day of the Subsequent Performance Period in which the performance occurs which gives rise to the payment under paragraphs 2(b) and 2(c); and (B) the requirement to provide information pursuant to paragraph (iv) above shall apply for periods through the last day of such Subsequent Performance Period.
