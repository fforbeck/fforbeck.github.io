Notwithstanding any provision hereof, Ms. Caldwell is an independent contractor (not an employee or other agent) solely responsible for the manner and hours in which Services are performed, is solely responsible for all taxes, withholdings, and other statutory, regulatory or contractual obligations of any sort (including, but not limited to, those relating to workers’ compensation, disability insurance, Social Security, unemployment compensation coverage, the Fair Labor Standards Act, income taxes, etc.), and is not entitled to any to participate in any employee benefit plans, fringe benefit programs, group insurance arrangements or similar programs.

^**Miscellaneous**. Any breach of Section 2 or 3 will cause irreparable harm to Company for which damages would not be a adequate remedy, and, therefore, Company will be entitled to injunctive relief with respect thereto in addition to any other remedies. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No changes or modifications or waivers to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys fees. Headings herein are for convenience of reference only and shall in no way affect interpretation of the Agreement.

Any controversy or claim (except those regarding Inventions, Proprietary Information or intellectual property) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided however that each party will have a right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of law. The prevailing party will be entitled to receive from the nonprevailing party all costs, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by the prevailing party in connection with that action or proceeding whether or not the controversy is reduced to judgment or award. The prevailing party will be that party who may be fairly said by the arbitrator(s) to have prevailed on the major disputed issues. The Ms. Caldwell hereby consents to the arbitration in the State of New Jersey.
