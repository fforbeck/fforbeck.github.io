\centered **Effect Of Transfer Documents** 

^The effect of Closing on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is as follows: 

^^Borrower and Guarantor acknowledge and agree that the consideration for the conveyance to Lender of all of Borrower’s right, title and interests in and to the Property is Lender’s release and covenant not to sue Borrower or Guarantor for any Indebtedness owing under the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents. Upon delivery and recording (as necessary) of the Transfer Documents, Lender’s release of Borrower and Guarantor shall be and become effective and Borrower and Guarantor shall have no further personal or other liability for payment of the Indebtedness. 

^^^^^ 
^^Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (1) the conveyance of the Property to Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement is an absolute conveyance of all of Borrower’s right, title and interest in and to each Property in fact as well as in form, and the Transfer Documents are not intended to be a security deed or security interest of any kind; (2) the consideration for that conveyance is exactly as recited in this Agreement; and (3) after delivery of the Transfer Documents to Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Borrower will have no redemption rights in, or claims in, to or against the Property or to the proceeds or profits that might be derived from the Property. 

^^The Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, and the security title of the Security Deed shall not be extinguished as a result of the Closing and delivery of the Transfer Documents but Borrower and Guarantor shall be released as provided in Section 1(a) above. The security title of the Security Deeds is not intended to be, and shall not be, (i) merged with the title conveyed pursuant to the Deeds, or (ii) released or relinquished in any manner or respect whatsoever on account of this Agreement, the transaction contemplated hereby, or delivery of the Transfer Documents to Lender. The Security Deeds shall remain valid and in full force and effect for the benefit of Lender, and the priority of each of the Security Deeds shall be maintained, until such Security Deed is expressly released by written instrument (a “Release Instrument”) executed by Lender and clearly expressing (and not merely implying) an intent to release and relinquish the Security Deed, which Release Instrument shall be recorded in the Fulton County, Georgia public records. Lender shall have the right and option, but not the obligation, to execute a Release Instrument as, if and when Lender shall determine to do so in the exercise of its sole and absolute discretion. 

^^Except as may be expressly provided in this Agreement and in the Transfer Documents to be delivered at Closing pursuant hereto, neither this Agreement nor any of the exhibits attached to this Agreement is intended to be, and none shall be deemed or construed to be, a reinstatement, novation, amendment, modification or release of the Loan Documents or any of them. Lender’s acceptance of the Transfer Documents shall not be deemed a waiver of any of Lender’s rights and remedies under this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, except as expressly provided herein and in the documents to be delivered at Closing pursuant hereto. 

^^At Closing, Borrower shall convey title to the Property to the Lender or Lender’s designee. Borrower and Lender agree that Lender or its designee shall have possession of the Property on the Closing Date, regardless of whether the Deeds have been recorded on that date. 

^All of the provisions of this section shall survive the Closing, the transfer of title to the Property, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
