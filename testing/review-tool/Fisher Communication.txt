**Plan Performance Measures and Weights** 

Performance measures are established before the end of the first quarter of the Plan period. 

Performance measures for all of the above employees will consist of [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the incentive based on Company Financial Performance or Fisher’s Adjusted EBITDA (which may be adjusted for certain circumstances by the Compensation Committee) and [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the incentive based on the achievement of individual objectives. 

Award payments for Adjusted EBITDA component will be based on the Payout as a Percent of Target which corresponds to the EBITDA achievement as a percent of target. The EBITDA payout will be calculated as follows: Payout as a percent of target x participant’s target bonus percent x [[Percentage 1]]%. 

The individual objectives component is based on a pool that also varies by the EBITDA achievement. The minimum funding level for the pool is .8 x sum of participants’ target bonus x [[Percentage 2]]%. The pool funding increases with levels of EBITDA achievement such that the pool is funded at [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the target opportunity at [[Percentage 3]]% EBITDA achievement and [[Percentage 4: Number]]% at [[Percentage 4]]% EBITDA achievement. Above [[Percentage 4]]% EBITDA achievement the pool increases [[Percentage 5: Number]]% for every [[Percentage 6: Number]]% increase in EBITDA achievement. For example, if EBITDA achievement is [[Percentage 7: Number]]% of target, the individual objectives pool is [[Percentage 8: Number]]%. If EBITDA achievement is [[Percentage 9: Number]]% of target or higher, the individual pool is [[Percentage 10: Number]]% of the target pool. Individual awards will vary based on individual performance. The sum of all individual awards will not exceed the total pool.
