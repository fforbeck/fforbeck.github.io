provided, however, that, in the case of (1), (2) and (3) above, the Liens (if any) granted to secure the Notes Obligations shall attach to any proceeds resulting from actions taken by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or any Revolving Credit Claimholder in accordance with this Agreement and remaining after application of such proceeds to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of a Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations. 

^^Until the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations has occurred, whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding has been commenced by or against any Grantor, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Revolving Credit Claimholders shall have the right to enforce rights, exercise remedies (including set-off and the right to credit bid their debt) and, in connection therewith make determinations regarding the release, disposition, or restrictions with respect to the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral without any consultation with, interference by (provided that any action permitted under this Agreement shall not constitute an interference) or the consent of the Notes Collateral Agent or any Notes Claimholder (including voluntary Dispositions of Revolving Credit Primary Collateral by the respective Grantors after a Revolving Credit Default); provided, however, that the Lien (if any) securing the Notes Obligations shall remain on the proceeds (other than those applied to the Revolving Credit Obligations) of such Revolving Credit Primary Collateral released or disposed of subject to the relative priorities described in Section 2. In exercising rights and remedies with respect to the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Revolving Credit Claimholders may enforce the provisions of the Revolving Credit Documents and exercise remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they may determine in the exercise of their sole discretion and without interference by the Notes Collateral Agent or the Notes Claimholders (provided that any action permitted under this Agreement shall not constitute an interference).

^file any necessary responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims of the Notes Claimholders, including any claims secured by the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, if any, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; 

^in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, file any pleadings, objections, motions or agreements which assert rights or interests available to unsecured creditors of the Grantors arising under either Bankruptcy Law or applicable non-bankruptcy law, in each case not prohibited by the terms of this Agreement; 

^in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, vote on any plan of reorganization with respect to the Notes Collateral; 

^exercise any of its rights or remedies with respect to any of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral after the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations has occurred; and 

^make a cash bid on all or any portion of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral in any foreclosure proceeding or action.

^^Subject to Section 3.1(c) and Section 6.3(c)(1): 

^the Notes Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Notes Claimholders, agrees that the Notes Collateral Agent and the Notes Claimholders will not take any action with respect to the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral that would hinder any exercise of remedies by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent under the Revolving Credit Documents or that is otherwise prohibited hereunder, including any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, whether by foreclosure or otherwise; 

^the Notes Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Notes Claimholders, hereby waives any and all rights the Notes Collateral Agent or the Notes Claimholders, as applicable, may have as a junior lien creditor with respect to the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral or otherwise to object to the manner in which the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Revolving Credit Claimholders seek to enforce or collect the Revolving Credit Obligations or the Liens securing the Revolving Credit Obligations granted in any of the Revolving Credit Documents or undertaken in accordance with this Agreement, regardless of whether any action or failure to act by or on behalf of the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Revolving Credit Claimholders is adverse to the interest of the Notes Claimholders; and 

^the Notes Collateral Agent hereby acknowledges and agrees that no covenant, agreement or restriction contained in the Notes Collateral Documents or any other Notes Document (other than this Agreement) shall be deemed to restrict in any way the rights and remedies of the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Revolving Credit Claimholders with respect to the enforcement of the Liens on the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral as set forth in this Agreement and the Revolving Credit Documents. 

^^Except as otherwise specifically set forth in Sections 3.1(a) and (c), the Notes Collateral Agent and the Notes Claimholders may exercise rights and remedies as unsecured creditors against any Grantor that has guaranteed or granted Liens to secure the Notes Obligations, and the Notes Collateral Agent may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Notes Collateral, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Notes Documents and applicable law; provided, however, that in the event that the Notes Collateral Agent or any Notes Claimholder becomes a judgment Lien creditor in respect of Revolving Credit Primary Collateral as a result of its enforcement of its rights as an unsecured creditor with respect to the Notes Obligations, such judgment Lien shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement for all purposes (including in relation to the Revolving Credit Obligations) as the other Liens securing the Notes Obligations are subject to this Agreement. 

^^Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the receipt by the Notes Collateral Agent or any Notes Claimholder of the required payments of interest, principal and other amounts owed in respect of the Notes Obligations, so long as such receipt is not the direct or indirect result of the exercise by the Notes Collateral Agent or any Notes Claimholder of rights or remedies as a secured creditor in respect of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral (including set-off) or enforcement in contravention of this Agreement of any Lien held by any of them. Nothing in this Agreement impairs or otherwise adversely affects any rights or remedies any Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Revolving Credit Claimholders may have against the Grantors under the Revolving Credit Documents.

^^If the Notes Collateral Agent, or any agent or representative of the Notes Collateral Agent, or any third party pursuant to any Enforcement undertaken by the Notes Collateral Agent, or any receiver, shall obtain possession or physical control of any of the Real Estate Assets, the Notes Collateral Agent or, if applicable, any such third party (at such address to be provided by the Notes Collateral Agent in connection with the applicable Enforcement) shall promptly notify the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent of that fact and the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent shall, within ten (10) Business Days thereafter, notify the Notes Collateral Agent as to whether it desires to exercise access rights under this Agreement, at which time the parties shall confer in good faith to coordinate with respect to the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent’s exercise of such access rights.

During the Access Period or for any period prior to an Access Period when the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent may have had access and/or use of any Notes Collateral (e.g. pursuant to access granted by a landlord of any Real Estate Asset), the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and its agents, representatives and designees shall have a non-exclusive right to have access to, and a rent free right to use, the Notes Collateral for the purpose of arranging for and effecting the sale or disposition of Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, including the production, completion, packaging, shipping and other preparation of such Revolving Credit Primary Collateral for sale or disposition. During any such Access Period (or period prior to an Access Period), the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and its representatives (and persons employed on their behalf), may continue to operate, service, maintain, process and sell the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, as well as to engage in bulk sales or other liquidations of Revolving Credit Primary Collateral. The US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent shall take proper care of any Notes Collateral that is used by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent during the Access Period and repair and replace any damage (ordinary wear-and-tear excepted) caused by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or its agents, representatives or designees and the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent shall comply with all applicable laws in connection with its use or occupancy of the Notes Collateral. The US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Revolving Credit Claimholders shall indemnify and hold harmless the Notes Collateral Agent and the Notes Claimholders for any injury or damage to Persons or property caused by the acts or omissions of Persons under its control. The US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to ensure that their activities during the Access Period as described above do not interfere materially with the activities of the other as described above, including the right of the Notes Collateral Agent to commence foreclosure of the Notes Mortgages or to show the Notes Collateral to prospective purchasers and to ready the Notes Collateral for sale. 

^^If the Notes Collateral Agent shall foreclose or otherwise sell any of the Notes Collateral, the Notes Collateral Agent will notify the buyer thereof of the existence of this Agreement and that the buyer is acquiring such Notes Collateral subject to the terms of this Agreement. 

^^The Grantors hereby agree with the Notes Collateral Agent and the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent that the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent shall have access, during the Access Period, as described herein and each such Grantor that owns any of the Mortgaged Premises grants a non-exclusive easement in gross over its property to permit the uses by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent contemplated by this Section 3.2. The Notes Collateral Agent consents to such easement and to the recordation of a collateral access easement agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Notes Collateral Agent, in the relevant real estate records with respect to each parcel of real property that is now or hereafter subject to a Notes Mortgage. The US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent agrees that upon either a Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations or the expiration of the final Access Period with respect to any parcel of real property covered by a Notes Mortgage, it shall, upon request, execute and deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent such documentation, in recordable form, as may reasonably be requested to terminate any and all rights with respect to such parcel of real property covered by a Notes Mortgage.

^^The Notes Collateral Agent hereby grants (to the full extent of its rights and interests) the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and each of its respective agents, representatives and designees a royalty free, rent free license and lease to use all of the Notes Collateral exclusive of Intellectual Property (covered in clause (b) below) but including any computer or other data processing Equipment to conduct sales or distribution activities on the Real Estate Assets during any Enforcement Period, to collect all Accounts or amounts owing under Instruments or Chattel Paper, to copy, use or preserve any and all information relating to any of the Collateral, and to complete the manufacture, packaging and sale of Inventory; provided, however, the royalty free, rent free license and lease granted in this clause (a) with respect to Equipment shall immediately expire upon the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of such Equipment. 

^^The Notes Collateral Agent hereby grants (to the full extent of its rights and interests) the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and each of its respective agents, representatives and designees solely during the Enforcement Period, (A) a nonexclusive, royalty free, worldwide license or sublicense (subject to the terms of the underlying license) to use all of the Notes Collateral constituting Intellectual Property to the extent necessary or reasonably helpful to collect all Accounts or amounts owing with respect to any Revolving Credit Primary Collateral and to complete the manufacture, packaging and sale of Inventory and (B) a nonexclusive, royalty free, worldwide license or sublicense (subject to the terms of the underlying license) (which will be binding on any successor or assignee of the Intellectual Property) to use any and all Intellectual Property in connection with its Enforcement; provided, however, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, during the term of the above licenses, shall use any Trademarks of such licensed Intellectual Property solely in connection with (x) goods or services which the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent in good faith reasonably believes to be in all material respects of at least the same level of quality offered by, and in a manner in which the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent in good faith reasonably believes to be in all material respects consistent with the practices of, one or more Grantors as of the date of the Enforcement Notice or (y) the disposition of damaged, obsolete or second-quality goods which dispositions the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent in good faith reasonably believes will not materially diminish the distinctiveness and quality characteristics associated with such Intellectual Property or the validity thereof (it being understood and agreed that the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and each of its respective agents, representatives and designees shall comply in all material respects with all laws pertaining to its use of Intellectual Property described hereunder, including notice requirements).

The Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the Revolving Credit Claimholders, and the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the Notes Claimholders, each agree that after an issuance of an Enforcement Notice, each such Person shall cooperate in good faith to identify the proceeds of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral and the Notes Collateral, as the case may be (it being agreed that after an issuance of an Enforcement Notice, unless the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent has actual knowledge to the contrary, all funds deposited under Account Agreements and then applied to the Revolving Credit Obligations shall be presumed to be Revolving Credit Primary Collateral (a presumption that can be rebutted by the Notes Collateral Agent only by evidence presented to the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent within thirty (30) Business Days after such application)); provided, however, that neither any Revolving Credit Claimholder nor any Notes Claimholder shall be liable or in any way responsible for any claims or damages from conversion of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral or the Notes Collateral, as the case may be (it being understood and agreed that (A) the only obligation of any Revolving Credit Claimholder is to pay over to the Notes Collateral Agent, in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements, all proceeds that such Revolving Credit Claimholder received that have been identified as proceeds of the Notes Collateral (except to the extent that such proceeds are represented by a Net Cash Proceeds Letter of Credit) and (B) the only obligation of any Notes Claimholder is to pay over to the Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements, all proceeds that such Notes Claimholder received that have been identified as proceeds of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral). The US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent may request from the other an accounting of the identification of the proceeds of Collateral (and the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent, as the case may, upon which such request is made shall deliver such accounting reasonably promptly after such request is made). 

^^^Payments. 

^^Application of Proceeds. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.5 hereof, so long as the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding has been commenced by or against any Grantor, all Revolving Credit Primary Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such Revolving Credit Primary Collateral upon the exercise of remedies by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Revolving Credit Claimholders, shall be applied by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent to the Revolving Credit Obligations in such order as specified in the relevant Revolving Credit Documents. Upon the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent shall deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent any Collateral and proceeds of Collateral held by it in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct to be applied by the Notes Collateral Agent to the Notes Obligations in such order as specified in the Notes Documents. 

^^Payments Over in Violation of Agreement. Unless and until the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations has occurred, whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding has been commenced by or against any Grantor, any Collateral or proceeds thereof received by the Notes Collateral Agent or any Notes Claimholder in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy (including set-off) relating to the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral in contravention of this Agreement shall be segregated and held in trust and forthwith paid over to the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Claimholders in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. 

^^^Other Agreements. 

^^Releases. 

^^If in connection with the exercise of any of the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent’s remedies in respect of any Revolving Credit Primary Collateral as provided for in Section 3.1, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, for itself and/or on behalf of any of the Revolving Credit Claimholders, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, then the Liens, if any, of the Notes Collateral Agent, for itself and/or for the benefit of the Notes Claimholders, on the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral sold or disposed of in connection with such exercise, shall be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. The Notes Collateral Agent, for itself and/or on behalf of any such Notes Claimholders, promptly shall execute and deliver to the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or such Grantor such termination statements, releases and other documents as the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or such Grantor may request to effectively confirm such release. 

^^If in connection with any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Revolving Credit Primary Collateral (collectively, a “Disposition”) permitted under the terms of the Revolving Credit Documents (including voluntary Dispositions of Revolving Credit Primary Collateral by the respective Grantors after a Revolving Credit Default) 

(other than in connection with the exercise of any of the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent’s rights and remedies in respect of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral as provided for in Sections 3.1), the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, for itself and/or on behalf of any of the Revolving Credit Claimholders, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, in each case, other than (A) in connection with the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations or (B) after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Notes Default if, all of the net proceeds received in connection with such Disposition are not applied to the Revolving Credit Obligations, then, in each case, the Liens, if any, of the Notes Collateral Agent, for itself and/or for the benefit of the Notes Claimholders, on such Revolving Credit Primary Collateral shall be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. The Notes Collateral Agent for itself and/or on behalf of any such Notes Claimholders promptly shall execute and deliver to the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or such Grantor such termination statements, releases and other documents as the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or such Grantor may request to effectively confirm such release. The Notes Collateral Agent, for itself and/or on behalf of any such Notes Claimholders, hereby agrees to consent to any request by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent that the Notes Collateral Agent, for itself and/or on behalf of any such Notes Claimholders, releases its security interest in connection with a Disposition under this Section 5.1(b). 

^^Until the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations shall occur, the Notes Collateral Agent, for itself and/or on behalf of the Notes Claimholders, hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and any of its officers or agents, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of the Notes Collateral Agent or such Notes Claimholder, whether in the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent’s name or, at the option of the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, in the Notes Collateral Agent’s or any Notes Claimholder’s own name, from time to time in the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent’s discretion, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Section 5.1, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Section 5.1, including any endorsements or other instruments of transfer or release. 

^^Insurance. 

^^Unless and until the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations has occurred, subject to the terms of, and the rights of the Grantors under, the Revolving Credit Documents, (i) the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Revolving Credit Claimholders shall have the sole and exclusive right to adjust settlement for any insurance policy covering the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral or the Liens with respect thereto in the event of any loss thereunder or with respect thereto and to approve any award granted in any condemnation or similar proceeding (or any deed in lieu of condemnation) affecting such Revolving Credit Primary Collateral; (ii) all proceeds of any such policy and any such award (or any payments with respect to a deed in lieu of condemnation) if in respect to such Revolving Credit Primary Collateral and to the extent required by the Revolving Credit Documents shall be paid to the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Claimholders pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Documents (including, without limitation, for purposes of cash collateralization of letters of credit) and thereafter, to the extent no Revolving Credit Obligations which were secured by such Revolving Credit Primary Collateral are outstanding, and subject to the terms of, and the rights of the Grantors under, the Notes Documents, to the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Notes Claimholders to the extent required under the Notes Collateral Documents and then, to the extent no Notes Obligations which were secured by such Revolving Credit Primary Collateral are outstanding, to the owner of the subject property, such other Person as may be entitled thereto or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct, and (iii) if the Notes Collateral Agent or any Notes Claimholder shall, at any time, receive any proceeds of any such insurance policy or any such award or payment in contravention of this Agreement, it shall segregate and hold in trust and forthwith pay such proceeds over to the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of Section 4.2. The Notes Collateral Agent shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle and adjust any insurance policy to the extent relating to the Notes Collateral. 

^^To effectuate the foregoing, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent shall each receive separate lender’s loss payable endorsements naming themselves as loss payee and additional insured, as their interests may appear, with respect to policies which insure Collateral hereunder. To the extent any proceeds are received for business interruption or for any liability or indemnification and those proceeds are not compensation for a casualty loss with respect to the Notes Collateral, such proceeds shall first be applied to repay the Revolving Credit Obligations and then be applied, to the extent required by the Notes Documents, to the Notes Obligations. 

^^Amendments to Revolving Credit Documents and Notes Documents; Refinancing; Legending Provisions. 

^^The Revolving Credit Documents and the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, in each case, in accordance with the terms of both the Revolving Credit Documents and the Notes Documents, and the Revolving Credit Obligations and Notes Obligations may be Refinanced, in each case, without notice to, or the consent (except to the extent a consent is required to permit the Refinancing transaction under any Revolving Credit Document or any Notes Document) of the Revolving Credit Claimholders or the Notes Claimholders, as the case may be, all without affecting the Lien subordination or other provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the holders of such Refinancing debt bind themselves in a writing reasonably acceptable to the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent and addressed to the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Notes Collateral Agent, as the case may be, to the terms of this Agreement and any such amendment, supplement, modification or Refinancing shall be in accordance with the provisions of both the Revolving Credit Documents and the Notes Documents. 

^^Each Grantor agrees that each security agreement, pledge agreement and mortgage that is a Notes Collateral Document shall include the following language (or language to similar effect approved by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent): 

“Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the lien and security interest in certain Collateral granted to the Notes Collateral Agent or other Person, as applicable pursuant to this Agreement and the exercise of any right or remedy by the Notes 

Collateral Agent or other Person, as applicable in respect of such Collateral hereunder are subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of December , 2009 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “**Intercreditor Agreement**”), among [[US Borrower]], a Nevada corporation, (2) [[Holdings]] II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“**Holdings**”), (3) JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., in its capacity as U.S. collateral agent for the Revolving Credit Obligations, (4) JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., in its capacity as U.S. administrative agent for the Revolving Credit Obligations, and (5) THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON, in its capacity as collateral agent for the Notes Obligations and certain other persons which may be or become parties thereto or become bound thereto from time to time. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall govern and control. The foregoing is only applicable to any Revolving Credit Primary Collateral as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement.” 

^^Without limiting any obligation to obtain any consent required under Section 5.3(a), the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party of any written amendment or modification to any Revolving Credit Document or any Notes Document, as applicable, but the failure to do so shall not create a cause of action against the party failing to give such notice or create any claim or right on behalf of any third party. In connection with amendments or modifications permitted by Section 5.3, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall, upon request of the other party, provide copies of all such modifications or amendments and copies of all other relevant documentation to the other Person. 

^^Bailees for Perfection. 

^^The US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent agrees to hold that part of the Collateral that is in its possession or control (or in the possession or control of its agents or bailees) to the extent that possession or control thereof is taken to perfect a Lien thereon under the UCC (such Collateral being the “**Pledged Collateral**”) as collateral agent for the Revolving Credit Claimholders, and as bailee for the Notes Collateral Agent (such bailment being intended, among other things, to satisfy the requirements of Sections 8-106(d)(3), 8-301(a)(2) and 9-313(c) of the UCC) and any assignee solely for the purpose of perfecting the security interest granted under the Revolving Credit Documents and the Notes Documents, as applicable, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 5.4. 

^^The US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to the Notes Collateral Agent or to any Notes Claimholder to ensure that the Pledged Collateral is genuine or owned by any of the Grantors or to preserve rights or benefits of any Person except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.4. The duties or responsibilities of the US 

Revolving Credit Collateral Agent under this Section 5.4 shall be limited solely to holding the Pledged Collateral as bailee in accordance with this Section 5.4 and delivering the Pledged Collateral upon a Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations, as provided in paragraph (d) below, so that, subject to the terms of this Agreement, until a Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent shall be entitled to deal with the Pledged Collateral or Collateral within its “control” in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and other Revolving Credit Documents (but only to the extent that such Collateral constitutes Revolving Credit Primary Collateral) as if the Liens (if any) of the Notes Collateral Agent did not exist. 

^^The Revolving Credit Collateral Agent acting pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall not have by reason of the Revolving Credit Documents, this Agreement or any other document a fiduciary relationship with the Notes Collateral Agent or any Notes Claimholder with respect to such acts. 

^^Upon the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent shall deliver the remaining Pledged Collateral (if any) together with any necessary endorsements, to the Notes Collateral Agent to the extent the Notes Obligations which are secured by such Pledged Collateral remain outstanding (so as to allow the Notes Collateral Agent to obtain possession or control of such Pledged Collateral). The US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent further agrees to take all other action reasonably requested by the Notes Collateral Agent in connection with the Notes Collateral Agent obtaining a first-priority interest in the Collateral or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. 

^^When Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations and Discharge of Notes Obligations Deemed to Not Have Occurred. If concurrently with the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations or the Discharge of Notes Obligations, any Grantor thereafter enters into any Refinancing of any Revolving Credit Obligation or any Notes Obligation, as the case may be, which Refinancing is permitted by both the Notes Documents and the Revolving Credit Documents and this Agreement, then such Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations or the Discharge of Notes Obligations, shall automatically be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement (other than with respect to any actions taken as a result of the occurrence of such first Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations or the Discharge of Notes Obligations) and, from and after the date on which the New Debt Notice (as defined below) is delivered to the Notes Collateral Agent or the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, as appropriate, in accordance with the next sentence, the obligations under such Refinancing shall automatically be treated as Revolving Credit Obligations or Notes Obligations, as the case may be, for all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of Collateral set forth herein, and the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or Notes Collateral Agent, as the case may be, under such new Revolving Credit Documents or new Notes Documents shall be the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Notes Collateral Agent for all purposes of this Agreement. Upon receipt of a notice (the “**New Debt Notice**”) stating that any Grantor has entered into new Revolving Credit Documents or new Notes Documents (which notice shall include a complete copy of the relevant new documents and provide the identity of the new agent or trustee for such facility or issuance, such agent or trustee, the “**New Agent**”), the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Notes Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly (a) enter into such documents and agreements (including amendments or supplements to this Agreement) as such Grantor or such New Agent shall reasonably request in order to provide to the New Agent the rights contemplated hereby, in each case consistent in all material respects with the terms of this Agreement and (b) deliver, to the extent contemplated by this Agreement, to the New Agent any Pledged Collateral that is Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, in the case of a New Agent that is the agent under any new Revolving Credit Documents) held by it together with any necessary endorsements (or otherwise allow the New Agent to obtain control of such Pledged Collateral). The New Agent shall agree in a writing addressed to the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Revolving Credit Claimholders or the Notes Collateral Agent and the Notes Claimholders, as the case may be, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If the Revolving Credit Obligations under the new Revolving Credit Documents are secured by assets of the Grantors constituting Revolving Credit Primary Collateral that do not also secure the Notes Obligations, then the Notes Obligations shall be secured at such time by a second priority Lien on such assets to the same extent provided in the Revolving Credit Collateral Documents, the Notes Collateral Documents and this Agreement. 

^^^Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings. 

^^Finance and Sale Issues. 

^^Until the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations has occurred, if any Grantor shall be subject to any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent shall agree to permit the use of “Cash Collateral” (as such term is defined in Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code) other than the identifiable cash proceeds of any Notes Collateral, on which a Lien has been granted to the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent pursuant to the Revolving Credit Documents or to permit any Grantor to obtain financing, whether from the Revolving Credit Claimholders or any other Person under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar Bankruptcy Law (“**DIP Financing**”), then the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the Notes Claimholders, agrees that it will raise no objection to or contest such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing so long as such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing meet the following requirements: (i) the aggregate principal amount of the DIP Financing plus the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Credit Obligations plus the aggregate face amount of any letters of credit issued and not reimbursed under the Revolving Credit Agreement does not exceed the sum of the Revolving Credit Cap Amount and the DIP Financing Cap Amount, (ii) the Notes Collateral Agent and the Notes Claimholders retain the right to object to any ancillary agreements or arrangements regarding the Cash Collateral use or the DIP Financing that are materially prejudicial to their interests in the Notes Collateral (other than any Real Estate Assets upon which a Lien has not been perfected), (iii) the terms of the DIP Financing (A) do not compel the applicable Grantor to seek confirmation of a specific plan of reorganization for which all or substantially all of the material terms are set forth in the DIP Financing documentation or a related document and (B) do not expressly require the liquidation of the Collateral prior to a default under the DIP Financing documentation or Cash Collateral order, and (iv) any Lien on the Notes Collateral to secure such DIP Financing is subordinate to the Lien of the Notes Collateral Agent with respect thereto. To the extent the Liens securing the Revolving Credit Obligations are subordinated to or pari passu with such DIP Financing which meets the requirements of clauses (i) through (iv) above, the Notes Collateral Agent will subordinate its Liens in the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral to the Liens securing such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto) and to any “Carve Out” from the Liens securing such DIP Financing for the benefit of professionals entitled to compensation from any Grantor’s estate provided for in connection with such DIP Financing, and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except, as expressly agreed by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or to the extent permitted by Section 6.3). 

^^Until the Discharge of Notes Obligations has occurred, if any Grantor shall be subject to any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and the Notes Collateral Agent shall agree to permit the use of “Cash Collateral” (as such term is defined in Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code) other than Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, on which a Lien has been granted to the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the Notes Documents or to permit any Grantor to obtain DIP Financing, then the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the Revolving Credit Claimholders, agrees that it will raise no objection to or contest such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing so long as such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing meet the following requirements: (i) the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent and the Revolving Credit Claimholders retain the right to object to any ancillary agreements or arrangements regarding the Cash Collateral use or the DIP Financing that are materially prejudicial to their interests in the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, (ii) the terms of the DIP Financing (A) do not compel the applicable Grantor to seek confirmation of a specific plan of reorganization for which all or substantially all of the material terms are set forth in the DIP Financing documentation or a related document and (B) do not expressly require the liquidation of the Collateral prior to a default under the DIP Financing documentation or Cash Collateral order, and (iii) any Lien on the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral to secure such DIP Financing is subordinate to the Lien of the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent with respect thereto. To the extent the Liens securing the Notes Obligations are subordinated to or pari passu with such DIP Financing which meets the requirements of clauses (i) through (iii) above, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent will subordinate its Liens in the Notes Collateral to the Liens securing such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto) and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except, as expressly agreed by the Notes Collateral Agent or to the extent permitted by Section 6.3). 

^^Until the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations has occurred, if any Grantor shall be subject to any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent shall, acting in accordance with the Revolving Credit Agreement, agree to permit a sale of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral free and clear of Liens or other claims, under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, then each Notes Claimholder agrees that it will not raise any objection to or contest such sale or request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (it being understood that the Notes Claimholders still, but subject to this Agreement, have rights with respect to the proceeds of such Collateral). 

^^Until the Discharge of Notes Obligations has occurred, if any Grantor shall be subject to any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and the Notes Collateral Agent shall, acting in accordance with the Notes Documents, agree to permit a sale of the Notes Collateral free and clear of Liens or other claims, under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, then each Revolving Credit Claimholder agrees that it will not raise any objection to or contest such sale or request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (it being understood that the Revolving Credit Claimholders still, but subject to this Agreement, have rights with respect to the proceeds of such Collateral). 

^^Relief from the Automatic Stay. 

^^Until the Discharge of Revolving Credit Obligations has occurred, the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the Notes Claimholders, agrees that none of them shall seek (or support any other Person seeking) relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding in respect of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, without the prior written consent of the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent. 

^^Until the Discharge of Notes Obligations has occurred, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the Revolving Credit Claimholders, agrees that none of them shall seek (or support any other Person seeking) relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding in respect of the Notes Collateral (other than to the extent such relief is required to exercise its rights under Section 3.2 or Section 3.3), without the prior written consent of the Notes Collateral Agent. 

^^Adequate Protection. 

^^The Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the Notes Claimholders, agrees that none of them shall contest (or support any other Person contesting): 

^any request by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Revolving Credit Claimholders for adequate protection with respect to the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral; provided that (A) such adequate protection claim shall not seek the creation of any Lien over additional assets or property of any Grantor other than with respect to assets or property that constitute Revolving Credit Primary Collateral and (B) if such additional assets or property shall also constitute Notes Collateral, (i) a Lien shall have been created in favor of the Notes Claimholders in respect of such Collateral and (ii) the Lien in favor of the Revolving Credit Claimholders shall be subordinated to the extent set forth in this Agreement; or 

^any objection by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Revolving Credit Claimholders to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Revolving Credit Claimholders claiming a lack of adequate protection with respect to the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral. 

^^The US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the Revolving Credit Claimholders, agrees that none of them shall contest (or support any other Person contesting): 

^any request by the Notes Collateral Agent or any Notes Claimholders for adequate protection with respect to the Notes Collateral; provided that (A) such adequate protection claim shall not seek the creation of any Lien over additional assets or property of any Grantor other than with respect to assets or property that constitute Notes Collateral and (B) if such additional assets or property shall also constitute Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, (i) a Lien shall have been created in favor of the Revolving Credit Claimholders in respect of such Collateral and (ii) the Lien in favor of the Notes Claimholders shall be subordinated to the extent set forth in this Agreement; or 

^any objection by the Notes Collateral Agent or any Notes Claimholders to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on the Notes Collateral Agent or the Notes Claimholders claiming a lack of adequate protection with respect to the Notes Collateral. 

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions in this Section 6.3, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding: 

^if the Revolving Credit Claimholders (or any subset thereof) are granted, or in the event the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself or any of the Revolving Credit Claimholders, seeks or requests adequate protection with respect to the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral in the form of additional collateral (even if such collateral is not of a type which would otherwise have constituted Revolving Credit Primary Collateral) in connection with any Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing, then, in either case, the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself or any of the Notes Claimholders, may seek or request adequate protection with respect to its interests in such additional collateral in the form of a Lien on the same additional collateral, which Lien will be subordinated (except to the extent that the Notes Collateral Agent already had a Lien on such Collateral (in which case the priorities established by Section 2.1 shall apply)) to the Liens securing the Revolving Credit Obligations and such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens of the Notes Collateral Agent on Revolving Credit Primary Collateral; and 

^if the Notes Claimholders (or any subset thereof) are granted, or in the event the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself or any of the Notes Claimholders, seeks or requests adequate protection with respect to the Notes Collateral in the form of additional collateral (even if such collateral is not of a type which would otherwise have constituted Notes Collateral) in connection with any Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing, then, in either case, the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself or any of the Revolving Credit Claimholders, may seek or request adequate protection with respect to its interests in such additional collateral in the form of a Lien on the same additional collateral, which Lien will be subordinated (except to the extent that the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent already had a Lien on such Collateral (in which case the priorities established by Section 2.1 shall apply)) to the Liens securing the Notes Obligations and such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens of the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent on Notes Collateral. 

^^Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Section or in Section 6.1 or in connection with the exercise of remedies with respect to the Collateral, nothing herein shall limit the rights of (i) the Notes Collateral Agent or the Notes Claimholders from seeking adequate protection with respect to their rights in the Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding (including adequate protection in the form of a cash payment, periodic cash payments or otherwise) and (ii) the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or the Revolving Credit Claimholders from seeking adequate protection with respect to their rights in the Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding (including adequate protection in the form of a cash payment, periodic cash payments or otherwise). 

^^Avoidance Issues. If any Revolving Credit Claimholder or Notes Claimholder is required in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or otherwise to turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of any Grantor any amount paid in respect of Revolving Credit Obligations or the Notes Obligations, as the case may be (a “**Recovery**”), then such Revolving Credit Claimholders or Notes Claimholders shall be entitled to a reinstatement of Revolving Credit Obligations or Notes Obligations, as the case may be, with respect to all such recovered amounts. If this Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, this Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties hereto from such date of reinstatement. 

^^Reorganization Securities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, (i) the Revolving Credit Claimholders or the Notes Claimholders (the “**Applicable Junior Lien Claimholders**”) receive pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan a distribution of debt obligations (“**Junior Lien Reorganization Securities**”) in whole or in part on account of any junior Liens on the Notes Collateral or the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral, as the case may be (such Collateral as to which the applicable Claimholders have a junior Lien, the “**Applicable Junior Collateral**”) that are secured by Liens on such Applicable Junior Collateral, and (ii) the other Claimholders (the “**Applicable Senior Lien Claimholders**”) receive pursuant to such plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan a distribution of debt obligations (“**Senior Lien Reorganization Securities**”) in whole or in part on account of their Revolving Credit Obligations or Notes Obligations, as the case may be, that are secured by Liens on such Applicable Junior Collateral, then (i) the Applicable Junior Lien Claimholders shall be entitled to retain their Junior Lien Reorganization Securities and shall not be obligated to turnover same to any or all of the Applicable Senior Lien Claimholders, and (ii) to the extent the Junior Lien Reorganization Securities and the Senior Lien Reorganization Securities are secured by Liens upon the same Applicable Junior Collateral, the provisions of this Agreement will survive the distribution of such Junior Lien Reorganization Securities and Senior Lien Reorganization Securities and will apply with like effect to the Junior Lien Reorganization Securities and Senior Lien Reorganization Securities, to such Liens securing such Junior Lien Reorganization Securities and Senior Lien Reorganization Securities and to the distribution of proceeds of such Applicable Junior Collateral. 

^^Post-Petition Interest. 

^^Neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor any Notes Claimholder shall oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent or any Revolving Credit Claimholder for allowance in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of Revolving Credit Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of the Lien securing any Revolving Credit Claimholder’s claim, without regard to the existence of the Lien of the Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the Notes Claimholders on the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral. 

^^Neither the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent nor any Revolving Credit Claimholder shall oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the Notes Collateral Agent or any Notes Claimholder for allowance in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of Notes Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of the Lien securing any Notes Claimholder’s claim, without regard to the existence of the Lien of the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent on behalf of the Revolving Credit Claimholders on the Notes Collateral. 

^^Separate Grants of Security and Separate Classification. Each of the US Revolving Credit Collateral Agent, Revolving Credit Claimholders, Notes Collateral Agent and Notes Claimholders acknowledges and agrees that (a) the grants of Liens pursuant to the Revolving Credit Collateral Documents and the Notes Collateral Documents constitute two separate and distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Revolving Credit Obligations and the Notes Obligations are fundamentally different from one another and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization proposed or adopted in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the claims of the Revolving Credit Claimholders and the Notes Claimholders in respect of the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims), then the Revolving Credit Claimholders shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them from, or in respect of, the Revolving Credit Primary Collateral with respect to principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing with respect to post-petition interest, fees, costs, and other charges, irrespective of whether a claim for such amounts is allowed or allowable in any such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, before any distribution from, or in respect of, any such Revolving Credit Primary Collateral is made in respect of the claims held by the Notes Claimholders, with the Notes Claimholders hereby acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Revolving Credit Claimholders amounts otherwise received or receivable by them to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Notes Claimholders. 

^^Waiver. Each Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Claimholders, waives any claim it may hereafter have against any other Claimholder arising out of the election of such Claimholder of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, and/or out of any cash collateral or financing arrangement or out of any grant of a security interest in connection with the Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.
