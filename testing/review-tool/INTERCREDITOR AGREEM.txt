NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

^**Rights and Remedies With Respect to Property other than Account** **Receivables and Post-Closing Receivables**. Junior Lender agrees that notwithstanding the respective dates of execution or delivery, or the relative order or time of filing or recording, the priority of the liens and security interests which secure the Junior Lender's Note with respect to its rights in and to the Property other than (i) the Account Receivables and (ii) the Post-Closing Receivables shall at all times be subordinate to the liens and security interests which secure the Senior Lender's Notes with respect to the rights in and to the Property othe r than (i) the Account Receivables and (ii) the Post-Closing Receivables enjoyed by Senior Lender.

^**Rights and Remedies With Respect to the Account Receivables and the Post-****Closing Receivables**. Senior Lender agrees that notwithstanding the respective dates of execution or delivery, or the relative order or time of filing or recording, the priority of the liens and security interests which secure the Senior Lender's Notes with respect to its rights in and to (i) the Account Receivables and (ii) the Post-Closing Receivables shall at all times be subordinate to the liens and security interests which secure the Junior Lender's Note with respect to the rights in and to (i) the Account Receivables and (ii) the Post-Clos ing Receivables enjoyed by Junior Lender.

**provided**, **however,** that if under this Section 4 Junior Lender timely elects to foreclose or otherwise enforce any lien or security interest with respect to Junior Lender's rights in and to (i) the Account Receivables and (ii) the Post-Closing Receivables under Junior Lender's Security Agreement, Senior Lender thereafter shall at all times subordinate Senior Lender's liens and security interests in the public records to the liens and security interests of Junior Lender as to all (i) the Account Receivables and (ii) the Post-Closing Receivables subject to the foreclosure or enforcement action, all to the effect and for the purpose of preventing the foreclosure or enforcement action by Senior Lender from discharging or in any way adversely affecting Junior Lender's security interest in (i) the Account Receivables and (ii) the Post-Closing Receivables. Borrower hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that an Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Lender's Notes) shall be an Event of Default (as defined in the Junior Lender's Note) and shall entitle Junior Lender to commence a foreclosure or enforcement action in accordance with the Junior Lender's Security Agreement.

^**Limitations on Payment; Cross-Default; Cost of Collection**.

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Junior Lender shall at all times have the right to ask, demand, take and receive payments from Borrower as and when same may become due pursuant to the Junior Lender's Note, without limitation.

^^So long as the Junior Lender's Note (or any portion thereof) remains unpaid and outstanding, Senior Lender shall not ask, demand, take or receive from Borrower (and Borrower shall in no event make) any payments of principal under the Senior Lender's Notes.

^^Except as expressly set forth in Section 5(b) above, Senior Lender shall at all times have the right to ask, demand, take and receive payments from Borrower as and when same may become due pursuant to the Senior Lender's Notes, without limitation. Additionally, at any time from and after the date Junior Lender gives Senior Lender written notice that an "Event of Default" exists under the Junior Lender's Note, (i) Senior Lender may immediately exercise its rights with respect to the Property other than (A) the Account Receivables and (B) the Post-Closing Receivables under the Senior Lender's Security Agreements (including, without limitation, foreclosing or otherwise enforcing any lien or security interest with respect thereto), and/or (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 4 above, Senior Lender may immediately exercise its rights with respect (A) the Account Receivables and (B) the Post-Closing Receivables under the Senior Lender's Security Agreements (including, without limitation, foreclosing or otherwise enforcing any lien or security interest with respect thereto). Junior Lender agrees that, if Junior Lender gives to Senior Lender written notice that an Event of Default exists under Junior Lender's Note, Junior Lender will give Senior Lender written notice that such Event of Default has been cured or waived within three (3) business days of such cure or waiver.

^**Rights of [[s Notes]], [[Party 4]] and 3-DRSI**. [[s Notes]], [[Party 4]] and 3-DRSI hereby agree that their respective rights under the Senior Lender's Notes, the Senior Lender's Security Agreements, and this Agreement, including, without limitation, their rights to receive payment from the Borrower, shall be in direct proportion to the principal balance plus accrued interest then outstanding on each of their respective Notes.

^**Notice of Default**. The parties agree to provide each other party with notice in the event any of them declares Borrower to be in default with respect to the Senior Lender's Notes or Junior Lender's Note. Although the parties have agreed to provide notices of default, the failure of a party to provide the notices of default described herein shall not negate or in any way adversely affect or impair the validity of the declaration of default declared by the party declaring Borrower in default.

^**No Third Party Beneficiaries**. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and shall not benefit in any way any person not specifically a party to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, Borrower or any guarantors. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto specifically reserve any and all of their respective rights, liens and security interests and right to assert liens and security interests against Borrower and any third parties, including guarantors.

^**Rights are Independent of Time of Attachment or Perfection**. The parties agree that their respective rights and priorities set forth herein shall exist and be enforceable independent of the time or order of attachment or perfection of the respective liens and security interests, or the time or order of the filing of financing statements or the receipt of possession or control of any Collateral. Each party, nevertheless, agrees to make such filings and recordings in the public records to evidence the subordinations and priorities made herein as the other parties may reasonably request.

^**Agreement Conditioned Upon Validity and Perfection**. The priority of each party with respect to the Collateral specified in this Agreement is expressly conditioned upon the nonavoidability and perfection of the security interests to which it applies and if a security interest as to which another security interest is junior in priority is not perfected or is avoidable for any reason, then the priority arrangements provided for in this Agreement shall be ineffective as to the particular Collateral which is the subject of the unperfected or avoidable security interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party to this Agreement shall contest the validity, perfection or priority of any lien or sec urity interest held by any other party to this Agreement.

^**Termination, Recision or Modification**. The subordinations, agreements, and priorities set forth in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of whether any party hereto in the future seeks to rescind, amend, terminate or reform, by liquidation or otherwise, its respective agreements with Borrower.

^**Remedies**. In the event of the commencement of foreclosure or similar action by any of the parties hereto with respect to Collateral, the parties hereto agree to cooperate with each other in the exercise of their respective remedies, including, without limitation, rights of entry to premises upon which the Collateral is located. If any party to this Agreement shall be in possession of any Collateral subject to its lien and security interest after having had the indebtedness and other obligations due to it paid in full, it shall deliver (unless otherwise restricted by law and subject in all events to the receipt of an indemnification of all liabilities arising from such delivery) or surrender possession of the same to the other parties hereto as such other parties may be entitled thereto in accordance with the priorities established pursuant to this Agreement, without recourse or warranty.

^**Waiver of Marshalling**. Each party to this Agreement hereby waives any right to require the other parties to marshal any of the Collateral or any other security they may have or otherwise to compel the other parties to seek recourse against or satisfaction of the indebtedness owed to them from one source before seeking recourse or satisfaction from another source.

^**Relation of Parties**. This Agreement is entered into solely for the purposes set forth in the Recitals above, and, except as is expressly otherwise provided herein, none of the parties to this Agreement assumes any responsibility to the other parties to advise such other parties of information known to such party regarding the financial condition of Borrower or regarding the Collateral or of any other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the obligations of Borrower to the parties hereto. Each party shall be responsible for managing its relationship with Borrower and none of the parties shall be deemed to be th e agent of any other party for any purpose. Each of the parties hereto may alter, amend, supplement, release, discharge or otherwise modify any terms of the documents evidencing and embodying their respective rights to payment from Borrower without notice to or consent of the other parties.

^**Notices**. Any notice required or permitted in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be made by hand delivery, by Federal Express, or other similar overnight delivery service, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the parties at the appropriate address set forth below or to such other address as may be hereafter specified by written notice by the parties and shall be considered given as of the date of hand delivery, one (1) calendar day after delivery to Federal Express or similar overnight delivery service, or two (2) calendar days after the date of mailing, independent of the date of mail delivery or whether mail delivery is ever in fact accomplished, as the case may be:
