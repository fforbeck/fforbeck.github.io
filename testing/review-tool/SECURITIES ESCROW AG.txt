Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock, par value $.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and one warrant (“Warrant”), each Warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock, all as more fully described in the Company’s definitive Prospectus, dated May [__], 2010 (“Prospectus”) comprising part of the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-163134) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Registration Statement”), declared effective on May [__], 2010 (the “Effective Date”);

WHEREAS, the Initial Stockholder has agreed, as a condition of the Underwriters’ obligation to purchase the Units pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and to offer them to the public, to deposit all of its shares of Common Stock, as set forth opposite its name on Exhibit A attached hereto, in aggregate [[Shares 1: Number]] shares (83,333 of which are subject to forfeiture to the extent the over-allotment option is not exercised in full) (the “Escrow Shares”), in escrow as hereinafter provided;

WHEREAS, the Company has entered into an amended and restated Warrant Subscription Agreement with Holdings and the Underwriter Warrantholders (collectively, the “Initial Warrantholders”), dated [[Date 1: Date]] (the “Subscription Agreement”), pursuant to which the Initial Warrantholders have agreed to purchase 3,700,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) in a private placement transaction;

WHEREAS, the Company and the Initial Stockholder and Initial Warrantholders desire that the Escrow Agent accept the Escrow Securities, in escrow, to be held and disbursed as hereinafter provided.

IT IS AGREED:  
^**Appointment of Escrow Agent**. The Company, the Initial Stockholder and Initial Warrantholders hereby appoint the Escrow Agent to act in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to act in accordance with and subject to such terms.

^**Deposit of Escrow Securities**. On or before the Effective Date, the Initial Stockholder and Initial Warrantholders shall deliver to the Escrow Agent certificates representing their respective Escrow Securities, in proper transfer order with Medallion guaranteed stock powers, to be held and disbursed subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Initial Stockholder and Initial Warrantholders acknowledge and agree that the certificates representing the Escrow Securities will bear a legend to reflect the deposit of such Escrow Securities under this Agreement.

^**Disbursement of the Escrow Securities**. The Escrow Agent shall hold each of the Escrow Shares and the Private Warrants until the termination of their respective Escrow Period (as defined below). In the case of the Escrow Shares, the “Escrow Period” shall be the period beginning on the date the certificates representing the Shares are deposited with the Escrow Agent and ending on the date that is one year following the consummation of the initial Business Transaction (as such term is defined in the Registration Statement) or earlier if, subsequent to the Business Transaction the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Common Stock for cash, securities or other property. In the case of the Private Warrants, the “Escrow Period” shall be the period beginning on the date the certificates representing the Private Warrants are deposited with the Escrow Agent and ending 30 days following the date of the consummation of the initial Business Transaction. On the termination date of the applicable Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent shall, upon written instructions from the Company, disburse the Escrow Securities to such holders; provided, however, that if the Escrow Agent is notified by the Company pursuant to Section 6.7 hereof that the Company is (i) being liquidated at any time during the Escrow Period, or (ii) that up to 83,333 of the Escrow Shares have been forfeited, then the Escrow Agent shall promptly destroy the certificates representing such Escrow Securities (or portion thereof, as applicable). The Escrow Agent shall have no further duties hereunder after the disbursement or destruction of the Escrow Securities in accordance with this Section 3.

^**Rights of Initial Holder in Escrow Securities**.

^^**Voting Rights as a Stockholder**. Subject to the terms of the Insider Letter described in Section 4.4 hereof and except as herein provided, the Initial Stockholder shall retain all of its rights as a stockholder of the Company during the Escrow Period, including, without limitation, the right to vote the Escrow Shares.

^^**Dividends and Other Distributions in Respect of the Escrow Securities**. During the Escrow Period, all dividends payable in cash with respect to the Escrow Securities shall be paid to the Initial Stockholder, but all dividends payable in stock or other non-cash property (“Non-Cash Dividends”) shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent to hold in accordance with the terms hereof. As used herein, the term “Escrow Securities” shall be deemed to include the Non-Cash Dividends distributed thereon, if any.

^^**Restrictions on Transfer**. During the Escrow Period, no sale, transfer or other disposition may be made of any or all of the Escrow Securities except (i) upon the dissolution and liquidation of holder and the distribution of assets to its members; (ii) by gift to an immediate family member of any Initial Stockholder or the Initial Warrantholders members or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is an immediate family member of such Initial Stockholder or a member of the immediate family of the Initial Warrantholders’ members, (iii) by virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon death of any Initial Stockholder or any member of an Initial Warrantholder, (iv) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (v) in the event of the Company’s liquidation prior to completion of its initial Business Transaction or (vi) in the event of the Company’s consummation of a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property subsequent to the Company’s consummation of an initial Business Transaction; provided, however, that such permissive transfers may be implemented only upon the respective transferee’s written agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the Insider Letter signed by the Initial Stockholder that is transferring the Escrow Shares. Even if transferred in accordance with this Section 4.3, the Escrow Securities will remain subject to this agreement and may be released from escrow only in accordance with Section 3 hereof. During the Escrow Period, the Initial Stockholder shall not pledge or grant a security interest in the Escrow Securities or grant a security interest in its rights under this Agreement.
