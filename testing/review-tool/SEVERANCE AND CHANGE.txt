^^Other Plans and Policies. The termination benefits described in Sections 4.1 through 4.4 are in lieu of any termination benefits that the Executive might otherwise be entitled to receive from the Company under any of the Company’s applicable severance pay policies; provided, however, to the extent the Executive participates in any annual bonus, long-term incentive, equity award, or similar plan or program, the Executive’s rights upon a Termination of Employment under such plans or programs shall be determined under the documents or agreements governing said plans or programs. 

Except as specified in the preceding paragraph, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive’s continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its Affiliates and for which the Executive is eligible, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any agreement entered into after the date hereof with the Company or any of its Affiliates. Subject to the foregoing, amounts which are vested benefits, or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or program of, or agreement entered into after the date hereof with the Company or any of its Affiliates at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice, program or agreement, except as may be explicitly governed otherwise by this Agreement. 

^^Code Section 409A. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article IV, to the extent required by Code Section 409A, payment to the Executive if he is a “specified employee” (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i)) shall not be made before the date which is six (6) months and one (1) day after the date of the Executive’s separation from service (within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i)) or, if earlier, the date of death of the Executive, except to the extent the payments are (i) made by reason of involuntary termination of employment by the Company without Cause or a termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company for Good Reason and (ii) do not exceed the Basic Severance Limitation. 

^^For purposes of this Section the “Basic Severance Limitation” means two (2) times the lesser of (i) the sum of the Executive’s annualized compensation based on the annual rate of pay for services provided to the Company for the taxable year of the Executive preceding the taxable year in which the Executive’s employment terminated (adjusted for any increase during that taxable year that was expected to continue indefinitely if the Executive had not incurred a termination of employment) or (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Code Section 401(a)(17) for the year of the Executive’s termination of employment. 

^^If this Section 4.6 applies, then (i) any lump sum payment otherwise required (a “Required Lump Sum”) shall first be made when due up to the Basic Severance Limitation; (ii) any Required Lump Sum that exceeds the Basic Severance Limitation shall be paid in a single lump sum on the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the Date of Termination; (iii) any installment payments otherwise required (“Required Installments”) shall be paid in equal monthly installments during the six (6) month period up to an aggregate amount that (together with any Required Lump Sum paid during the six (6) month period) is not in excess of the Basic Severance Limitation, and (iv) the remaining amount of any Required Installments that would have been paid during the six (6) month period but for the application of the Basic Severance Limitation shall be paid (without interest) in a lump sum on the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the Date of Termination, and the remaining Required Installments shall be paid over the remainder of the applicable installment period. 

^^Bonus. If within the Contract Term (a) there occurs a Change of Control and (b) within a twelve (12) month period subsequent to the Change of Control the Company terminates the employment of the Executive without Cause (other than for death or Disability) or the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason (other than for death or Disability), the Executive shall be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of the Executive’s annual bonus (“Pro Rata Bonus”) for such fiscal year based on the number of days the Executive has been employed with the Company in such fiscal year prior to the Date of Termination. This Pro Rata Bonus shall only be paid if the Executive has satisfied any and all requirements for such annual bonus as such requirements may be proportionally decreased for the stub year period. For example only, if the Executive’s annual bonus is $[[USD Value 1: Number]] the Date of Termination is [[Date 3: Date]], and the annual bonus requirement is that the revenues of the Company exceed $[[USD Value 3: Number]] million, then the Executive shall receive a Pro Rata Bonus of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] if the Company’s revenues exceed $[[USD Value 4: Number]] million for the 6-month period ended [[Date 4: Date]]. Such annual bonus shall be paid on the Date of Termination. 

\centered **CONTINGENT LIMITATION ON BENEFITS PAYABLE** 

^^General Rules. 

^^Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement, plan, or arrangement (except as provided in the following paragraph of this Subsection (a)), if any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Executive (under the terms of this Agreement, or any other plan, arrangement, or agreement with the Company, or any other plan, arrangement, or agreement with any person whose actions result in a Change in Control or any person affiliated with the Company or any such person) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter called “Total Payments”) would be subject (in whole or in part) to taxes imposed by 

Code Section 4999, the portion of the Total Payments payable under this Agreement shall be reduced as herein provided. 

The Total Payments payable under this Agreement shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments shall be subject to the parachute excise tax (the “Excise Tax”) imposed by Code Section 4999 (after taking into account any reduction in the Total Payments provided by reason of Code Section 280G in any other plan, arrangement, or agreement) but only if the amount determined under Paragraph (1) below is greater than the amount determined under Paragraph (2) below. 

^The amount determined hereunder shall be the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after deduction of the net amount of Federal, state, and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments computed at Executive’s highest marginal tax rates). 

^The amount determined hereunder shall be: 

^the net amount of such Total Payments, without reduction (but after deduction of the net amount of Federal, state, and local income taxes on such Total Payments computed at Executive’s highest marginal tax rates), further reduced by: 

^the amount of Excise Tax to which the Executive would be subject in respect of such Total Payments. 

Any reduction of the Total Payments, if required, shall be made under one of the two alternative methods described in Subjection (b) below. If a reduction in Total Payment is required for purposes of this Section 5.1 pursuant to the calculations hereunder, Total Payments shall not include any amounts considered a “parachute payment” under Code Section 280G as such determination is made by a national accounting firm or a national law firm, either of which accounting firm or law firm shall be selected by, retained by and perform said services at the expense of the Company. 

^^If the Total Payments all become payable at approximately the same time. 

^Executive’s Monthly Base Salary shall first be reduced (if necessary, to zero); 

^Executive’s participation in Company employee benefit plans shall next be reduced (if necessary, to zero); 

^any other portions of the Total Payments shall next be reduced (if necessary, to zero); and 

^the acceleration of vesting of awards under any equity award plans, annual incentive plans, deferred compensation or similar nonqualified executive compensation arrangements shall be reduced as necessary. 

If the Total Payments do not become due and payable at approximately the same time, the respective Total Payments shall be paid in full in the order in which they become payable, until any portion thereof would be subject to reduction as set forth herein, and such portion (and any subsequent portions) of the Total Payments shall be reduced to zero. In such event, the Company shall make every reasonable effort to make such payments in the order (if possible) that results in the most favorable tax treatment and economic result for Executive. 

^^For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments would be subject to the Excise Tax. 

^no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which the Executive shall have effectively waived in writing prior to the Date of Termination shall be taken into account; 

^no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which in the determination of the aforementioned national accounting firm or national law firm selected by the Company to make such determination does not constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b) (2), including by reason of Code Section 280G(b) (4) (A); 

^in calculating the Excise Tax, the payments shall be reduced only the extent necessary so that the Total Payments in their entirety constitute reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b) (4) or otherwise not subject to disallowance as deductions because of Code Section 280G, in the determination of such national accounting firm or national law firm; and 

^the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by a national accounting firm or national law firm as selected by the Company, in accordance with the principles of Code Section 280G(d) (3) and (4). 

The Company shall provide the Executive with the calculation of the foregoing amounts and any supporting materials as are reasonably necessary for the Executive to evaluate the calculations, however the findings of such national accounting firm or national law firm shall be binding upon the Executive and the Company. 

\centered **SPECIAL ACCELERATION OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS** 

^^Acceleration of Stock Options. If within the Contract Term (a) there occurs a Change of Control and (b) within a twelve (12) month period subsequent to the Change of Control the Company terminates the employment of the Executive without Cause (other than for death or Disability), or the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason (other than for death or Disability), any stock option (“Option”) of the Company awarded to the Executive by the Company prior to, and during, the term of this Agreement, to the extent outstanding at the time but not otherwise fully exercisable, shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall become immediately exercisable for all the Option shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Option shares as fully vested shares. However, the Option shall not become exercisable on such an accelerated basis, if and to the extent: (i) the Option is, in connection with the Change in Control, to be assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or (ii) the Option is to be replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the spread existing at the time of the Change of Control on any Option shares for which the Option is not otherwise at that time exercisable (the excess of the fair market value of the Option shares over the aggregate exercise price payable for such shares) and provides for subsequent payout in accordance with the same option exercise/vesting schedule for those Option shares set forth in the relevant grant notice. 

^^Acceleration of Restricted Stock Units. If within the Contract Term (a) there occurs a Change of Control and (b) within a twelve (12) month period subsequent to the Change of Control the Company terminates the employment of the Executive without Cause (other than for death or Disability), or the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason (other than for death or Disability), any restricted stock units (“Units”) awarded to the Executive by the Company prior to, and during, the term of this Agreement, to the extent outstanding at the time but not otherwise vested, shall automatically vest immediately and the shares subject to such vested Units will be issued immediately. However, the Units shall not become exercisable on such an accelerated basis, if and to the extent: (i) the Units are, in connection with the Change in Control, to be assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or (ii) the Units are to be replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the spread existing at the time of the Change of Control on any Units for which the Units are not otherwise at that time exercisable (the excess of the fair market value of the Units over the aggregate exercise price payable for such shares) and provides for subsequent payout in accordance with the same exercise/vesting schedule for those Units set forth in the relevant grant notice. 

\centered **MISCELLANEOUS** 

^^No Mitigation. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor shall the amount of any payment hereunder be reduced, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, by any compensation earned by the Executive as result of employment by another employer. 

^^Enforcement. 

^^If the Executive incurs legal or other fees and expenses in an effort to establish entitlement to payments and benefits rightfully owing under this Agreement, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for such fees and expenses in the event the Executive is the prevailing party in any civil action or arbitration, or in the event the Company and the Board otherwise determine the Executive is entitled to such payments or benefits, and actually provides said payments or benefits to the Executive. 

^^If Executive does not prevail (after exhaustion of all available judicial remedies), and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Executive had no reasonable basis for bringing an action hereunder or there was an absence of good faith for bringing an action hereunder, no reimbursement for legal fees or other expenses shall be due to the Executive and Executive shall refund to the Company any amounts previously paid hereunder (if any) with respect to such action. 

^^Assignment, Successors. The Company may freely assign its respective rights and obligations under this Agreement to a successor of the Company’s business, without the prior written consent of the Executive. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Executive and the Executive’s estate and the Company and any assignee of or successor to the Company. 

^^Nonalienation of Benefits. Benefits payable under this Agreement shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, prior to actually being received by the Executive, and any such attempt to dispose of any right to benefits payable hereunder shall be void. 

^^Severability. If all or any part of this Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not serve to invalidate any portion of this Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid.
