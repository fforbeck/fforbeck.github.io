\centered **INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT**

This Indemnification Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made as of , 201 by and among [[Company]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (the “Company”) and (the “Indemnitee).

\centered **RECITALS**

The Company desires to attract and retain the services of highly qualified individuals, such as Indemnitee, and to indemnify its directors, officers and key employees so as to provide them with the maximum protection permitted by law.

The Bylaws of the Company (the “Bylaws”) require indemnification of the officers and directors of the Company, and Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”).

The Bylaws and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the board of directors, officers and other persons with respect to indemnification.

The Company and Indemnitee recognize the increasing difficulty in obtaining liability insurance for directors, officers and key employees, the significant increases in the cost of such insurance and the general reductions in the coverage of such insurance.

The Company and Indemnitee further recognize the substantial increase in corporate litigation in general, subjecting directors, officers and key employees to expensive litigation risks at the same time as the availability and coverage of liability insurance has been severely limited.

Indemnitee does not regard the protection currently provided by applicable law, the Company’s governing documents and available insurance as adequate under the present circumstances, and Indemnitee and agents of the Company may not be willing to serve as agents of the Company without additional protection.

The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining highly qualified persons such as Indemnitee is detrimental to the best interests of the Company’s stockholders and that the Company should act to assure Indemnitee that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future.

It is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, regardless of any amendment or revocation of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”) or Bylaws, so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified.

This Agreement is supplemental to and in furtherance of the indemnification provided in the Bylaws and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder.

\centered **AGREEMENT**

In consideration of the mutual promises made in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and Indemnitee hereby agree as follows:

1.**Indemnification.**


^^ \centered (a) **Third Party Proceedings**. The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee if Indemnitee is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened or completed proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or any subsidiary of the Company, by reason of any action or inaction on the part of Indemnitee while an officer or director or by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in each case whether or not serving in such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification, reimbursement or advancement of expenses can be provided under this Agreement (any of the foregoing, a “Proceeding”), other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful. 

^^ \centered (b) **Proceedings By or in the Right of the Company**. The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee if Indemnitee was or is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding by or in right of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company to procure a judgment in the Company’s favor, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), in each case to the extent actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, except that no indemnification shall have been made in respect of any claim, issue 
^^ \centered    


^^ \centered or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been finally adjudicated by court order or judgment to be liable to the Company in the performance of Indemnitee’s duty to the Company and its stockholders unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or proceeding is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper. 

^^ \centered (c) **Mandatory Payment of Expenses**. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 1(a) or Section 1(b) or the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee’s behalf in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all expenses (including attorney’s fees) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee’s behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter. For purposes of this Section 1(c) and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter. 

^^ \centered (d) **Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness**. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his status as a current or former director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of the Company or of any other enterprise which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party and is not threatened to be made a party, he shall be indemnified against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. 

2.**Contribution.**

^^ \centered (a) Whether or not the indemnification provided in Section 1 above is available, in respect of any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), the Company shall pay, in the first instance, the entire amount of any judgment or settlement of such Proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to contribute to such payment and the Company hereby waives and relinquishes any right of contribution it may have against Indemnitee. The Company shall not enter into any settlement of any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding) unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all claims asserted against Indemnitee. 

^^ \centered (b) Without diminishing or impairing the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 2(a) above, if, for any reason, Indemnitee shall elect or be required to pay all or any portion of any judgment or settlement in any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), the Company shall contribute to the amount of expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in 
^^ \centered    


^^ \centered settlement actually and reasonably incurred and paid or payable by Indemnitee in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, from the transaction from which such Proceeding arose; provided, however, that the proportion determined on the basis of relative benefit may, to the extent necessary to conform to law, be further adjusted by reference to the relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company other than Indemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, in connection with the events that resulted in such expenses, judgments, fines or settlement amounts, as well as any other equitable considerations which the law may require to be considered. The relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the degree to which their actions were motivated by intent to gain personal profit or advantage, the degree to which their liability is primary or secondary and the degree to which their conduct is active or passive. 

^^ \centered (c) The Company hereby agrees to fully indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless from any claims of contribution which may be brought by officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee. 

^^ \centered (d) To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for expenses (including attorneys’ fees), in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding; and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or transaction(s). 

3.**No Employment Rights.** Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to create in Indemnitee any right to continued employment. The foregoing notwithstanding, this Agreement shall continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company.

4.**Expenses; Indemnification Procedure.**

^^ \centered (a) **Advancement of Expenses**. The Company shall advance all expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of any Proceeding referred to in Section 1 hereof (including, but not limited to, amounts actually paid in settlement of any such Proceeding and, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, payments to the Indemnitee (to the extent such Indemnitee is not an employee of the Company) of an hourly fee of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] per hour for each hour spent by the Indemnitee in investigating, defending    

^^ \centered against, being a witness in, participating in, or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in, any such Proceeding). Advances shall be unsecured and interest free. Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee’s ability to repay the expenses and without regard to Indemnitee’s ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this Agreement. Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution and delivery to the Company of this Agreement and Indemnitee hereby undertakes to the fullest extent required by law to repay such amounts advanced only if, and to the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment, not subject to appeal, that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized hereby. The right to advances under this paragraph shall in all events continue until final disposition of any Proceeding, including any appeal therein. Nothing in this Section 4(a) shall limit Indemnitee’s right to advancement of Enforcement Expenses pursuant to Section 4(c). 

^^ \centered In addition, in the event that a Change of Control (as defined below) has occurred, the Company shall, upon the request of the Indemnitee, deposit in an escrow account with a financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee an amount equal to the expenses reasonably projected by counsel to the Indemnitee to be incurred over the next six months in connection with defending, or investigating or preparing to defend, any Proceeding then pending with respect to which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses, and shall, from time to time upon request of the Indemnitee replenish the amount of such escrow deposit so that, after the date of such additional deposit, the amount of such escrow account is at least equal to such reasonably projected expenses over the ensuing six month period. For purpose of this Section 4(a), a “Change of Control” shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any “person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) (other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or a corporation owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company), is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing [[Percentage 1: Number]]% or more of the total voting power represented by the Company’s then outstanding Voting Securities (as defined below); or (ii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director whose election by the Board of Directors or nomination for election by the Company’s stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; or (iii) there is a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the Voting Securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into Voting Securities of the surviving entity) at least [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the total voting power represented by the Voting Securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or there is a complete liquidation of the Company or a sale or disposition by the Company of (in one transaction or a series of transactions) all or substantially all the Company’s assets. The term “Voting Securities” means any securities of the Company that vote generally in the election of directors.    

^^ \centered (b) **Notice/Cooperation by Indemnitee**. Indemnitee shall give the Company notice in writing as soon as practicable of any claim made against Indemnitee for which indemnification will or could be sought under this Agreement. Failure of the Indemnitee to give the Company notice of any claim made against Indemnitee for which indemnification will or could be sought under this Agreement shall not prevent Indemnitee from obtaining indemnification and advancement of expenses hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the extent) failure to give such notice has increased the damages to the Company hereunder. Notice to the Company shall be directed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and shall be given in accordance with the provisions of Section 15(d) below. In addition, Indemnitee shall give the Company such information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as shall reasonably be within Indemnitee’s power. 

^^ \centered (c) **Procedure**. Any indemnification and advances provided for in this Agreement shall be made no later than twenty (20) days after receipt of the written request of Indemnitee. If a claim under this Agreement, under any statute, or under any provision of the Charter or Bylaws providing for indemnification, is not paid in full by the Company within twenty (20) days after a written request for payment thereof has first been received by the Company, Indemnitee may, but need not, at any time thereafter bring an action against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, subject to Section 13 of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid for the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) of bringing such action (such expenses, “Enforcement Expenses”), regardless of whether Indemnitee is ultimately determined to be entitled to such indemnification or advances. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4(c), the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement, as the case may be. The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4(c) that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding in advance of its final disposition) that Indemnitee has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under applicable law for the Company to indemnify Indemnitee for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Company and Indemnitee shall be entitled to receive interim payments of expenses pursuant to Section 4(a) unless and until such defense may be finally adjudicated by court order or judgment from which no further right of appeal exists. It is the parties’ intention that if the Company contests Indemnitee’s right to indemnification, the question of Indemnitee’s right to indemnification shall be for the court to decide, and neither the failure of the Company (including the Board, any committee or subgroup of the Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination that indemnification of Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct required by applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Company (including the Board, any committee or subgroup of the Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that Indemnitee has or has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if the Indemnitee’s action is based on the records or books of account of the Company, including financial statements, or on information supplied to the Indemnitee by the officers of the Company in the course of their duties, or on the    

^^ \centered advice of legal counsel for the Company or on information or records given or reports made to the Company by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Company. In addition, the knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, or of any officer, agent or employee of the Company shall not be imputed to the Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement. Whether or not the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(c) are satisfied, it shall in any event be presumed that the Indemnitee has at all times acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof. 

^^ \centered (d) Notice to Insurers. To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees, agents or trustees of the Company, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such director, officer, employee, agent or trustee under such policy or policies. If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies. 

^^ \centered (d) **Selection of Counsel**. In the event the Company shall be obligated under Section 4(a) hereof to pay the expenses of any Proceeding against Indemnitee, the Company, if appropriate, shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Proceeding, with counsel approved by Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of its election so to do. After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of counsel subsequently incurred by Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding, provided that (i) Indemnitee shall have the right to employ counsel in any such proceeding at Indemnitee’s expense; and (ii) if (A) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the Company, (B) Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense or (C) the Company shall not, in fact, have employed counsel to assume the defense of such proceeding then the fees and expenses of Indemnitee’s counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. 

^**Additional Indemnification Rights: Nonexclusivitv.**

^^ \centered (a) **Scope**. Notwithstanding any other provision of his Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify the Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, notwithstanding that such indemnification is not specifically authorized by the other provisions of this Agreement, the Charter, the Bylaws or by statute. In the event of any change, after the date of this Agreement, in any applicable law, statute, or rule which expands the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its board of directors or an officer, such changes shall be deemed to be within the purview of Indemnitee’s rights and the Company’s obligations under this Agreement. In the event of any change in any applicable law, statute or rule which    

^^ \centered narrows the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its board of directors or an officer, such changes, to the extent not otherwise required by such law, statute or rule to be applied to this Agreement shall have no effect on this Agreement or the parties’ rights and obligations hereunder. 

^^ \centered (b) **Nonexclusivitv**. The indemnification provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any rights to which Indemnitee may be entitled under the Charter, the Bylaws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested members of the Board, the DGCL, or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitee’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. The indemnification provided under this Agreement shall continue as to Indemnitee for any action taken or not taken while serving in an indemnified capacity even though he or she may have ceased to serve in any such capacity at the time of any covered Proceeding. 

6.**Partial Indemnification.** If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the expenses, judgments, fines or penalties actually or reasonably incurred in the investigation, defense, appeal or settlement of any Proceeding, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses, judgments, fines or penalties to which Indemnitee is entitled.

7.**Mutual Acknowledgment.**Both the Company and Indemnitee acknowledge that in certain instances, Federal law or public policy may override applicable state law and prohibit the Company from indemnifying its directors and officers under this Agreement or otherwise. For example, the Company and Indemnitee acknowledge that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has taken the position that indemnification is not permissible for liabilities arising under certain federal securities laws, and federal legislation prohibits indemnification for certain ERISA violations. Indemnitee understands and acknowledges that the Company has undertaken or may be required in the future to undertake with the SEC to submit the question of indemnification to a court in certain circumstances for a determination of the Company’s right under public policy to indemnify Indemnitee.

8.**Officer and Director Liability Insurance.**For so long as Indemnitee serves on the Board, the Company shall continue in effect, and take all reasonable action necessary to maintain and provide, “directors and officers” insurance with coverage levels at least as great as those in effect immediately prior to the date hereof and covering the Indemnitee; provided, that the Company may adjust and/or reduce such coverage levels from time to time with the prior approval of two-thirds (2/3rds) of the directors. In all policies of director and officer liability insurance, Indemnnitee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Company’s directors, if Indemnitee is a director, or of the Company’s officers, if Indemnitee is not a director of the Company but is an officer, or of the Company’s key employees, if Indemnitee is not an officer or director but is a key employee.

9.**Severability.**Nothing in this Agreement is intended to require or shall be construed as requiring the Company to do or fail to do any act in violation of applicable law. The Company’s inability, pursuant to court order, to perform its obligations under this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement is intended to confer upon Indemnitee indemnification rights to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws. The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable as provided in this Section 9. If this Agreement or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then (a) such invalidated provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto, (b) the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto, and (c) the balance of this Agreement not so invalidated shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

^Coordination with Other Rights to Indemnification.

The Company acknowledges that the Indemnitee may be employed by, otherwise affiliated with, or appointed by, another person or entity, and may be entitled to, or may be provided, indemnification by such other person or entity (the “Third Party Indemnitor”) or its Affiliates (as defined below) for certain expenses and liabilities for which the Indemnitee may also be entitled to seek indemnification from the Company pursuant to this Agreement, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, or otherwise (the “Company Indemnified Expenses”). The Company acknowledges and agrees that, as between the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Third Party Indemnitor and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries), on the other hand, the Company shall be primarily liable to the Indemnitee with respect to any Company Indemnified Expenses and any liability of the Third Party Indemnitor or its Affiliates to the Indemnitee shall be secondary liability. In recognition of the primary liability of the Company, the Company agrees that, in the event that the Third Party Indemnitor or any of its Affiliates pays any Company Indemnified Expenses to and on behalf of the Indemnitee, reimburses the Indemnitee for any Company Indemnified Expenses paid by the Indemittee or advances amounts to the Indemnitee (including by way of any loan) for the payment of Company Indemnified Expenses, then (i) the Company shall pay to the Third Party Indemnitor any amounts so paid, reimbursed or advanced, to the extent that the Indemnitee would have been entitled to indemnification of such Company Indemnified Expenses and (ii) the Third Party Indemnitor shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the Indemnitee with respect to any claim that the Indemnitee could have brought against the Company or any subsidiary with respect to any Company Indemnified Expenses that have been paid, reimbursed or advanced to or on behalf of the Indemnitee. All such payments to the Third Party Indemnitor shall be made within twenty (20) days of the receipt by the Company of written notice from the Third Party Indemnitor of such payment, reimbursement or advance, accompanied by documentation showing, in reasonable detail, the Company Indemnified Expenses so paid, reimbursed or advanced by the Third Party Indemnitor or any or its Affiliates. The Company shall also reimburse the Third Party Indemnitor and its Affiliates for all expenses, including legal expenses, incurred in enforcing this Section 10.

For purposes of this Section 10, “Affiliate” means, with respect to any specified person or entity, such other person or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such specified person or entity. For purposes of the foregoing definition, “control,” when used with respect to any specified person or entity, means the power to direct the management and policies of such person or entity, directly or indirectly, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms “controlling” and “controlled” have meanings correlative to the foregoing.

^Exceptions. Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:

^^ \centered (a) **Claims Initiated by Indemnitee**. To indemnify or advance expenses to Indemnitee with respect to proceedings or claims initiated or brought voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by way of defense, except with respect to (i) proceedings brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under this Agreement or any other statute or law or otherwise as required under Section 145 of the DGCL or (ii) any proceeding that is a counterclaim brought in connection with a proceeding initiated against the Indemnitee and such counterclaim is either a mandatory counterclaim or is defensive in nature, but such indemnification or advancement of expenses may be provided by the Company in specific cases if the Board of Directors finds it to be appropriate; 

^^ \centered (b) **Lack of Good Faith**. To indemnify Indemnitee for any expenses incurred by Indemnitee with respect to any proceeding instituted by Indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines that each of the material assertions made by Indemnitee in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous; 

^^ \centered (c) **Insured Claims**. To indemnify Indemnitee for expenses or liabilities of any type whatsoever (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid in settlement) to the extent such expenses or liabilities have been paid directly to Indemnitee by an insurance carrier under a policy of officers’ and directors’ liability insurance maintained by the Company; or 

^^ \centered (d) **Claims under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or Section 304 or 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act**. To indemnify Indemnitee on account of any suit in which judgment is rendered against the Indemnitee for (i) disgorgement of profits made from the purchase or sale by the Indemnitee of securities of the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or similar provisions of any federal, state or local statutory law or (ii) any reimbursement of the Company by the Indemnitee of any bonus or other incentive-based compensation or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by the Indemnitee from the sale of securities of the Company, in each case pursuant to Section 304 or 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act adopted pursuant thereto. 

^Construction of Certain Phrases. For purposes of this Agreement references to the “Company” shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employee or agents, so that if Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture; trust or other enterprise, Indemnitee shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Agreement with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as Indemnitee would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.


^^ \centered (b) For purposes of this Agreement, references to “other enterprises” shall include employee benefit plans; references to “fines” shall include any excise taxes assessed on Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to “serving at the request of the Company” shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the Company” as referred to in this Agreement.  
^Attorneys’ Fees. In the event that any action is instituted by Indemnitee under this Agreement to enforce or interpret any of the terms hereof, Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid all court costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by Indemnitee with respect to such action, unless as a part of such action, the court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by Indemnitee as a basis for such action were not made in good faith or were frivolous.
