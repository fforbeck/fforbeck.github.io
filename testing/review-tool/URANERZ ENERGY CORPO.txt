The Company agrees that, from time to time during the term of this Agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, it may issue and sell through the Agent, acting as agent, shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $[[USD Value 5: Number]] per share (the “**Common Stock**”), having an aggregate offering price of up to US$[[USD Value 1]] (the “**Shares**”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties hereto agree that compliance with the limitations set forth in this **Section** and any limitations imposed by applicable laws or regulations on the number of Shares issued and sold under this Agreement shall be the sole responsibility of the Company, and the Agent shall have no obligation in connection with such compliance. The issuance and sale of Shares through the Agent will be effected pursuant to the Registration Statement (as defined below) filed by the Company and declared effective by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “**Commission**”).

^**Placements**. Each time that the Company wishes to issue and sell Shares hereunder (each, a “**Placement**”), it will notify the Agent by e-mail notice (or other method mutually agreed to in writing by the parties) containing the parameters in accordance with which it desires the Shares to be sold, which shall, at a minimum, include the number of Shares to be issued (the “**Placement Shares**”), the time period during which sales are requested to be made, any limitation on the number of Placement Shares that may be sold in any one day and any minimum price below which sales may not be made and the discount, commission or other compensation to be paid by the Company to the Agent (a “**Placement Notice**”), a form of which, containing such minimum sales parameters necessary, is attached hereto as **Schedule 1**. The Placement Notice shall originate from any of the individuals from the Company set forth on **Schedule 2** (with a copy to each of the other individuals from the Company listed on such schedule), and shall be addressed to each of the individuals from the Agent set forth on **Schedule 2**, as such **Schedule 2** may be amended from time to time. The Placement Notice shall be effective upon receipt by the Agent unless and until (i) in accordance with the notice requirement set forth in **Section** , the Agent declines to accept the terms contained therein for any reason, in its sole discretion, (ii) the aggregate number of Placement Shares sold hereunder have been sold in an amount equal to the aggregate offering price of Placement Shares set forth in Section 1, (iii) in accordance with the notice requirements set forth in **Section** , the Company suspends or terminates the Placement Notice, (iv) the Company issues a subsequent Placement Notice with parameters superseding those on the earlier dated Placement Notice, or (v) the Agreement has been terminated under the provisions of Section 11. It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that neither the Company nor the Agent will have any obligation whatsoever with respect to a Placement or any Placement Shares unless and until the Company delivers a Placement Notice to the Agent and the Agent does not decline, within the time period specified in **Section** , such Placement Notice pursuant to the terms set forth above, and then only upon the terms specified therein and herein. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Placement Notice, the terms of the Placement Notice will control.

The compensation payable to the Agent for sales of Placement Shares with respect to which the Agent acts as sales agent shall be equal to [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the gross sales price of the Placement Shares for amounts of Placement Shares sold pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent’s compensation may increase to [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the gross sales price of Placement Shares sold for certain sales upon the agreement in the parties, which agreement may be set forth in a Placement Notice.

^**Sale of Placement Shares by the Agent**.

^^Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, upon the Company’s issuance of a Placement Notice, and unless the sale of the Placement Shares described therein has been declined, suspended or otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Agent, for the period specified in the Placement Notice, will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell such Placement Shares up to the amount specified, and otherwise in accordance with the terms of such Placement Notice. The Agent will provide written confirmation to the Company no later than the opening of the Trading Day (as defined below) immediately following the Trading Day on which it has made sales of Placement Shares hereunder setting forth the number of Placement Shares sold on such day, the compensation payable by the Company with respect to such sales, with an itemization of deductions made by the Agent (as set forth in **Section** [**5(a)**](#_Ref195328306)) from the gross proceeds that it receives from such sales, and the Net Proceeds (as defined below) payable to the Company.

^^The Agent hereby covenants and agrees not to make any sales of the Placement Shares on behalf of the Company, pursuant to this Agreement, other than by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, including without limitation sales made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions between members of the NYSE Amex LLC (the “**Exchange**”) that qualify for delivery of a Prospectus (as defined in **Section 6(a)** below) to the Exchange in accordance with Rule 153 under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the “**Securities Act**”), (such transactions are hereinafter referred to as “**At the Market Offerings**”) For greater certainty, no Placement Shares will be sold on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “**TSX**”) or on other trading markets in Canada.

^^The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) there can be no assurance that the Agent will be successful in selling Placement Shares and (ii) the Agent will not incur any liability or obligation to the Company or any other person or entity if it does not sell Placement Shares for any reason other than a failure by the Agent to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell such Placement Shares as required under this **Section** . For the purposes hereof, “**Trading Day**” means any day on which Shares are purchased and sold on the principal exchange or market in the United States on which the Shares are listed or quoted.

^^The Company shall provide the Agent with a copy of its policy on insider trading (“**Insider Trading Policy**”) and advise the Agent in writing of any changes thereto. Subject to the limitations set forth herein and as may be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Agent, sales pursuant to this Agreement may not be requested by the Company and need not be made by the Agent except during the period that begins after the filing of a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual report on Form 10-K as of and within the period required by the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the “**Exchange Act**”)(each such date, a “**Filing Date**”) and ends, for all periods, on the earlier of (i) the date directors and officers are no longer permitted to trade pursuant to the Company’s Insider Trading Policy as in effect from time to time and (ii) (A) 15 calendar days after the end of the quarter in which the Filing Date with respect to a 10-Q filing occurs or (B) 20 calendar days after the end of the quarter in which the Filing Date with respect to a 10-K occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written consent of each of the Company and the Agent, no sales of Placement Shares shall take place, and the Company shall not request the sale of any Placement Shares that would be sold, and the Agent shall not be obligated to sell, during any period in which the Company is or could be deemed to be, in possession of material non-public information; provided, that, unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Agent, for purposes of this **Section 3(d)**, such period shall be deemed to end on the date on which the Company’s next subsequent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as the case may be, is filed with the Commission.

^^Under no circumstances shall the aggregate offering price or number, as the case may be, of Placement Shares sold pursuant to this Agreement exceed the aggregate offering price or number, as the case may be, of Shares (i) set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement, (ii) available for issuance under the Prospectus, the then-currently effective Registration Statement and any applicable limitation imposed under Canadian Securities Laws (as defined in Section 6(b**)**, below ),or(iii) authorized from time to time to be issued and sold under this Agreement by the Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, and notified to the Agent in writing.

^**Suspension of Sales**. The Company or the Agent may, upon notice to the other party in writing (including by e-mail correspondence to all of the individuals of the other party set forth on **Schedule 2** or by telephone (confirmed immediately by verifiable facsimile transmission or e-mail correspondence to all of the individuals of the other party set forth on **Schedule 2**)), suspend or refuse to undertake any sale of Placement Shares for a period of time (“**Suspension Period**”); provided, however, that such suspension or refusal shall not affect or impair either party’s obligations with respect to any Placement Shares sold hereunder prior to the receipt of such notice. Each of the parties hereto agrees that no such notice shall be effective against the other unless it is made to the individuals named on **Schedule 2** hereto in accordance with this **Section** , as such Schedule may be amended from time to time. During a Suspension Period, the Company shall not issue any Placement Notices and the Placement Agent shall not sell any Placement Shares hereunder. A Suspension Period shall end three Trading Days after the Party which issued the Suspension Notice notifies the other in writing that it wishes to end Suspension Period, or such earlier time as agreed between the Company and the Agent.

^**Settlement**.  

^^**Settlement of Placement Shares**. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Placement Notice, settlement for sales of Placement Shares will occur on the third (3rd) Trading Day (or such earlier day as is industry practice for regular-way trading) following the date on which such sales are made (each, a “**Settlement Date**”). The amount of proceeds to be delivered to the Company on a Settlement Date against the receipt of the Placement Shares sold (the “**Net Proceeds**”) will be equal to the aggregate sales price at which such Placement Shares were sold, after deduction for (i) the Agent’s commission, discount or other compensation for such sales payable by the Company pursuant to **Section** hereof and (ii) any transaction fees imposed by any governmental or self-regulatory organization in respect of such sales.

The Company has good and marketable title to all real property and good and marketable title to all personal property owned by them, in each case free and clear of any and all Liens except such as are described in the Prospectus or such as do not (individually or in the aggregate) materially affect the value of such property or materially interfere with the use made or proposed to be made of such property by the Company; and any real property and buildings held under lease or sublease by the Company are held by it under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases with such exceptions as are not material to, and do not materially interfere with, the use made and proposed to be made of such property and buildings by the Company.

There are no material claims by the Company under any such policy or instrument as to which any insurance company is denying liability or defending under a reservation of rights clause.

There has been no disposal, discharge, emission contamination or other release of any kind at, onto or from any such property or into the environment surrounding any such property of any Hazardous Substances with respect to which the Company has knowledge, except as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has not agreed to assume, undertake or provide indemnification for any liability of any other person under any Environmental Law, including any obligation for cleanup or remedial action, except as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(rr) In the ordinary course of its business, the Company periodically reviews the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Company, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated costs and liabilities (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean−up, closure or remediation of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws, or any permit, license or approval, any related constraints on operating activities and any potential liabilities to third parties). On the basis of such review, the Company has reasonably concluded that such associated costs and liabilities would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

^^The Company will promptly advise the Agent (i) when, during any period that a prospectus relating to the offer or sale of Placement Shares is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any amendment to the Registration Statement affecting the Placement Shares shall have become effective, (ii) of any request by the Commission or Canadian Qualifying Authority for any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Canadian Prospectus, or for any additional information, affecting or in respect of the Placement Shares, (iii) of the issuance by the Commission or Canadian Regulatory Authority of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement affecting the Placement Shares or of any other order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (as such term is defined in Section 433 under the Securities Act) or Canadian Prospectus or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, and (iv) the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Placement Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will prepare and file with the Commission and the Ontario Securities Commission (if required by the MJDS Rule), promptly upon the Agent’s request, any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus that, in the Agent’s reasonable opinion, may be necessary or advisable in connection with the issuance and sale of the Placement Shares by the Agent (provided, however, that the failure of the Agent to make such request shall not relieve the Company of any obligation or liability hereunder, or affect the Agent’s right to rely on the representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement). The Company will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement affecting the Placement Shares or any supplement to the Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus affecting the Placement Shares (except for documents incorporated by reference) unless the Company has furnished the Agent with a copy for its review prior to filing, and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement affecting the Placement Shares to which the Agent reasonably objects, in any event until after the end of the period during which a prospectus is required to be delivered to purchasers of the Placement Shares under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Prospectus Supplement to be transmitted to the Commission for filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act within the time period prescribed. The Company will also cause the Canadian Prospectus Supplement to be filed with the Ontario Securities Commission pursuant to the MJDS Rule. The Company will furnish to the Agent at the time of filing thereof a copy of any document that upon filing is deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus, except for those documents available via EDGAR. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement affecting the Placement Shares or any other order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus, Canadian Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. The Company will timely file the requisite copies of the Prospectus with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) and will advise the Agent of the time and manner of such filing.

^^During any period in which a Prospectus relating to the Placement Shares is required to be delivered by the Agent under the Securities Act with respect to a pending sale of the Placement Shares (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 under the Securities Act), the Company (i) will comply so far as it is able with all requirements imposed upon it by the Securities Act and Canadian Securities Laws, as from time to time in force, so far as necessary to permit the continuance of sales of the Placement Shares during such period in accordance with the provisions hereof and the Prospectus, (ii) will file on or before their respective due dates all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14, 15(d) or any other provision of or under the Exchange Act and (iii) will file with the Commission, the Canadian Qualifying Authorities and the Exchange and the TSX all documents pursuant to the Securities Act and Canadian Securities Laws in the manner and within the time periods required by the Securities Act and Canadian Securities Laws.

^^The Company will use the Net Proceeds as described in the Prospectus.

The requirement to provide a certificate under this **Section 7(j)** shall be waived for any Representation Date occurring during a fiscal quarter during which the Company does not intend to sell Placement Shares prior to the next occurring Representation Date; provided, however, that such waiver shall not apply for any Representation Date on which the Company files its annual report on Form 10−K. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company subsequently decides to sell Placement Shares following a Representation Date when the Company relied on such waiver and did not provide the Agent with a certificate under this **Section 7(j)**, then before the Company delivers the Placement Notice or the Agent sells any Placement Shares, the Company shall provide the Agent with a certificate, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 7(j), dated the date of the Placement Notice.

^^On the date hereof and thereafter as of each Representation Date, the Company shall furnish the Agent with a certificate of its Secretary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

^^At each Applicable Time, each Settlement Date and each Representation Date, the Company shall be deemed to have affirmed each representation and warranty contained in this Agreement. The obligation of the Agent to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the Shares on behalf of the Company as sales agent shall be subject to the continuing accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the continuing satisfaction of the additional conditions specified in Section 3 of this Agreement.

^^Neither the Company nor the Agent (including its agents and representatives, other than the Agent in its capacity as such) will make, use, prepare, authorize, approve or refer to any written communication (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act), required to be filed with the Commission, that constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy Placement Shares hereunder, except by means of the Prospectus or a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus (as defined in Section 20).

^^The Company will comply with all requirements imposed upon it by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Canadian Securities Laws as from time to time in force, so far as necessary to permit the continuance of sales of, or dealings in, the Placement Shares as contemplated by the provisions hereof, the Prospectus and the Canadian Prospectus.

^^The Company will not to sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to sell or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of the Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for the Common Stock or warrants or other rights to purchase the Common Stock or any other securities of the Company that are substantially similar to the Common Stockor permit the registration under the Securities Act of any shares of the Common Stock at any time that sales of the Placement Shares have been made but not settled or at any time the Company has outstanding with the Agent any instructions to sell Placement Shares but such instructions have not been fulfilled or cancelled, in each case without giving the Agent at least three business days’ prior written notice specifying the nature of the proposed sale and the date of such proposed sale. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, without prior notice to the Agent, (i) register the offer and sale of the Placement Shares through the Agent pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) file a registration statement on Form S-8 relating to Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to equity plans described in the Company’s reports filed with the Commission, (iii) issue securities under the Company’s equity compensation plans described in the Company’s reports filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act; and (iv) issue shares upon the conversion of outstanding securities or the exercise of outstanding options or warrants described in the Company’s reports filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act. In the event that notice of a proposed sale is provided by the Company pursuant to this **Section 7(q)**, the Agent may suspend activity under this program for such period of time as may be requested by the Company or as may be deemed appropriate by the Agent.

^^The Company will furnish to the Agent and its counsel (at the expense of the Company) copies of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (including all documents incorporated by reference therein), and all amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement or Prospectus, and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus relating to the registration and issuance of the Placement Shares pursuant to this Agreement that are filed with the Commission during the period in which a prospectus relating to the Placement Shares is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable and in such quantities as the Agent may from time to time reasonably request. In case the Agent is required to deliver a Prospectus relating to the Placement Shares under the Securities Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 under the Securities Act), in connection with the sale of the Placement Shares, a prospectus after the nine-month period referred to in Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act, or after the time a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement is required pursuant to Item 512(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, the Company will prepare, at its expense, promptly upon request and subject to **Section 7(a)** such amendment or amendments to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as may be necessary to permit compliance with the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act or Item 512(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, as the case may be.

^^The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Agent has informed the Company that the Agent may, to the extent permitted under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, purchase and sell Shares for its own account at the same time as Shares are being sold by the Company pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, the Agent will not short the Common Stock for its own account or the account of employees of the Agent during the time when there is an open order for the sale of Placement Shares.

^^If either party has reason to believe that the exemptive provisions set forth in Rule 101(c)(1) of Regulation M under the Exchange Act are not satisfied with respect to the Placement Shares, it shall promptly notify the other party and sales of the Placement Shares under this Agreement shall be suspended until that or other exemptive provisions have been satisfied in the judgment of each party. On or prior to the delivery of a prospectus that is required (whether physically or through compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act or any similar rule) in connection with the offering or sale of the Placement Shares, the Agent and the Company shall each calculate the average daily trading volume (as defined under “ADTV” by Rule 100 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act) of the Shares based on market data provided by Bloomberg L.P. or such other sources as agreed upon by the Agent and the Company.

^^The Company will not, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action designed to cause or result in, or that constitutes or might reasonably be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Placement Shares or (ii) sell, bid for, or purchase the Placement Shares, or pay anyone any compensation for soliciting purchases of the Placement Shares other than the Agent.

^^The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Placement Shares to be listed on the Exchange and the TSX and maintain such listing. The Company will timely file with the Exchange and the TSX all material documents and notices required by the Exchange and the TSX of companies that have or will issue securities that are traded on the Exchange and the TSX.

^^The Company will furnish to the Agent for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement such information as reasonably requested by the Agent regarding the Company.

^^The Company will conduct its affairs in such a manner so as to reasonably ensure that neither it nor its subsidiaries will be or become, at any time prior to the termination of this Agreement, an “investment company,” as such term is defined in the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

^^The Company and its subsidiaries will use their best efforts to comply with all effective applicable provisions of the United States Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

^^During the term of this Agreement, the Company will not enter into another agreement for an At the Market Offering with any other party, other than the Agent.

^**Conditions to the Agent’s Obligations**. The obligations of the Agent hereunder with respect to a Placement will be subject to the continuing accuracy and completeness of the representations and warranties made by the Company herein, to the due performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the continuing satisfaction (or waiver by the Agent in its sole discretion) of the following additional conditions:

^^The Registration Statement shall have become effective and shall be available for the sale of (i) all Placement Shares issued pursuant to all prior Placements and not yet sold by the Agent and (ii) all Placement Shares contemplated to be issued by the Placement Notice relating to such Placement.

^^None of the following events shall have occurred and be continuing: (i) receipt by the Company of any request for additional information from the Commission, a Canadian Qualifying Authority or any other federal or state governmental authority during the period of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the response to which would require any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Canadian Prospectus relating to or affecting the Placement Shares; (ii) the issuance by the Commission, a Canadian Qualifying Authority or any other federal or state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or Canadian Prospectus or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, including any notice objecting to the use of the Registration Statement or Canadian Prospectus having been issued and proceedings therefor initiated, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission or a Canadian Qualifying Authority; (iii) receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Placement Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; (iv) the occurrence of any event that makes any statement made in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus so that, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and, that in the case of the Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and (v) the Company’s reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement would be appropriate.

^^The Agent shall not have advised the Company that the Registration Statement or Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, contains an untrue statement of a material fact regarding the Agent that in the Agent’s opinion is material, or omits to state a fact regarding the Agent that in the Agent’s opinion is material and is required to be stated therein or is necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading.

^^Except as contemplated or disclosed in the Prospectus, there shall not have been any material change, on a consolidated basis, in the authorized capital stock of the Company or any Material Adverse Effect, or any development that may reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect, or a downgrading in or withdrawal of the rating assigned to any of the Company’s securities by any rating organization or a public announcement by any rating organization that it has under surveillance or review its rating of any of the Company’s securities, the effect of which, in the case of any such action by a rating organization described above, in the sole judgment of the Agent (without relieving the Company of any obligation or liability it may otherwise have), is so material as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering of the Placement Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.

^^The Agent shall have received the opinion of Company Counsel, opinion of Canadian Counsel and the Title Opinions required to be delivered pursuant **Section 7(k)** on or before the date on which such delivery of such opinions are required pursuant to **Section 7(k)**.

^^The Agent shall have received the Comfort Letter required to be delivered pursuant **Section 7(l)** on or before the date on which such delivery of such letter or certification is required pursuant to **Section 7(l)**.

^^On each date on which the Company is required to deliver a certificate pursuant to **Section 7(j)**, the Company shall have furnished to the Agent such appropriate further information, certificates and documents as the Agent may reasonably request, including without limitation a certificate of the Secretary of the Company. All such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents will be in compliance with the provisions hereof. The Company will furnish the Agent with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents as the Agent shall reasonably request.

^^All filings with the Commission required by the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act to have been filed prior to the giving of any Placement Notice hereunder shall have been made within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b).

^^The Placement Shares shall have been conditionally approved for listing on the Exchange and the TSX, subject only to notice of issuance and delivery of customary post-issuance documentation, or the Company shall have filed an application for listing of the Placement Shares on the Exchange and the TSX at, or prior to, the issuance of any Placement Notice.

^**Indemnification and Contribution**.  
^^**Indemnification by the Company**. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, its directors, members, officers and each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act as follows:

^against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430A or Rule 424 under the Securities Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any sales material, any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

^against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to **Section 9(e)** below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and

^against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Agent), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (1) or (2) above,

provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), any sales material, or in any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).

^^**Indemnification by the Agent**. The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, trustees, members, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection [(a)](#_Ref195328381) of this Section 9, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). The Company acknowledges that the Agent has not furnished any information to the Company for inclusion in the Prospectus.

^^**Actions against Parties; Notification**. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. Counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected as follows: counsel to the Agent, its directors, members, officers, and each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall be selected by the Agent; counsel to the Company, its directors, trustees, members, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for the Agent and each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for the Company, each of their directors, trustees, members, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel, and the fees and expenses of more than one counsel, in each case in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 9 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

^^**Settlement Without Consent if Failure to Reimburse**. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by **Section 9(a)(2)** effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.

^^**Other Agreements with Respect to Indemnification and Contribution**. The provisions of this Section 9 hereof shall not affect any agreements among the Company with respect to indemnification of each other or contribution between themselves.

^^**Contribution**.  
^If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agent on the other hand from the offering of the Placement Shares pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Agent on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.

^The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agent on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Placement Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the Net Proceeds from the offering of the Placement Shares pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discounts and commissions received by the Agent pursuant to Section 3, bear to the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of Placement Shares pursuant to this Agreement.

^The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agent on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Agent and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

^The Company and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this **Section 9(f)** were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this **Section 9(f)**. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this **Section 9(f)** shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

^Notwithstanding the provisions of this **Section 9(f)**, the Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price of the Placement Shares actually distributed by the Agent exceeds the amount of any damages that the Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

^No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

^For purposes of this **Section 9(f)**, each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contributions as the Agent, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company and each trustee, director or member of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

^^The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the representation and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent, its partners, officers or employees, or any person controlling the Agent, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors and officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, (ii) delivery and acceptance of the Placement Shares and payment therefor, or (iii) any termination of this Agreement. A successor to the Agent or to the Company or its respective directors or officers, or any person controlling the Agent or the Company shall be entitled to the benefits of the indemnity, contribution and reimbursement agreements contained in this Section 9.

^**Representations and Agreements to Survive Delivery**. All representations and warranties of the Company herein or in certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall survive, as of their respective dates, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent, any controlling persons, or the Company (or any of its respective officers, directors or controlling persons), (ii) delivery and acceptance of the Placement Shares and payment therefor or (iii) any termination of this Agreement.

^**Termination**.  

^^The Company shall have the right, by giving notice as hereinafter specified to terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion at any time. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of **Section** [**7(d)**](#_Ref216242488), Section 9, Section 10, Section 15, Section 17 and Section 19 hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such termination.

^^Unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section 11, this Agreement shall automatically terminate when the aggregate number of Placement Shares sold hereunder have been sold in an amount equal to the aggregate offering price of Placement Shares set forth in Section 1. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of **Section** [**7(d)**](#_Ref216242488), Section 9, Section 10, Section 15, Section 17 and Section 19 hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such termination.

^^This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless terminated pursuant to **Sections 11** [(a)](#_Ref195329355), (b) or (c) above or otherwise by mutual agreement of the parties; provided, however, that any such termination by mutual agreement shall in all cases be deemed to provide that **Section** [**7(d)**](#_Ref216242488), Section 9, Section 10, Section 15, Section 17 and Section 19 shall remain in full force and effect.

^^Except as otherwise provided in this Section 11, any termination of this Agreement shall be effective on the date specified in such notice of termination; provided, however, that such termination shall not be effective until the close of business on the date of receipt of such notice by the Agent or the Company, as the case may be.

^The Common Stock currently outstanding is listed on the NYSE Amex, and, based solely on a letter from the NYSE Amex, the Placement Shares are duly authorized for listing on the NYSE Amex.

^To the best of such counsel’s knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no judicial, regulatory or other legal or governmental proceedings pending by or before any court or governmental agency, authority or body to which the Company is a party or of which any property of the Company is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect; and, to the best of such counsel’s knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated.

^The execution, delivery, and performance of the Sales Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and the Prospectus do not and will not (A) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company pursuant to the Material Agreements, (B) violate or conflict with any federal statute, law or regulation, which in our experience is normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Sales Agreement (except we express no opinion as to applicable state securities and blue sky laws) or, (C) to the best knowledge of such counsel, any judgment, decree, order of any court or any judicial, regulatory or other legal or governmental agency or body.

^No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration, filing, qualification, license or permit of or with any court or any judicial, regulatory or other legal or governmental agency or body is required by the Company, which in our experience are normally applicable to the transactions of the type contemplated by the Sales Agreement, except for the anti−fraud provisions of such federal laws, for the execution, delivery and performance of the Sales Agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and the Prospectus, except for (1) such as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws in connection with the offer and sale of the Placement Shares (as to which such counsel need express no opinion), (2) such as have been made or obtained under the Securities Act and (3) such as are required by FINRA.

^The Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, as of their effective date or filing date (other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no opinion need be rendered) complied, and as of the date hereof comply, as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act. The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto (other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no opinion need be rendered) when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable.

^The statements included under the caption “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the Base Prospectus insofar as such statements summarize legal matters discussed therein, are accurate and fair summaries of such legal matters in all material respects.

^The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Placement Shares and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus, will not be, required to register as an “investment company” as such term is defined in the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

^Based solely on a certificate of good standing from the Secretary of State of Wyoming, the Company is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in the State of Wyoming.

^The Registration Statement, and all post-effective amendments thereof, if any, are effective under the Securities Act, and, to the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any post−effective amendment thereof has been issued and no proceedings therefor have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and all filings required by Rule 424(b), Rule 430B and Rule 433 under the Securities Act have been made in the manner and in the time period required therein.

^To the best knowledge of such counsel, no contract or agreement is required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement that is not so filed.

^In addition, such opinion shall also contain a statement that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company, counsel for the Agent and representatives of the Agent at which the contents of the Registration Statement, and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel need not pass upon or assume any responsibility for the factual accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus on the basis of such participation and the information such counsel gained in the course of performing its work in connection with the matters contemplated by the Sales Agreement, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel which lead such counsel to believe that (A) the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective (including the information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B), or any amendment thereof made prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (B) the Prospectus, as of its date (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto made prior to the date hereof as of the date of such amendment or supplement) and as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need express no belief or opinion with respect to the financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or in regard to information in the technical reports referred to in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10−K for the year ended [[Date 16: Date]], which Annual Report is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus ).
