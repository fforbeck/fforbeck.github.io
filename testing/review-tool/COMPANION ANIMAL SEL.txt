This Agreement dated and effective as of [[Date 1: Date]] is made by and between Pfizer Inc, 235 East 42nd Street, [[Address 1: Address]] (hereinafter, “PFIZER”) and MWI Veterinary Supply, [[Address 2: Address]] (hereinafter, “MWI”).

Definitions:

“Products”: Zeniquin, Temaril-P, Antirobe, Doxirobe, Medrol, Dexdomitor, and Antisedan

^PFIZER hereby appoints MWI, and MWI hereby accepts appointment, as a contract distributor for PFIZER’s Products, to purchase from PFIZER and to resell for MWI’s own account as a distributor, subject to the following terms and conditions.

^MWI recognizes and agrees to the following:

^^PFIZER has elected to work with a select group of distributors that are committed to maximizing the sale of the Products and to working closely with PFIZER to identify market opportunities for both companies. The intent of this Agreement is to attain that goal;

^^PFIZER intends to utilize this group of distributors to sell the Products to veterinarians who have and maintain a veterinary/client/patient relationship and who prescribe products for dogs or cats within that relationship, and that PFIZER has, and may in the future, run promotions and other activities that would be seriously prejudiced if MWI resells the Products to non-veterinarians, other distributors, internet pharmacies, human pharmacies or non-employee agents or through brokers.

^Accordingly, MWI shall:

^^use its reasonable best efforts to sell the Products by focusing its efforts at reselling to veterinarians only with a client patient relationship.

^^maintain a full-time outside and inside sales force that will personally and actively solicit sales of the Products and to pay such sales representatives reasonable commission;

^^store and handle its inventory of Products under conditions that will ensure that the Product retains its potency, purity, quality, and identity;

^^cooperate fully with PFIZER by actively participating in such strategy sessions as PFIZER reasonably may require, for the purpose of developing programs to increase use of the Products; and to cooperate fully with PFIZER in implementing all promotions and sales campaigns for the Products;

^^allow PFIZER’s representatives to attend and actively participate in meetings of MWI’s sales representatives;

^^MWI agrees that credit limits established by PFIZER shall be subject to change by PFIZER in its sole discretion and that no shipments will be made to MWI in excess of the established credit limits. MWI will make payment to PFIZER for all Products shipped /**/;

^^take no action, whether or not identified above, that would harm the goodwill of the Products;

^^MWI shall immediately notify PFIZER in the event MWI obtains information indicating that the Products may have to be recalled either by virtue of applicable law or regulation or good business judgment. PFIZER shall control all efforts necessary to conduct any such recall. MWI shall cooperate with PFIZER and MWI agrees to maintain adequate records to conduct such recall, including the name, address and Product purchases of all purchasers of PFIZER Products;

^^^MWI shall not, under any circumstances, be liable for special, collateral, incidental or consequential damages, and PFIZER’s sole remedy for any such damages shall be in accordance with Paragraph 7(e).

^PFIZER shall:

^^sell the Products to MWI at the prices in effect in the then current published PFIZER Animal Health Ethical Distribution Price Memo (hereinafter, “Price List”). PFIZER also shall permit MWI to participate in the distributor incentive programs offered by PFIZER, in accordance with the terms of such programs. PFIZER shall have the unrestricted right to revise the prices, terms and conditions of the Price List, and to add or delete Products or package sizes, without advance notice to MWI, and the revisions shall be effective on all orders submitted after the effective date of the price revisions. In all cases of orders received for other than immediate shipment, the price for the Products shall be that in effect at the time of shipment;

^^retain sole responsibility for the advertising and promotion of the Products and collaborate with MWI in the development of activities appropriate for ethical distribution regarding the Products;

^^compensate MWI in accordance with Exhibits A and B attached hereto. PFIZER shall have the right to audit MWI sales data to confirm appropriate payment in accordance with Exhibits A and B;

^^Allow MWI credit on prepaid returns in accordance with PFIZER’s Outdated Products Policy which is in effect at the time;

^^If MWI has more than one location then MWI must combine purchases of all locations to determine attainment level for incentives. In the event that MWI acquires or combines with another PFIZER agreement holder, the purchase objectives will be adjusted accordingly for the purpose of determining incentives earned;

^^Direct purchase from PFIZER will be used to determine the level of purchases achieved. Any discrepancies must be documented by the Marketing Agreement holder using copies of PFIZER invoices.

^Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit PFIZER’s ability to sell Products to any other party.

^All purchases by MWI pursuant to this Agreement shall be in accordance with the terms of PFIZER’s Pricing and Shipping Policies, as may be amended by PFIZER from time to time. Unless the parties agree otherwise, shipments shall be made to either MWI’s central warehouse point or to branch offices at MWI’s direction.

^The following standard conditions shall apply to all sales under this Agreement:

^^MWI shall cooperate fully with PFIZER in participating fully in the Animal Health Institute Electronic Data Interchange (hereinafter, “AHI EDI”) for the reporting of sales and inventory data on a daily basis. The data to be reported shall be as described in the AHI EDI Transaction sets.

^^all orders are subject to acceptance by PFIZER. Title to the goods shall pass to MWI once they have been properly delivered to the address designated by MWI.

^^any tax or other charge upon the sale and/or shipment of the goods now or hereafter imposed by federal, state or municipal authorities shall be paid by MWI. In the event that the price of any article includes transportation charges, any increase or decrease in transportation charges shall be for MWI’s account;

^^EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, OR IN THE LABELING OF THE PRODUCTS SOLD HEREUNDER, PFIZER MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS;

^^PFIZER shall defend and indemnify MWI from all claims resulting from any breach by PFIZER of the warranties set forth in this paragraph 7 and specifically any claim that the Products, as sold by PFIZER, were defective.

^^in no event shall PFIZER be liable to MWI for special, collateral, incidental, or consequential damages in connection with or arising out of the purchase, resale, or use of the Products. Except as provided under subparagraph 7(e), above, total damages recoverable against PFIZER by MWI shall be exclusively limited to the purchase price of the Products with respect to which damages are claimed;

^^failure of PFIZER to make or of MWI to take, when due, any delivery (or portion thereof) pursuant to an order hereunder, if occasioned by any circumstance or condition beyond the control of the party so failing, shall not subject the failing party to any liability to the other and, at the option of either party, that order or portion thereof not delivered may be canceled;

^^acceptance of MWI’s order by PFIZER is expressly made conditional upon MWI’s acceptance of the conditions of sale as set forth herein, and the prices, terms and conditions of the Price List then in effect, notwithstanding acknowledgment or receipt of MWI’s purchase order containing additional or different provisions, or conflicting oral representations by any agent of PFIZER;

^^^in no event shall MWI be liable to PFIZER for special, collateral, incidental, or consequential damages in connection with or arising out of the purchase, resale, or use of the Products.

CUSTOM MARKETING PROGRAM Funding

MWI may earn up to /**/ for each contract year (Contract Year 2009 and Contract Year 2010) in Custom Marketing Program (“CMP”) funds based on all purchases (Gross less returns) by MWI of PFIZER’s **Zeniquin, Temaril-P, Antirobe, Doxirobe, Medrol, Dexdomitor, and Antisedan** (“Products”).

Programs that use these funds must be discussed in advance with MWI’s PFIZER Account Executive, submitted in writing to PFIZER’s Senior Director of Distribution and approved in writing by PFIZER’s Senior Director of Distribution prior to the start of the program. PFIZER shall have no obligation to pay MWI CMP funds if the parties are unable to agree on the programs to be funded.

^To be eligible for CMP funds, programs must include specific performance metrics and specifics on total CMP funds to be spent in the program and how all CMP funds would be spent. In no event will MWI be eligible to receive CMP funds in excess of /**/ of purchases by MWI from PFIZER of **Zeniquin, Temaril-P, Antirobe, Doxirobe, Medrol, Dexdomitor, and Antisedan** based on their Contract Year 2009 and Contract Year 2010 purchases of **Zeniquin, Temaril-P, Antirobe, Doxirobe, Medrol, Dexdomitor, and Antisedan** from PFIZER.

^While MWI is free to sell Products at such prices and on such terms as MWI agrees with its customers, programs that result in a direct price decrease to the purchaser will not be supported with CMP funds.

^ALL CMP’s REQUIRE PROOF OF PERFORMANCE AND INVOICES AT PROGRAM CONCLUSION. No payment of CMP funds will be made by PFIZER to MWI until all invoices and proof or performance wrap-ups are submitted.

^All program wrap-ups and invoices are to be submitted within 45 days of completion of the program. Wrap ups and invoices for programs that run to year end 2009 should be submitted no later than [[Date 5: Date]] for payment. Any invoices submitted to PFIZER after [[Date 5]] for 2009 programs will be paid out of 2010 CMP funds, at PFIZER’s discretion. Wrap ups and invoices for programs that run to year end 2010 should be submitted no later than [[Date 6: Date]] for payment. Programs will be paid by check or credit memo.
