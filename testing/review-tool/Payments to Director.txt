\centered Payments to Directors 

Torchmark Corporation’s directors are compensated on the following basis: 

^Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company or one of its subsidiaries (Outside Directors) will receive annual cash compensation of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] per year, paid quarterly. This change is effective [[Date 1: Date]] and prorated payments will be made thereunder to Outside Directors in 2010. If a timely advance election is made for 2011 and succeeding years, these directors may elect instead to defer this compensation to an interest-bearing account or to receive an equivalent amount of restricted stock, restricted stock units or market value non-qualified stock options. Fees for attendance at Board and Board Committee meetings ($[[USD Value 2: Number]] for physically-attended meetings and $[[USD Value 8: Number]] for teleconferences) will not be paid after [[Date 1]]. The Outside Directors already do not receive any fees for the execution of written consents in lieu of Board or Board Committee meetings. They do receive reimbursement for their travel and lodging expenses if they do not live in the area where a meeting is held.

^Effective [[Date 1]], the Outside Directors who chair the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee will receive increased annual Committee Chair retainers of $[[USD Value 3: Number]] to the Audit Committee Chair (formerly $[[USD Value 4: Number]]), $[[USD Value 4]] to the Compensation Committee Chair (formerly $[[USD Value 5: Number]]) and $[[USD Value 4]] to the Governance and Nominating Committee Chair (formerly $[[USD Value 5]]), payable in quarterly installments and on a prorated basis for 2010. Also effective [[Date 1]], members of the Audit Committee (including the member serving as the Audit Committee Chair) will receive an annual Audit Committee Member Retainer of $[[USD Value 6: Number]] payable quarterly on a prorated basis for 2010.

^The Outside Director serving as the Lead Director of the Company will receive an additional annual retainer of $[[USD Value 7: Number]] payable in quarterly installments which will be paid on a prorated basis for 2010 service.

^Effective [[Date 2: Date]], Outside Directors will receive annually $[[USD Value 1]] of compensation required to be taken in equity, either in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs) or market value non-qualified stock options, based upon a timely-made advance election. Such stock options, restricted stock and RSUs will become fully exercisable or fully vested, as the case may be, six months from their award date. Restricted stock carries full voting and dividend rights from its initial award date. RSUs, while not issued as shares until a director’s retirement from the Board, carry the right to dividend equivalents from the award date payable in additional RSUs which are fully vested when issued but are also not issued as shares until the director’s retirement. Stock options, which have an exercise price equal to the NYSE market closing price of Company common stock on the grant date, will have a seven year term.

^Directors who are employees of the Company or its subsidiaries receive no compensation for Board service.
