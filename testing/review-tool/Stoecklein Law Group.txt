Re: Offering on a Best Efforts All or None Basis- Waiver of Rights as a Creditor

Dear Ms. Country:  

We understand that you are filing Form S-1 Registration and plan on raising money on an best efforts, all or none basis. The money raised from this offering will be put into an account that will not bar attachment from creditors. We know we may be one of those creditors and we agree to waive any rights and claims we have to funds in that account, other than any amount you pay us voluntarily pursuant to our agreement.

Sincerely    
/s/Donald Stoecklein
