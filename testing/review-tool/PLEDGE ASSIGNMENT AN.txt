^^all proceeds and products (both cash and non-cash) of the foregoing, whether now or hereafter arising under any of the foregoing.

^Rights of the Lender in the Collateral.

The Borrower agrees that with respect to the Collateral the Lender shall have all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as those provided by law and/or in this Agreement.

The Borrower acknowledges that the Lender has control over the Collateral within the meaning of Section 8-106 of the Uniform Commercial Code.

Any cash distribution payable in respect of the Collateral which represents, in whole or in part, a return of capital or is paid in violation of this Agreement, the Financing Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents shall be received by the Borrower in trust for the Lender, shall be paid immediately to the Lender and shall be retained by the Lender as part of the Collateral.

The Borrower covenants and agrees that no distribution or other benefit with respect to the Collateral shall be received by or for the benefit of the Borrower, and no vote shall be cast or member’s consent, waiver or ratification given or action taken by the Borrower in its capacity as a member of the LLC, which would violate or be inconsistent with any of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or the Financing Agreement or which would materially impair the position or interest of the Lender in the Collateral or dilute the percentage of the equity interests in the LLC pledged to the Lender.

^Obligations Hereunder Primary.

The obligations and liabilities of the Borrower under this Agreement shall be primary, direct and immediate, shall not be subject to any counterclaim, recoupment, set off, reduction or defense based upon any claim that the Borrower may have against the Lender or any other obligor and shall not be conditional or contingent upon pursuit or enforcement by the Lender of any remedies it may have against any other person with respect to the Obligations.

^REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce the Lender to make the Credit Facilities available to the Borrower under the Financing Agreement, the Borrower represents and warrants to the Lender, as follows:

^Percentage Ownership.

The Operating Agreement provided to Lender has not been amended, modified, restated, substituted, extended or renewed.

^Operating Agreement.

The Borrower has furnished the Lender with a true and complete copy of the executed Operating Agreement. The Borrower hereby agrees that the execution of this Agreement shall constitute the approval of the majority of the members required under Section 9.1 of the Operating Agreement.

^Title to Properties.

The Borrower has good and marketable title to the Collateral. The Borrower has legal, enforceable and uncontested rights to use freely such property and assets. The Borrower is the sole owner of all of the Collateral, free and clear of all security interests, pledges, voting trusts, agreements, liens, claims and encumbrances whatsoever, other than the security interest, assignment and lien granted under this Agreement. The ownership interests assigned as Collateral are subject to no outstanding options or other requirements with respect to such interests.

^Perfection and Priority of Collateral.

The Lender has, or upon execution and delivery of this Agreement and recording of the financing statements executed by the Borrower, will have, and will continue to have as security for the Obligations, a valid and perfected, first priority, lien on and security interest in all of the Collateral, free of all other liens, claims and rights of third parties whatsoever.

^LCC Interests.

None of the pledged ownership interests of the LLC are in certificated form.

^COVENANTS

Until payment in full and the performance of all of the Obligations and all of the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or secured hereby, the Borrower covenants and agrees with the Lender as follows:

^Delivery of Collateral.

Borrower will not allow any of the ownership interests of the LLC to become certificated without the Lender’s prior written consent. If Lender provides such consent and the ownership interests of the LLC are certificated, the Borrower shall deliver immediately to the Lender any certificates representing ownership interests in the LLC, and all instruments, items of payment and other Collateral received by the Borrower and executed irrevocable, undated and blank membership powers, substantially in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit C, for all of the assigned LLC interests. All Collateral at any time received or held by the Borrower shall be received and held by the Borrower in trust for the benefit of the Lender, and shall be kept separate and apart from, and not commingled with, the Borrower’s other assets.

^Defense of Title and Further Assurances.

The Borrower will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and to keep in full force and effect its interests in the Collateral, and shall defend, at its sole expense, the title to the Collateral and any part thereof. Further, the Borrower shall promptly, upon request by the Lender, execute, acknowledge and deliver any financing statement, endorsement, renewal, affidavit, deed, assignment, continuation statement, security agreement, certificate or other document as the Lender may reasonably require in order to perfect, preserve, maintain, protect, continue, realize upon, and/or extend the lien and security interest of the Lender under this Agreement and the priority thereof. Borrower shall pay to the Lender upon demand all taxes, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees) incurred by the Lender in connection with the preparation, execution, recording and filing of any such document or instrument mentioned aforesaid. Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Lender as its attorney-in-fact, with power of substitution from time to time, to take such actions as are described in this Section as well as any other action which Borrower is required to take under this Agreement or under any of the other Financing Documents.

^Operating Agreement.

^Protection of Collateral.

The Borrower agrees that the Lender may at any time take such steps as the Lender deems reasonably necessary to protect the Lender’s interest in, and to preserve the Collateral. The Borrower agrees to cooperate fully with the Lender’s efforts to preserve the Collateral and will take such actions to preserve the Collateral as the Lender may in good faith direct. All of the Lender’s expenses of preserving the Collateral, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees, shall be part of the Enforcement Costs.

^Certain Notices.

The Borrower will promptly notify the Lender in writing of any Event of Default and of any litigation, regulatory proceeding, or other event which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

^Books and Records; Information.

^^The Borrower shall maintain proper books and records in which full, true and correct entries are made of all dealings and transactions in relation to the Collateral and which reflect the lien of the Lender thereon.

^^The Borrower agrees that the Lender may from time to time and at its option (i) require the Borrower to, and the Borrower shall, periodically deliver to the Lender records and schedules, which show the status of the Collateral and such other matters which affect the Collateral, as well as copies of Borrower’s tax returns and filings; (ii) verify the Collateral and inspect the books and records of the Borrower and make copies thereof or extracts therefrom; (iii) notify any prospective buyers or transferees of the Collateral or any other Persons of the Lender’s interest in the Collateral; and (iv) disclose to prospective buyers or transferees from the Lender any and all information regarding the LLC, the Collateral and/or the Borrower.

The Borrower will not sell, discount, allow credits or allowances, assign, extend the time for payment on, convey, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof.

^Distributions.

The Borrower shall receive no dividend or distribution or other benefit with respect to the LLC, and shall not vote, consent, waive or ratify any action taken, which would violate or be inconsistent with any of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Financing Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents. The Borrower authorizes and directs the LLC to make all distributions and other payments constituting a part of the Collateral directly to the Lender upon written request of the Lender, without any additional authorization by the Borrower, after the occurrence of an Event of Default (as hereinafter defined). In the event any distribution or other payment constituting a part of the Collateral is received by the Borrower after the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Borrower shall immediately remit such distribution or payment to the Lender, together with any necessary endorsement or assignment. All amounts received by the Lender in accordance with this Section 3.9 shall, at the Lender’s option, be held as additional collateral for the Obligations or applied to the repayment of the Obligations, in such order and manner as the Lender may determine and without regard to the existence of an Event of Default.

^Liens.

The Borrower will not create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any lien upon any of the Collateral, other than liens in favor of the Lender.

The Lender may proceed to protect or enforce the Lender’s rights by an action or actions at law or in equity or by any other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any of the covenants herein contained or of any other agreement contained herein, or for an injunction against the violation of any of the terms hereof, or in aid of the exercise or execution of any right, remedy or power granted herein or by law.

4.2.3 Uniform Commercial Code.

The Lender shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under Title 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable Laws and in connection therewith may exercise all or any of the rights, powers and remedies of a secured party under Title 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Any notification of a sale or other disposition of all or any part of the Collateral required pursuant to Section 9-504 of Title 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code shall be deemed commercially reasonable if sent in accordance with Section 5.1 (Notices) at least ten (10) days prior to the sale or other disposition. Upon demand by the Lender, the Borrower shall assemble the Collateral and all books and records and make it available to the Lender, at a place designated by the Lender. The Lender or its agents may without notice from time to time enter upon the Borrower’s premises to take possession of the Collateral and all books and records, to remove it, or otherwise to prepare it for sale, or to sell or otherwise dispose of it.

4.2.4 Sale or Other Disposition of Collateral.

The Lender may sell or redeem the Collateral, or any part thereof, in one or more sales, at public or private sale, conduct by any officer or agent of, or auctioneer or attorney for, the Lender, at the Lender’s place of business or elsewhere, for cash, upon credit or future delivery, and at such price or prices as the Lender shall, in its sole discretion, determine, and the Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral so sold.

Further:

^^Each purchaser of all or any portion of the Collateral (including the Lender) at any such sale shall hold the Collateral so sold, absolutely free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including, without limitation, any equity or right of redemption, of the Borrower, which the Borrower hereby specifically waives, to the extent it may lawfully do so, all rights of redemption, stay or appraisal which the Borrower has or may have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted.

^^Any written notice required by law of any sale, public or private, of all or any part of the Collateral shall be deemed in all circumstances to have been given in a commercially reasonable manner if sent at least ten (10) days prior to such sale by mail to the Borrower at the address for the Borrower set forth in Section 5.1 (Notices). At any such sale the Collateral may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels. The Lender shall not be obligated to make any sale pursuant to any such notice. In case of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral for credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Lender until the selling price is paid by the purchaser thereof, but the Lender shall not incur any liability in case of the failure of such purchaser to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold, and in case of any such failure, such Collateral may again be sold under and pursuant to the provisions hereof. The Lender, as attorney-in-fact, pursuant to Section 3.2 (Defense of Title), may, in the name and stead of the Borrower, make and execute all conveyances, assignments and transfers of the Collateral sold pursuant to this Section. The Borrower shall, if so requested by the Lender, ratify and confirm any sale or sales by executing and delivering to the Lender, or to such purchaser or purchasers, all such documents as may, in the judgment of the Lender, be advisable for the purpose.

^^If any consent, approval, or authorization of any Governmental Authority or any Person having any interest therein, should be necessary to effectuate any sale or other disposition of the Collateral, the Borrower agrees to execute all such applications and other instruments, and to take all other action, as may be required in connection with securing any such consent, approval or authorization.

^^The Borrower recognizes that the Lender may be unable to effect a public sale of all or a part of the Collateral consisting of “securities” by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and other applicable federal and state Laws. The Lender may, therefore, in its discretion, take such steps as it may deem appropriate to comply with such Laws and may, for example, at any sale of the Collateral consisting of securities restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers as to their number, nature of business and investment intention, including, without limitation, a requirement that the Persons making such purchases represent and agree to the satisfaction of the Lender that they are purchasing such securities for their account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale of any thereof. The Borrower covenants and agrees to do or cause to be done promptly all such acts and things as the Lender may request from time to time and as may be necessary to offer and/or sell the securities or any part thereof in a manner which is valid and binding and in conformance with all applicable Laws.

4.2.5 Specific Rights With Regard to Collateral.

In addition to all other rights and remedies provided hereunder or as shall exist at law or in equity from time to time, upon the continuance of an Event of Default, the Lender may (but shall be under no obligation to), without notice to the Borrower, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Lender as its attorney-in-fact, with power of substitution, in the name of the Lender or in the name of the Borrower or otherwise, for the use and benefit of the Lender, but at the cost and expense of the Borrower and without notice to the Borrower:

^^take any other action necessary or beneficial to realize upon or dispose of the Collateral; and

^^upon written instructions to the LLC, the Lender or its designees shall be entitled to become a member in the LLC in the place and stead of the Borrower and shall be entitled to exercise and enjoy all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, including without limitation, the right to (i) participate in the management and administration of the LLC’s business and affairs, (ii) require information regarding or an accounting of LLC transactions and (iii) inspect the LLC’s books.

If the sale or other disposition of the Collateral fails to fully satisfy the Obligations and the other obligations secured by this Agreement, the Borrower shall remain liable to the Lender for any deficiency, if and to the extent the Borrower is liable for the payment or performance of the Obligations under the provisions of any of the Financing Documents.

4.2.7 Performance by Lender.

If the Borrower shall fail to perform, observe or comply with any of the conditions, covenants, terms, stipulations or agreements contained in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents, the Lender without notice to or demand upon the Borrower and without waiving or releasing any of the Obligations or any Event of Default, may (but shall be under no obligation to) at any time thereafter make such payment or perform such act for the account and at the expense of the Borrower, and may enter upon the premises of the Borrower for that purpose and take all such action thereon as the Lender may consider necessary or appropriate for such purpose and the Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Lender as its attorney-in-fact to do so, with power of substitution, in the name of the Lender or in the name of the Borrower or otherwise, for the use and benefit of the Lender, but at the cost and expense of the Borrower and without notice to the Borrower. All sums so paid or advanced by the Lender together with interest thereon from the date of payment, advance or incurring until paid in full at the highest rate of interest charged under the Note and all costs and expenses, shall be deemed part of the Enforcement Costs, shall be paid by the Borrower to the Lender on demand, and shall constitute and become a part of the Obligations.

4.2.8 Other Remedies.

The Lender may from time to time proceed to protect or enforce its rights by an action or actions at law or in equity or by any other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents, or for an injunction against the violation of any of the terms of this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents, or in aid of the exercise or execution of any right, remedy or power granted in this Agreement, the Financing Documents, and/or applicable Laws.

Such costs and expenses shall become part of the Obligations.

^Receipt Sufficient Discharge to Purchaser.

Upon any sale or other disposition of the Collateral or any part thereof, the receipt of purchase money by the Lender or other Person making the sale or disposition shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser for the purchase money, and such purchaser shall not be obligated to see to the application thereof.

^Remedies, Etc. Cumulative.

Each right, power and remedy of the Lender as provided for in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents or in any related instrument or agreement or now or thereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other right, power or remedy provided for in this Agreement or in the other Financing Documents or in any related document, instrument or agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Lender of any one or more of such rights, powers or remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Lender of any or all such other rights, powers or remedies.

No failure or delay by the Lender to insist upon the strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement of this Agreement or of any of the other Financing Documents or of any related documents, instruments or agreements, or to exercise any right, power or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof, shall constitute a waiver of any such term, condition, covenant or agreement or of any such breach, or preclude the Lender from exercising any such right, power or remedy at any later time or times. By accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable under this Agreement or under any of the other Financing Documents or under any related document, instrument or agreement, the Lender shall not be deemed to waive the right either to require prompt payment when due of all other amounts payable under this

This Agreement may be executed in any number of duplicate originals, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same institute.

^Waiver of Trial by Jury.

BORROWER AND THE LENDER HEREBY JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO WHICH BORROWER AND THE LENDER MAY BE PARTIES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY PERTAINING TO (A) THIS AGREEMENT, (B) ANY OF THE FINANCING DOCUMENTS, OR (C) THE COLLATERAL. THIS WAIVER CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY OF ALL CLAIMS AGAINST ALL PARTIES TO SUCH ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT.

This waiver is knowingly, willingly and voluntarily made by Borrower and the Lender, and Borrower and the Lender hereby represent that no representations of fact or opinion have been made by any individual to induce this waiver of trial by jury or to in any way modify or nullify its effect. Borrower and the Lender further represent that they have been represented in the signing of this Agreement and in the making of this waiver by independent legal counsel, selected of their own free will, and that they have had the opportunity to discuss this waiver with counsel.

^Liability of the Lender.

The Borrower hereby agrees that the Lender shall not be chargeable for any negligence, mistake, act or omission of any accountant, examiner, agency or attorney employed by the Lender in making examinations, investigations or collections, or otherwise in perfecting, maintaining, protecting or realizing upon any lien or security interest or any other interest in the Collateral or other security for the Obligations. Except for willful misconduct or gross negligence, the Lender shall be under no liability for, and the Borrower hereby releases the Lender from, all claims for loss or damage caused by (a) the Lender’s failure to perform or collect any of the Collateral, or (b) the Lender’s failure to preserve or protect any rights of the Borrower under the Collateral. The Borrower agrees that the duties of the Lender with respect to the Collateral shall be solely to use reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in Lender’s possession, which shall not include any steps necessary to preserve rights against prior parties. In the event the Lender enforces or seeks to enforce any of the rights of an owner of the LLC under any of the Collateral, the Borrower shall immediately reimburse the Lender for such costs and expenses (including actual attorney’s fees reasonably incurred) so incurred and payment of such sums shall be secured by this Agreement.
