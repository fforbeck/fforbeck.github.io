\centered **EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN**

\centered **Restated Effective as of [[Date 1: Date]]**

The Executive Deferred Compensation Plan of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (the “Plan”) was initially established effective [[Date 2: Date]] to provide a vehicle for the deferral of taxable income. The Plan is intended to be an “unfunded” plan maintained for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management employees for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety, effective [[Date 3: Date]], primarily for the purpose of complying with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), and Proposed Regulations §§1.409A-1 et seq., and the Company operated the Plan in good faith compliance with Code Section 409A and the restated Plan document since that time. The Plan was also amended and restated in its entirety, effective [[Date 4: Date]], for the purpose of continuing compliance with Section 409A of the Code and Final Regulations §§1.409A-1 et seq. The Plan is now restated in its entirety, effective [[Date 1]], for the purpose of replacing a reference to the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan with the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, which superseded the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan on [[Date 1]].

An Executive shall be eligible to become a participant in the Plan as of his or her first day of employment with the Company or, if later, the date on which he or she commences employment in an eligible position. An Executive shall cease to be eligible to defer Compensation under the Plan if he or she shall cease to occupy an eligible position.

Each Executive shall remain a Participant under the Plan until all amounts credited to the Participant's Account have been distributed to the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary.

\centered **DEFERRALS; VESTING**

^DEFERRAL ELECTIONS  
^^A Participant may elect to defer receipt of Salary and/or Other Compensation, as and to the extent such deferral opportunities are made available under the Plan by the Plan Administrator, for a Plan Year by completing and returning to the Plan Administrator (or his or her designee) a written election on the form prescribed by the Plan Administrator. Except as provided below, a Participant’s election shall be made between [[Date 7: Date]] and [[Date 6]] of the year immediately preceding the year in which such Salary and/or Other Compensation will be earned, and shall become irrevocable with respect to a Plan Year as of [[Date 6]] of such preceding year.

^^An Executive who shall first become eligible to participate in the Plan or any similar non-qualified deferred compensation plan of the Company after the time specified for making the deferral election under the Plan for the Plan Year as provided in 3.1(a) above, may, within 30 days after his or her initial eligibility date, elect to defer receipt of Salary and/or Other Compensation earned during the remainder of such Plan Year. An Executive’s election under this paragraph shall apply only to Salary and/or Other Compensation earned with respect to services provided after his or her initial eligibility date. An Executive shall not be permitted to make an election under this paragraph if he or she was eligible to participate in the Plan or any similar non-qualified deferred compensation plan of the Company within the 24 month period prior to the beginning of the 30 day election period.

^^A Participant shall elect the form and timing of his or her benefit distribution at the time at which such Participant makes a deferral election under this Section with respect to any Plan Year.

^^A Participant’s deferral election shall remain in effect until the date on which such Participant ceases to be an Executive or until he or she modifies such election on a prospective basis with respect to a subsequent Plan Year (in accordance with the requirements of subsection (a) above and any applicable procedures prescribed by the Plan Administrator). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the deferral election of a Participant who shall receive a distribution from the Plan on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be canceled for the remainder of the Plan Year, as soon as administratively practicable following the approval of such distribution, and may not resume unless and until the Participant shall make a new deferral election for a future Plan Year.

^VESTING. A Participant’s interest in the amounts deferred under the Plan, and any notional earnings thereon, shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable at all times.

\centered **INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS AND DISTRIBUTIONS**

^INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. The Plan Administrator shall designate the Investment Accounts that will be available to Participants under the Plan from time to time. The Plan Administrator shall also designate how often and what procedures must be followed to reallocate amounts in the Investment Accounts. The Company shall credit a Participant’s deferrals to the Investment Accounts selected by the Participant. All amounts credited to the IDEXX Stock Investment Account shall be converted into Deferred Stock Units, each representing a notional interest in one share of IDEXX Stock. The number of Deferred Stock Units credited to a Participant’s account with respect to a deferral shall be determined by dividing the amount of the deferral by the closing price of one share of IDEXX Stock on the conversion date established by the Plan Administrator with respect to any deferral period, which conversion date shall not be later than 30 days after the end of the deferral period.

^DISTRIBUTIONS.  

^^In general, distributions of amounts credited to the Participant’s Investment Accounts shall be paid in cash. However, Deferred Stock Units held in a Participant’s IDEXX Stock Investment Account shall be distributed in the form of shares of IDEXX Stock equal to the number of Deferred Stock Units held in the Participant’s Account as of the close of business on the last trading day prior to the event with respect to which the distribution is made.

^^Benefits under the Plan shall be distributed to a Participant in a single lump sum or pursuant to a fixed schedule of payments at the time(s), or upon the event or events, specified on the Participant’s distribution election form on file with the Plan Administrator. For purposes of applying the provisions of this paragraph, if an installment form of distribution shall be made available by the Plan Administrator, such form of distribution shall be treated as an entitlement to receive a single payment, as described in Treasury Regulations § 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, benefits under the Plan may not be distributed earlier than the first of the following events to occur:

^^^the Participant’s Separation from Service;

^^^the date the Participant becomes Disabled;

^^^the Participant’s date of death;

^^^the time(s) specified by the Participant in his or her deferral election, subject to such requirements as the Plan Administrator may impose consistent with Code Section 409A;

^^^a Change in Control of the Company; or

^^^the occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emergency.

If a payment under the Plan is to be made on account of an event specified by the Participant, such payment shall be made within 30 days following the occurrence of such event.

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing:  
^^^all benefits under the Plan shall be distributed to all Participants upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company;

^^^a distribution payable on account of a Separation from Service to a Participant who is a Specified Employee shall not be made sooner than 6 months after the date of his or her Separation from Service for any reason or, if earlier, his or her death;

^^^an Officer shall not receive a distribution of shares of IDEXX Stock on account of his or her Separation from Service sooner than 12 months after the date of such Separation from Service or, if earlier, upon his or her death;

^^A Participant’s election as to the distribution of compensation previously deferred may be modified only subject to the following requirements:

^^^no change in a distribution election may take effect until 12 months after the date on which the change in election is made;

^^^a Participant may not modify an election to receive a fixed schedule of payments within 12 months of the first scheduled payment date, **and**

^^^a change in a Participant’s distribution election must defer the date of the distribution by at least 5 years from the date the distribution would otherwise have been made.

^^Upon application by the Participant, if the Plan Administrator determines that a Participant has experienced an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Plan Administrator may authorize the distribution of all or a portion of the Participant’s benefit under the Plan. The amount distributed with respect to the Unforeseeable Emergency must not exceed the amounts reasonably necessary to satisfy such emergency, plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant’s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship).

\centered **ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES**
