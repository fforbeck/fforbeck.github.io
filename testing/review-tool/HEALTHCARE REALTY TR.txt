\centered **2010 Restricted Stock Implementation for Non-Employee Directors** 

^*Purpose of the Restricted Stock Implementation.* This 2010 Restricted Stock Implementation for Non-Employee Directors (the “Implementation”) of Healthcare Realty Trust Incorporated (the “Company”) is being adopted pursuant to the Company’s 2007 Employees Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Plan”).

Under the Plan, non-employee directors are “Eligible Persons” who may be designated by the Compensation Committee to receive Awards.
