^^^Subsequent Settlement 

^^On the Second Settlement Date, if the Settlement Number is positive, GS&Co. shall deliver to the Company a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Number. 

^^In the event that the Settlement Number is negative, the Settlement Period and the Final Cash Settlement Amount shall be determined as follows: Commencing on the second Trading Day immediately following the Pricing Period Termination Date, GS&Co. will purchase a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the absolute value of the Settlement Number and, at the conclusion of such purchases, GS&Co. shall notify the Company of the completion of the Settlement Period and the Final Cash Settlement Amount. GS&Co. shall use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to effect such purchases of Common Stock in a manner that would comply with the limitations set forth in clauses (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4) and (c) of Rule 10b-18 as if such rule were applicable to such purchases.

^^^The Company’s election to deliver such shares pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall not be valid and cash settlement shall apply if the representation made by the Company to GS&Co. in Section XVII(e) is not true and correct as of the date the Company makes such election, as if made on such date;

^^^If such shares do not satisfy the conditions for Registered Settlement, then such shares shall be sold in the Private Placement Settlement and GS&Co. may apply a commercially reasonable discount to the value of such shares and request by written notice an additional number of shares of Common Stock having a value equal to such discount. The Company shall deliver such additional number of shares within three Trading Days following delivery of GS&Co.’s notice communicating such number of shares. 

^^Any share delivery pursuant to paragraph (d) above shall be effected pursuant to Registered Settlement or Private Placement Settlement, at the election of the Company.

^^(i) If GS&Co. is the Defaulting Party or Affected Party, upon receipt of a Loss Notice from the Company where the amount of such Loss is a positive number, or (ii) if the Company is the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party where the amount of such Loss is a negative number, then in either case GS&Co. shall promptly pay to the Company the absolute value of such Loss in cash or deliver, pursuant to paragraph (c) below, Alternative Termination Delivery Units at the Company’s election, which binding election shall be made in writing no later than one business day immediately following the Non-Defaulting Party’s or the Non-Affected Party delivery of the related Loss Notice, as applicable (the date of such delivery, the “Default Notice Day”); *provided* that the Company’s election to receive the Alternative Termination Delivery Units pursuant to this Section X(b) shall not be valid and cash settlement shall apply if the representation made by the Company to GS&Co. in Section XVII(e) is not true and correct as of the date the Company makes such election, as if made on such date. 

^^If GS&Co. is the Defaulting Party or Affected Party and the amount of the Loss is a positive number or if the Company is the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party where the amount of the Loss is a negative number, and in each case if the Company elects physical settlement pursuant to paragraph (b) above, (i) GS&Co. shall, beginning on the first Trading Day following the Default Notice Day and ending on the Trading Day when GS&Co. shall have satisfied its obligations under this clause (the “Termination Share Purchase Period”), purchase a number of Alternative Termination Delivery Units (the “Net ATDU Number”) equal to (x) (A) the Loss *divided by* (B) the Termination Price (such quotient, the “Total ATDU Number”) *minus* (y) any Alternative Termination Delivery Units then directly or indirectly held by GS&Co. in its hedge position related to this Transaction; and (ii) GS&Co. shall deliver the Total ATDU Number to the Company as soon as practicable. The timing of the purchases of the Net ATDU Number by GS&Co., the price paid per unit pursuant to such purchases and the manner in which such purchases are made, including without limitation whether such transactions are made on any securities exchange or privately, shall be within the reasonable judgment of GS&Co.; *provided* that GS&Co. shall use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to effect such purchases of Common Stock in a manner that would comply with the limitations set forth in clauses (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4) and (c) of Rule 10b-18 as if such rule were applicable to such purchases. 

^^(i) If GS&Co. is the Defaulting Party or Affected Party, upon receipt of a Loss Notice from the Company where the amount of such Loss is a negative number, or (ii) if the Company is the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party where the amount of such Loss is a positive number, then in either case the Company shall promptly pay to GS&Co. the absolute value of such Loss in cash or deliver, pursuant to paragraph (e) below, Alternative Termination Delivery Units at the Company’s election, which binding election shall be made in writing no later than one business day immediately following the Non-Defaulting Party’s or the Non-Affected Party delivery of the related Loss Notice, as applicable (the date of such delivery, the “Default Notice Day”); *provided* that the Company’s election to deliver the Alternative Termination Delivery Units pursuant to this Section X(d) shall not be valid and cash settlement shall apply if the representation made by the Company to GS&Co. in Section XVII(e) is not true and correct as of the date the Company makes such election, as if made on such date. 

^^If GS&Co. is the Defaulting Party or Affected Party and the amount of the Loss is a negative number or if the Company is the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party where the amount of the Loss is a positive number, and in each case if the Company elects physical settlement pursuant to paragraph (d) above, the Company shall deliver to GS&Co. a number of Alternative Termination Delivery Units (“Company ATDU Number”) having a value equal to the absolute value of the amount of such Loss. Such value shall be determined in a commercially reasonable manner by GS&Co. based on the then fair market value of the Alternative Termination Delivery Units, may take into account any transfer restrictions imposed by law on any securities constituting Alternative Termination Delivery Units and shall be conducted in compliance with the procedures for Registered Settlement or Private Placement Settlement, at the election of the Company. 

^^In addition to the payments set forth in subsections (b) and (d) above, the Defaulting Party or Affected Party agrees to indemnify the other party from and against any reasonable expenses (including reasonable legal fees and other expenses of collection) it may incur as a result of any default by such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party shall not be responsible for any special, indirect or consequential damages, even if informed of the possibility thereof. 

^^^Other Agreements 

^^The parties acknowledge and agree that this Letter Agreement is not intended to convey to GS&Co. rights against the Company hereunder that are senior to the claims of common stockholders in any U.S. bankruptcy proceedings of the Company; *provided*, *however*, that nothing herein shall limit or shall be deemed to limit GS&Co.’s right to pursue remedies in the event of a breach by the Company of its obligations and agreements with respect to this Letter Agreement; and *provided*, *further,* that in pursuing a claim against the Company in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution with respect to Company, GS&Co.’s rights hereunder shall rank on a parity with the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock enforcing similar rights under a contract involving shares of Common Stock. 

^^The Company agrees that the material terms of this Transaction (and any other similar transactions), and the consequences of such transactions on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company, will be disclosed by the Company in accordance with all rules, regulations, accounting principles (including ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging  Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (or any successor issue statements)) and laws applicable to the Company in its periodic filings under the Exchange Act and its financial statements and notes thereto.
