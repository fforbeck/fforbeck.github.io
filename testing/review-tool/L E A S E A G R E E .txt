^^Construction Allowance  
In consideration for the performance by Tenant of certain work in the Premises, Landlord shall pay to Tenant the Construction Allowance. The Construction Allowance is for the purpose of constructing or improving qualified long-term real property for use in Tenant's trade or business at the Premises in accordance with Section 110(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Landlord shall be the legal title and beneficial owner of all qualified long-term real property (as defined in Section 110(a) of the Internal Revenue Code) that are acquired with or funded by the Construction Allowance. Each party shall prepare its federal, state and local income tax forms and schedules, and calculate taxable income, in a manner consistent with Landlord's ownership of such improvements for all taxable years. The parties understand that qualified long-term real property (as defined in Section 110(a) of the Internal Revenue Code) includes the following costs and/or fees: architect, building permit, dumpsters and clean-up, barricades and staging area, demolition, concrete work, masonry work, structural and miscellaneous steel, roof work, carpentry, doors and roll-up grilles, drywall and metal studs, lay-in ceiling work, floor covering (carpet, VCT, vinyl base), ceramic tile, granite and marble, non-fixture package millwork and trim, painting and wall covering, storefront and glazing, plumbing, fire protection sprinkler, HVAC work (including curbs and units), electrical and lighting, fire alarm, connections to energy management system, meters and connection fees, utility usage fees, impact fees, and other property that qualifies as nonresidential real property under Section 168(e)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code that is part of or otherwise present at the Premises. If Tenant's final accounting of the costs related to Tenant's construct ion reveals that the Construction Allowance exceeds the cost of the qualified long-term real property (as defined in Section 110(a) of the Internal Revenue Code), Tenant shall notify Landlord of the amount of such excess, which notice shall serve as the parties' agreement for purposes of Section 110(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, but in no event shall the Construction Allowance be reduced.

^^Payment of Construction Allowance  
Fifty percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the Construction Allowance shall be due on or prior to the Anticipated Delivery Date. Forty percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the Construction Allowance shall be due ten (10) days after the date on which Tenant opens for business in the entire Premises. The balance of the Construction Allowance shall be due ten (10) days after Tenant delivers a copy of a lien waiver and release from Tenant's General Contractor. Tenant shall have no obligation to commence construction at the Premises until receipt by Tenant of the first installment of the Construction Allowance. In the event Landlord fails to deliver the first installment of the Construction Allowance to Tenant by the required due date, Tenant may elect to begin construction; however, such election shall not be deemed a waiver of any of the Delivery of Possession requirements, and the Construction Period shall be extended by one day for each day that Landlord fails to so deliver the first installment of the Construction Allowance.

Except with respect to Tenant's General Contractor from whom a waiver of lien shall be required, the submission by Tenant of lien waivers from any other contractors, subcontractors or materialmen performing any work on behalf of Tenant at the Premises shall not be a condition precedent to the payment of any portion of the Construction Allowance. Nevertheless, Tenant shall submit such waivers as it has in its possession as soon as practicable after receipt of the same and, with respect to any subcontract for which no waiver is submitted, Tenant shall protect Landlord's interest from any lien in the manner provided in Section 17.3. If Landlord fails to pay any portion of the Construction Allowance within the time periods provided for hereinabove, and if such failure continues for a period of seven (7) days after writt en demand for payment by Tenant to Landlord, then in addition to all other rights and remedies that Tenant may have against Landlord (but without duplication in recovering the amounts due Tenant), Tenant shall be entitled to deduct the unpaid and overdue portion of the Construction Allowance from the Rent otherwise becoming due hereunder, together with interest on the unpaid balance thereof at the Default Rate.

^^Exterior Protections  
Subject to the REOAs, Landlord shall not take or consent to any action which materially affects access to, visibility of, parking for or use of the Premises or which results in a material modification to the Site Plan without the prior written consent of Tenant.

In addition, Landlord shall not cause or permit to be placed, installed or erected any permanent or temporary structure (including, but not limited to carts, kiosks, planters, trees, vending machines, RMU’s, benches, s, ATMs, or holiday displays) within the Protected Area as hereinafter defined. The "**Protected Area**" means that portion of the Landlord’s Parcel so labeled on **Exhibit A**. In performing any construction work, repairs or maintenance in the Landlord’s Parcel permi tted under this Lease after Tenant has taken physical possession of the Premises, Landlord shall use good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any interference with parking for, access to or visibility or use of the Premises or the business of Tenant or any subtenant or licensee of Tenant. Nothing contained in this Section shall restrict Landlord from complying with Legal Requirements, provided that, if the manner in which such Legal Requirement may be implemented is discretionary, then Tenant shall have the right to consent to such implementation. If Landlord violates its covenant with respect to the Protected Area, then, in addition to Tenant's right to seek other remedies, Tenant shall immediately have the right to (1) deduct from Rent Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00) per day for each day of such violation , and (2) if such violation continues for more than thirty (30) days, Tenant may terminate this Lease on not less than ninety (90) days' written notice to Landlor d; and (3) full and adequate relief by temporary or permanent injunction and by specific performance.

\centered Ex. H, pg. 12

Subject to the REOAs, Landlord shall not take or consent to any action which materially affects access to, visibility of, parking for or use of the Premises or which results in a material modification to the Site Plan without the prior written consent of Tenant which consent may be withheld in Tenant’s sole discretion.

^^REOAs  
^Tenant acknowledges that the Shopping Center is subject to the REOAs. Landlord covenants, represents and warrants to Tenant that to its knowledge: (1) the REOAs have not been modified, amended or terminated, except as described in Section 1.1 herein; (2) the REOAs are currently in full force and effect; and (3) as of the date hereof, no default under the REOAs exist beyond any applicable notice and cure period. This Lease is subject and subordinate to the REOAs.

Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, in the event of any conflict or ambiguity existing between the REOAs and this Lease, this Lease shall control as between Landlord and Tenant.

^Landlord shall, during the Term: (1) perform and observe all of the terms, covenants, provisions and conditions of the REOAs to the extent of Landlord’s obligations under this Lease and (2) diligently enforce, at its sole expense, the covenants, agreements and obligations of the REOAs. Landlord shall not amend, or modify the REOAs if such amendment or modification could diminish the rights or increase the obligations of Tenant thereunder or under this Lease, or could adversely affect Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises or the conduct of Tenant's business therein, nor shall Landlord terminate the REOAs. Whenever, pursuant to the REOAs, the consent or approval of Landlord shall be required by or requested, and such consent or approval could diminish the rights or increase the obligations of Tenant thereunder or under this Lease, or could adversely affect Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises, or the conduct of Tenant's business therein, such consent or approval shall not be granted without the prior written consent of Tenant, which consent may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion.

^Landlord shall obtain any third-party approvals required under the REOAs for the performance of Landlord's Work (including, without limitation, Tenant's plans and signage, as applicable), Tenant's Work and the operation of Tenant's business in the Premises. Tenant shall have the right to assume, and rely on such assumption, that Landlord has obtained all consents and approvals required under the REOAs prior to giving Landlord's consent or approval to anything required under this Lease, and Tenant shall have no obligation to request any consent or approval directly from any third party under the REOAs, although Tenant shall, upon Landlord's request, cooperate with Landlord in obtaining any such consent or approval.

^^Master Lease  
Intentionally omitted.  
^^Interview Office  
Subject to the REOAs and all Legal Requirements, during the Construction Period, Landlord shall permit Tenant to use such available enclosed office, conference room or trailer as Landlord and Tenant may agree for Tenant's use in conducting employee interviews and recruiting.

^^Initial Term

^"**Lease Year**" means a period of twelve (12) consecutive calendar months. The first Lease Year shall commence on the Rent Commencement Date and expire on the last day of the month, twelve (12) full calendar months next following the Rent Commencement Date, except that, if the Rent Commencement Date occurs on the first day of the calendar month, then the first Lease Year shall end on the day immediately preceding the first anniversary of the Rent Commencement Date. Subsequent Lease Years shall be each consecutive twelve (12) calendar month period thereafter. If the last Lease Year would expire on a date other than [[Date 7: Date]], then the last Lease Year shall be extended to the next su cceeding [[Date 7]].

^^Delivery of Possession  
Landlord anticipates that Delivery of Possession shall occur at 8 a.m. on the Anticipated Delivery Date. Notwithstanding that the Delivery of Possession requirements may have been met, the Commencement Date and Delivery of Possession shall not be deemed to occur and the Construction Period shall not commence to run prior to the Anticipated Delivery Date, unless Tenant in its sole discretion elects to accept such early possession in writing.

^^Delay in Delivery of Possession  
^If Landlord has not satisfied the Delivery of Possession requirements by the Anticipated Delivery Date, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing periodically (and otherwise promptly upon Tenant's request) of the status of Delivery of Possession requirements and the date by which Landlord anticipates in good faith that it will satisfy the Delivery of Possession requirements, until the Delivery of Possession requirements have been satisfied.

^If Delivery of Possession does not occur on or before the Anticipated Delivery Date, other than due to a Tenant Delay, then in addition to all other rights and remedies that Tenant may have against Landlord (but without duplication in recovering the amounts due Tenant), Landlord shall pay to Tenant an amount equal to Nine Hundred Seventy-One and 98/100 Dollars ($971.98) for each day of delay (the "**Late Delivery Fee**"). Tenant shall receive the Late Delivery Fee for each day of delay from the Anticipated Delivery Date until delivery of the Premises is made to Tenant consistent with the terms of this Lease, including substantial completion of Landlord's Work, and all other Delivery of Possessi on requirements are satisfied. If Landlord fails to pay any portion of the Late Delivery Fee within ten (10) days after demand therefor, then in addition to all other rights and remedies that Tenant may have against Landlord, Tenant shall be entitled to deduct the unpaid and overdue portion of the Late Delivery Fee from Rent otherwise becoming due hereunder, together with interest on the unpaid balance thereof at the Default Rate from the date originally due. "**Tenant Delay**" means an act or omission of Tenant in violation of this Lease which causes Landlord to fail to timely complete Landlord's Work. The parties agree that Tenant's actual damages as a result of Landlord's late delivery would be extremely difficult or impracticable to determine, and acknowledge that the Late Delivery Fee has been agreed upon, after negotiation, as the parties' best and reasonable estimate of Tenant's damages.

^If Delivery of Possession does not occur within three months (3) months after the Anticipated Delivery Date, other than due to a Tenant Delay, then in addition to all other rights and remedies that Tenant may have against Landlord, Tenant shall have the right anytime thereafter while such condition exists to terminate this Lease on ten (10) days' written notice thereof to Landlord if the Delivery of Possession requirements have not occurred within such ten (10) day period. Upon such termination, this Lease shall be of no further force or effect (except that Tenant shall have the right to receive payment of the Late Delivery Fee for each day through the date of termination).

\centered Ex. H, pg. 14

^^Option to Extend Term  
Tenant shall have two (2) consecutive separate options to extend the Term for successive renewal terms of five (5) Lease Years each.

^^Percentage Rent  
Tenant shall pay to Landlord, at Landlord's notice address, Percentage Rent. Percentage Rent shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord within ninety (90) days after the end of each Lease Year.

^customer credit insurance;  
^gift certificates, or like vouchers, until such time as the same have been converted into a sale by redemption at the Premises; and

^^Landlord's Audit  
For purposes of permitting verification by Landlord of the Gross Sales reported by Tenant, Landlord shall have the right, upon fourteen (14) days written notice, no more than once in every twelve (12) month period, to inspect and audit all such books and records relating to Tenant’s Gross Sales. Landlord’s audit shall occur during normal business hours in Tenant's corporate office. If such an audit reveals that Tenant has understated its Gross Sales by more than three percent ([[Percentage 6: Number]]%) for any Lease Year resulting in an underpayment of Percentage Rent, Tenant, in addition to paying the additional Percentage Rent due, shall pay the reasonable cost of the audit within thirty (30) days of Tenant's receipt of Landlord's demand for the same and copies of all bills or invoices on which such cost is based. & #160;The parties hereto understand and agree that Tenant has made no representations nor promises of any kind with respect to whether or not Percentage Rent will be paid during any year of the term hereof, nor has Tenant warranted any amount or expected amount with respect to, or the occurrence of, any Gross Sales in the Premises. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to create, constitute or imply any obligation or duty upon Tenant to operate or conduct business operations of any type whatsoever upon the Premises. Landlord agrees that all statements of Gross Sales furnished to it under this Lease, if any, and any information obtained by Landlord as the result of an audit of Tenant’s Gross Sales as permitted hereunder, shall be held in strict confidence by Landlord and shall not be divulged by Landlord to any person or used for any purpose, except that Landlord shall be permitted to divulge such information (1) when necessary in connection with any bona fide prospective sale of the Premises, (2) when necessary in connection with the trial of any action, proceeding or arbitration between Landlord and Tenant, (3) to any mortgagee or prospective mortgagee of the Premises, and (4) pursuant to a subpoena duly and validly served upon Landlord.

^^Tenant's Audit  
Landlord shall keep safe and intact at Landlord's principal offices in the United States all of the records, books, accounts and other data relating to Other Charges.

Tenant shall give Landlord not less than ten (10) days' written notice of its intention to conduct any such audit. If, as a result of such audit, it is determined that the amount paid by Tenant for the Lease Years under consideration has been overpaid, Landlord shall promptly rebate to Tenant the overpayment or, at Tenant's e lection, Tenant may offset the amount of the overpayment against Rent becoming due. If, as a result of such audit, it is determined that the amount paid by Tenant for such type of Other Charges for any Lease Year under consideration has been overpaid by more than three percent ([[Percentage 6]]%), then, in addition to rebating to Tenant the overpayment, Landlord shall also pay the reasonable costs incurred by Tenant for such audit within thirty (30) days of Landlord's receipt of Tenant's demand for the same and copies of all bills or invoices on which such cost is based.

^^Taxes Payable Over Extended Periods

If any Real Estate Taxes are permitted to be paid in installments, then there shall be included in Real Estate Taxes for any Tax Year only the amount of the installment of such assessment that would result had Landlord elected to pay such assessment over the maximum number of installments permitted by law (regardless of what period of time Landlord actually pays the same over) and Tenant shall be responsible for only those installments which are attributable to the Term. Landlord will not submit improvements to a special improvements district without Tenant's prior written consent, unless such submission shall not result in any charges to Tenant for such improvements, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

^^Payment of Taxes  
The responsibility for the payment of Real Estate Taxes shall be upon Landlord. On the first day of each calendar month during the Term commencing on the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay along with and at the same time as each monthly installment of Minimum Rent, one-twelfth (1/12th) of Tenant's Tax Share of Real Estate Taxes for such Tax Year, as reasonably estimated by Landlord and disclosed to Tenant at the beginning of such Tax Year. Such amounts shall be held by Landlord for payment of the Real Estate Taxes. Within ninety (90) days after the end of each calendar year or partial year, Landlord shall furnish Tenant with an itemized statement of actual Real Estate Taxes showing how Real Estate Taxes and Tenant's Tax Share of Real Estate Taxes were calculated by Landlord, accompanied by the tax bill or bills on which such statement is rendered. Tenant's Tax Share of Real Estate Taxes shall be calculated net of any early payment discounts available from the taxing authority and any rebates or refunds occurring during such Tax Year. If Landlord has not timely furnished such statement, then Tenant’s obligation to pay the monthly portion of Tenant's Tax Share of Real Estate Taxes shall be abated until Landlord furnishes such statement and the actual annual Tenant's Tax Share of Real Estate Taxes shall be reduced by the time period of any such abatement. If Tenant's aggregate payments exceed the actual Tenant's Tax Share of Real Estate Taxes, Landlord shall promptly pay to Tenant the amount of the overpayment at the time of delivery of the annual statement. If Tenant's aggregate payments are less than the actual Tenant's Tax Share of Real Estate Taxes, Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Landlord within thirty (30) days after Tenant's receipt of such annual statement, provided that Tenant may suspend payment of any amount which it disputes in good faith or for which it has not been provided with reasonable details as set forth above until resolution thereof. Tenant also covenants and agrees to pay, when due, all taxes arising out of the operation of Tenant's business.

Tenant shall have the right, at any time or from time to time during the Term of this Lease, to remove such trade fixtures or equipment. If such removal damages any part of the Premises, Tenant shall repair such damages.

If such lien is filed against the Premises, and even if Tenant contests it, Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days after notice from Landlord of its filing, bond over such lien. In the event of any contest or protest of such lien by Tenant, unless required to do so to prevent a default under any mortgage upon the Premises, Landlord shall not pay the claimant or discharge the lien on Tenant's account, and shall have no right to seek reimbursement of such payments if it does. Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlor d harmless from and against all Indemnified Costs relating to or resulting from such liens.

The parties agree to obtain waiver of subrogation clauses in each of their respective insurance policies in order to carry out these release provisions.

^^General Requirements  
^All insurance provided for in this Article 18 shall be effected under standard form policies issued by insurers of recognized responsibility authorized to do business in the state in which the Premises are located; provided, however, that Tenant may self-insure any of the amounts herein stated pursuant to a bona fide self-insurance retention program so long as Tenant's tangible net worth as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied exceeds $[[USD Value 10: Number]]

Tenant and Landlord shall cooperate with each other in connection with the collection of any insurance monies that may be due in the event of loss and Landlord shall execute and deliver to Tenant such proofs of loss and other instruments which may be required for the purpose of obtaining the recovery of any such insurance monies.

^^Indemnification  
^For purposes of this Section, Landlord and Tenant shall be deemed to be "responsible" for their respective officers, directors, agents and employees acting within the scope of their duties. Subject to the provisions of Section 18.3, Tenant will indemnify and hold Landlord and the parties for whom Landlord is responsible harmless from any and all Indemnified Costs arising from a third party claim respecting an incident which occurred within the Premises during the Term and which resulted in personal or bodily injury or property damage unless resulting from the negligent acts or omissions of Landlord or any party for whom Landlord is responsible.

^In case any action or proceeding is brought against Landlord or a party for which it is responsible and such claim is a claim from which Tenant is obligated to indemnify Landlord pursuant to this Section, Tenant, upon notice from Landlord, shall resist and defend such action or proceeding (by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord).

\centered Ex. H, pg. 32

^^Delay in Repair  
^Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if in Tenant's reasonable judgment any damage or destruction to the Premises or any portion of the Landlord’s Parcel which materially and/or adversely affects Tenant's use of the Premises from any cause whatsoever cannot be repaired within two hundred ten (210) days following the date such damage occurs or if any damage or destruction to the Premises or any portion of the Landlord’s Parcel which materially and/or adversely affects Tenant's use of the Premises is not actually repaired within two hundred ten (210) days following the date such damage occurs (which period shall be subject to extension for Force Majeure), Tenant may terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord given within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of such damage or within thirty (30) days of the expiration of such two hundred ten (210) day period (but no later than the date Landlord Substantially Completes the restoration required under this Article 20).

^In addition, if any damage or destruction to the Premises from any cause whatsoever cannot be repaired, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, within one hundred fifty (150) days following the date such damage occurs (which period shall not be subject to extension for Force Majeure), Landlord may elect not to repair such damage and to terminate this Lease by written notice to Tenant given within forty-five (45) days after the date such damage occurred, provided Landlord may only terminate if no more than three (3) calendar years remain in the Term hereof. If Landlord fails to terminate this Lease and does not promptly commence its repairs and thereafter complete its repair and restoration work of the Premises under this Section within one hundred fifty (150) d ays following the date such damage occurs (the "**Restoration Period**"), Tenant may, but shall have no obligation to, perform any or all repairs or restoration work of the Premises on Landlord's behalf as Landlord's agent (but Landlord shall remain responsible for such work), in which event Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the actual costs incurred by Tenant within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice therefor. If Landlord fails to pay such costs within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice therefor, then in addition to all other rights and remedies that Tenant may have against Landlord (but without duplication in recovering the amounts due Tenant), Tenant shall be entitled to deduct the unpaid and overdue amount of such costs from the Rent otherwise becoming due hereunder, together with interest on the unpaid balance thereof at the Default Rate from the date originally due.

^Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time Landlord gives such termination notice any of the renewal options provided for in this Lease have not yet been exercised and Tenant exercises a renewal option within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlord's termination notice, then this Lease shall not be terminated and Landlord shall promptly commence restoration of the Premises. Tenant shall have the right to elect to perform any nonstructural improvements to the Premises, in which event the proceeds of Landlord's property insurance applicable to the nonstructural improvements shall be promptly made available and released to Tenant. If this Lease is terminated, such termination shall be effective thirty (30) days following the giving of notice thereof. In such event, neither party shall have any obligation to perform any repair or restoration work.

If all or any part of the Premises, including any taking of access thereto, which materially and adversely impairs Tenant's use of the Premises shall be taken under the power or threat of eminent domain, Tenant may terminate this Lease upon written notice to Landlord. Landlord shall give Tenant written notice promptly upon Landlord learning of a potential taking of any portion of the Landlord’s Parcel. If Tenant does not terminate this Lease pursuant to this Article 21, Landlord shall make such repairs and alterations as may be necessary in order to restore the part of the Premises and/or Landlord’s Parcel, as applicable, not taken to a condition consistent with the condition prior to such taking and all Rent due hereunder shall be equitably reduced as of the date of the taking. All compens ation awards for any taking of the Premises shall belong solely to and be the property of Landlord, and Tenant assigns to Landlord all of Tenant’s rights with respect thereto. However, Tenant may apply for reimbursement from the condemning authority (if permitted by Legal Requirements) for moving expenses, removal of trade fixtures, or loss of Tenant’s business good will, provided that such reimbursement shall not reduce the amount of the award otherwise recoverable from the condemning authority by Landlord.

^^Consent  
^Tenant shall have the right, without the consent of Landlord, to (1) grant licenses and/or concessions within the Premises or (2) assign this Lease or sublet all or any portion of the Premises to a Related Party, so long as such party's proposed use does not violate an Existing Exclusive, provided that the holder thereof is operating in its premises consistent with the terms of its lease and provided further that Tenant shall not be released from liability, but shall remain liable hereunder. **"Related Party"** means (1) an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Tenant, (2) a successor by merger, acquisition or consolidation of Tenant or its parent or subsidiary, or (3) an entity acquiring all or substantially all of the stores of Tenant in the state of New Hampshire or the assets of Tenant, its parent or subsidiary.

^Except as described in Section 22.1(A), Tenant shall not assign Tenant's interest in this Lease or sublet all or any portion of the Premises without Landlord's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

^Any such assignee or sublessee shall be bound by the terms of this Lease, except as otherwise approved by Landlord. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord in the ordinary course of its business an instrument whereby the assignee or entity succeeding to Tenant's interest agrees to be bound by the terms of this Lease.

^^Release of Liability  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, Tenant shall not be released from all liability as a result of any assignment or sublease.

^^Transfer by Landlord  
Landlord may assign Landlord's interest in this Lease without the consent of Tenant (A) to any entity to which Landlord transfers its fee interest in the Premises, provided such entity agrees in writing to be bound by all the terms of this Lease, or (B) subject to Article 24, as security for any Mortgage.

^^Protections  
^If Tenant assigns Tenant's interest in this Lease, then Landlord, when giving notice to such assignee or any future assignee in respect of any default, shall also give a copy of such notice to the original named Tenant hereunder ("**Original Tenant**"), and no notice of default shall be effective until a copy thereof is so given to Original Tenant. Original Tenant shall have the same period after receipt of such notice to cure such default as is given to Tenant therefor under this Lease.

^If this Lease is terminated because of: (a) an event of default of such assignee, or (b) the rejection, disaffirmation, or other termination of this Lease by or on behalf of the assignee pursuant to any proceeding in bankruptcy under any legal requirement of any state or of the United States, or any other legal requirements affecting creditors' rights, then Landlord shall promptly give to Original Tenant notice thereof, and Original Tenant shall have the right, exercisable by notice given to Landlord within fifteen (15) days after receipt by Original Tenant of Landlord's notice, to enter into a new lease of the Premises with Landlord ("**New Lease**"), provided that the Original Tenant shall have remedied all events of default of the assignee hereunder, unless such events of default are not reasonably susceptible of cure by the Original Tenant, in which event the Original Tenant shall not be obligated to cure such events of default as a condition to the exercise of its rights under this Section 22.5(B). Upon the Original Tenant's curing of any such event of default of the assignee, Landlord shall assign to the Original Tenant all of Landlord's rights against such assignee (whether arising as a result of bankruptcy court proceedings or otherwise). The term of such New Lease shall begin on the date of termination of this Lease and shall continue for the remainder of the Term (including any renewal periods). Such New Lease shall otherwise contain the same terms and conditions as those set forth herein, except for requirements which are no longer applicable or have already been performed. It is the intention of the parties hereto that such New Lease shall have the same priority relative to other rights or interests in or to the Premises as this Lease. The provisions of this Section 22.5(B) shall survive the termination of this Lease and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter to the same extent as if this Section 22.5(B) were a separate and independent contract between Landlord and the Original Tenant. From the date on which the Original Tenant shall serve Landlord with such notice of the exercise of its right to a New Lease, the Original Tenant shall have quiet and undisturbed use and enjoyment of the Premises and all appurtenances thereto, as contemplated in this Lease.

^If Tenant subleases all or any portion of the Premises for a term of at least five (5) years, then, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Lease, Landlord shall, upon Tenant's request, execute and deliver a recognition agreement among Landlord, Tenant and each such subtenant whereby Landlord agrees to recognize the rights of such subtenant upon default by Tenant hereunder; such recognition agreement shall be in recordable form and otherwise reasonably acceptable to Landlord.

^^Default by Tenant  
^The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a default under this Lease by Tenant:

^Any failure by Tenant to pay any Rent or other charge required to be paid under this Lease and such failure continues for a period of ten (10) days after Tenant's receipt of written notice thereof from Landlord; provided that Landlord shall not be required to provide Tenant with notice of failure to pay Minimum Rent or CAM Charges more than two (2) times in any twelve (12) month period, and any subsequent failures in such twelve (12) month period to pay in full Minimum Rent or CAM Charges on the day the same is due shall constitute a default without the requirement of notice; or

\centered Ex. H, pg. 35

^Any failure by Tenant to observe or perform any other provision, covenant or condition of this Lease to be observed or performed by Tenant and such failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant, provided, however, that if the nature of such default is such that the same cannot reasonably be cured within a thirty (30) day period, Tenant shall not be deemed to be in default if it shall commence such cure within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter rectify and cure such default with due diligence; or

^To the extent permitted by law, a general assignment by Tenant for the benefit of creditors, or the filing by or against Tenant of any proceeding under any insolvency or bankruptcy law, unless, in the case of a proceeding filed against Tenant, the same is dismissed within ninety (90) days, or the appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of all or substantially all of the assets of Tenant, unless possession is restored to Tenant within ninety (90) days, or any execution or other judicially authorized seizure of all or substantially all of Tenant's assets located upon the Premises or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, unless the seizure is discharged within ninety (90) days.

^^Remedies of Landlord  
^In the event of a default by Tenant, Landlord, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, at its option may upon written notice to Tenant, provided the subject default shall not have been cured on or before the date such notice is given:

^Declare the Term hereof ended and reenter the Premises and take possession thereof and remove all persons therefrom, and Tenant shall have no further claim thereon or thereunder; or

^Without declaring the Term hereof ended, reenter the Premises and occupy the whole or any part thereof; or

^Even though it may have reentered the Premises, thereafter elect to terminate this Lease and all of the rights of Tenant in or to the Premises.

^Should Landlord reenter the Premises under the provisions listed above, Landlord shall not be deemed to be terminating this Lease, or to be terminating Tenant's liability for damages under any of the provisions hereof, by any such reentry or by any action in unlawful detainer or otherwise to obtain possession of the Premises, unless Landlord notifies Tenant in writing that it has so elected to terminate this Lease.

^In the event that Landlord repossesses the Premises hereunder and terminates this Lease, Landlord agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to relet the Premises upon such terms as Landlord determines are appropriate in its reasonable discretion, and Landlord may recover from Tenant as damages: (i) all of Landlord's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining possession of the Premises and reletting the Premises, including reasonable attorneys' fees, outside brokerage commissions and the cost of any repairs required to be made to the Premises which are Tenant's obligations hereunder, and (ii) the difference between the Rent thereafter becoming due under the Lease, and the proceeds from reletting the Premises, such deficiency to be computed and paid mo nthly at the times that Rent is payable hereunder. Whether or not this Lease or Tenant's right to possession is terminated by Landlord or by any provision of law or court decree, Tenant shall have no obligation to pay any Rent until the date it would otherwise have become due in the absence of any default. Landlord shall have no right to accelerate (i.e., declare the same immediately due and payable) any Rent which would have become due in the future ("**Future Rent**"). In the event Landlord terminates this Lease, Tenant's liability for Future Rent (as well as any damages specifically in lieu of or representing such Future Rent) shall not cease, but shall continue as set forth above in this Section. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, in no event is Landlord entitled to: (a) accelerate Rent; or (b) exercise self help to lock out Tenant or forcibly retake possession of the Premises without due legal process and an app ropriate court order.

\centered Ex. H, pg. 36

^Any Rent not paid when due shall bear interest beginning ten (10) days after the due date at the Default Rate, or until payment is received by Landlord. Acceptance of such late charges and interest payments shall not be deemed consent by Landlord to late payments, nor a waiver of Landlord’s right to insist upon timely payments at any time, nor a waiver of any remedies to which Landlord is entitled as a result of the late payment of Rent.

^^Default by Landlord  
Landlord shall be in default of this Lease if Landlord fails to perform any of its obligations under this Lease within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Tenant specifying such failure in the case of non-monetary obligations, provided, however, that if the nature of such default is such that it cannot reasonably be cured within such period, then, upon notice to Tenant, Landlord shall have such additional time as is reasonably required to cure such default, provided that Landlord commences to cure the default within such period and proceeds to complete such cure with diligence and continuity. If Landlord fails to perform its obligations as set forth above, Tenant may, at its option, in addition to any other remedies at law or equity, incur any expense necessary to perform the obligations of Landlord specified in such notice on Landlord's behalf as Landlord's agent (but Landlord shall remain responsible for such work), in which event Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the actual costs incurred by Tenant within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice therefor. If Landlord fails to pay such costs within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice therefor, then in addition to all other rights and remedies that Tenant may have against Landlord (but without duplication in recovering the amounts due Tenant), Tenant shall be entitled to deduct the unpaid and overdue amount of such costs from the Rent otherwise becoming due hereunder, together with interest on the unpaid balance thereof at the Default Rate from the date originally due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not have the right to make any repairs on behalf of Landlord outside of the Premises other than the Common Areas within ten (10) feet of the Premises. If Landlord’s default materially affects Tenant’s business, a s reasonably determined by Tenant and such default continues for thirty (30) days after a second written notice from Landlord to Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon written notice to Landlord.

^^Non-Disturbance Agreement  
Tenant agrees and acknowledges that this Lease shall be subject and subordinate to any and all mortgages and deeds of trust (“**Mortgages**”) that may now or hereafter affect this Lease or the Premises, and to all terms, provisions, renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof. Such subordination shall be automatic and self-operative and no further instrument of subordination shall be necessary unless required by any mortgagee in which event Tenant agrees, within ten (10) days after request by Landlord or the mortgagee, to execute any agreement reasonably required by such mortgagee to memorialize such subordination, provided that such agreement shall provide that, for so long as Tenant has fully and faithfully performed all of th e terms conditions, covenants and obligations set forth in this Lease, Tenant’s right to use and occupy the Premises shall remain nondisturbed by the mortgagee and those acting by or through the mortgagee. Tenant further agrees to attorn to any successor to Landlord’s interest in the Premises, including any mortgagee, ground lessor or future holder of a mortgage or to any purchase at foreclosure (or by deed in lieu of foreclosure) (“**Mortgagee**”) upon all of the terms and conditions of this Lease.

^^Force Majeure  
^If either party hereto is delayed or hindered in or prevented from the performance of any obligation required hereunder by Force Majeure, the time for performance of such obligation shall be extended for the period of the delay, provided that Force Majeure shall not excuse prompt and timely payments when due under this Lease except when (a) the Rent Commencement Date is delayed by reason of Force Majeure, or (b) such payment is excused pursuant to other provisions of this Lease. However, no delay shall be excused by this Section unless (i) the delayed party notifies the other party in writing of the delay within five (5) business days of the event giving rise to such delay, (ii) the delayed party has exhausted all other resources available at reasonable co sts to avoid such delay, and (iii) the delayed party diligently pursues completion of the activity which was delayed.

\centered Ex. H, pg. 39

"Severe Weather" means weather that a reasonable person would find unusual and unanticipated at the time of the scheduling of the activity based on recent weather patterns for the period in question in the vicinity of the Premises, provided that the delayed party delivers to the other party, upon request, reasonable documentation from an unbiased weather authority substantiating such claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, under no circumstances shall Force Majeure extend the time for performance of any obligation by more than three (3) months.

^^Brokers  
Landlord and Tenant each represent to the other that they have not entered into any agreement or incurred any obligation in connection with this transaction which might result in the obligation to pay a brokerage commission to any broker other than American Retail Properties, for whose commissions and fees Landlord is solely responsible. Each party shall indemnify and hold the other party harmless from and against any other claim or demand by any other broker or other person for bringing about this Lease who claims to have dealt with such indemnifying party, including all expenses incurred in defending any such claim or demand (including reasonable attorneys' fees).

No notice delivered to the Premises shall be effective. Either party may change its address for notices by notice in the manner set forth above, given at least thirty (30) days in advance. The telephone numbers identified under the notice addresses are for informational purposes only and not for purposes of giving notice under this Lease. All such consents, waivers, notices, demands, requests or other instruments shall be deemed given upon receipt thereof or upon the refusal of the addressee to receive the same.

^Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice from Tenant of its election to exercise any right to extend the Term or terminate this Lease shall be deemed effective as of the earliest to occur of (1) the date on which the notice is served personally; or (2) the date on which the notice is sent by fax, provided a copy of the notice is promptly sent by overnight courier or by certified United States mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; or (3) the postmark date for U.S. mail, or (4) the date on which Federal Express or a similar reputable express courier accepts receipt of the notice.

^^Advertising and Trademarks  
Tenant shall not be required to advertise its business in any manner nor participate in or pay any charges for any advertisement or promotion of any kind nor participate in Shopping Center events of any kind, including, without limitation, any sales or price reductions of its merchandise or the giving away of its merchandise or anything of value, without Tenant's consent in each instance, which consent may be withheld by Tenant in its sole discretion.

Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, under no circumstances do the parties to this Lease intend to limit or otherwise affect in any way the ability or right of Tenant and Tenant's affiliates to open, operate, merchandise or close any stores anywhere, regardless of the proximity to the Premises or the potential or actual affect of the opening, operation, merchandising or closing of such stores, and further regardless of any obligations or rights based on the sales generated at the Premises expressly set forth in this Lease.

\centered Ex. H, pg. 41

^^Interpretation  
^This Lease and the Exhibits attached hereto set forth the entire understanding between the parties concerning the subject matter of this Lease and incorporate all prior negotiations and understandings. There are no covenants, promises, agreements, conditions or understandings, either oral or written, between them relating to the subject matter of this Lease other than set forth herein. Each party agrees that this Lease is the result of good faith negotiations and shall be interpreted as though it were drafted by both parties.

^This Lease shall be governed and construed exclusively by the provisions hereof and in accordance with the laws of the state in which the Premises are located.

^Nothing contained in this Lease shall be deemed or construed by the parties hereto or by any third person to create the relationship of principal and agent or partnership joint venture or of any association between Landlord and Tenant, and neither the method of computation of Rent nor any other provision contained in this Lease nor any acts of the parties hereto shall be deemed to create any relationship between Landlord and Tenant other than the relationship of landlord and tenant.

^The waiver by either party of any breach of any term, covenant or condition herein contained shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such term, covenant or condition or any subsequent breach of the same or any other term, covenant or condition herein contained. The subsequent acceptance of Rent or other sums hereunder by either party shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding breach by the other party of any term, covenant or condition of this Lease other than the failure to pay the particular Rent or other sum so accepted, regardless of the accepting party's knowledge of such preceding breach at the time of acceptance of such Rent or other sum.

^If any term, covenant or condition of this Lease or the application thereof to any person, firm or corporation, or circumstance, shall be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Lease or the application of such term, covenant or condition to persons, firms, or corporations, or circumstances, other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall be both unaffected thereby and each term, covenant or condition of this Lease shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

^The various rights, options, elections, powers and remedies contained in this Lease shall be construed as cumulative and no one of them shall be exclusive of any of the others, or any other legal or equitable remedy which either party might otherwise have in the event of breach or default in the terms hereof. The exercise of one right or remedy by a party shall not impair its right to any other right or remedy until all obligations imposed upon the other party have been fully performed.

^The headings and Section numbers appearing in this Lease are inserted as a matter of convenience. They do not define, limit, construe or describe the scope or intent of the provisions of this Lease.

^^Disputes  
^The parties expressly agree that in the event of any dispute under this Lease, other than with respect to the payment of Minimum Rent or any other amount due hereunder as to which the amount due itself is not subject to a good faith dispute, before any party commences litigation against the other party under this Lease, senior officers of each of Landlord and Tenant shall have first discussed the issues in dispute with each other and failed to resolve the same within thirty (30) days of the original notice of default or request for such discussion by one party, whichever is earlier.

^Subject to the foregoing, if either party commences litigation against the other arising out of or in connection with this Lease, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to its costs of suit and reasonable attorneys' fees as may be awarded by the court. Each of Tenant and Landlord and their respective agents expressly waive any claims, and shall not be awarded any judgments, for consequential, special, punitive or similar-type damages, except those resulting from the inaccuracy or untruthfulness of its representations or warranties expressly set forth in this Lease or as otherwise expressly stated in this Lease. With respect to any litigation arising out of or in connection with this Lease, Landlord and Tenant hereby expressly waive the r ight to a trial by jury.

^^Accord and Satisfaction  
No payment by either party or receipt by the other party of a lesser amount than the sums herein reserved shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest stipulated sum, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check be deemed an accord and satisfaction.

^^Landlord's Liability  
If Landlord fails to perform any covenant, term or condition of this Lease upon Landlord's part to be performed, and if as a consequence of such default Tenant shall recover a money judgment against Landlord, such judgment shall be satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received upon execution of such judgment and levied thereon against the right, title and interest of Landlord in the Landlord’s Parcel and out of rents, issues or other income from such property receivable by Landlord, or out of the consideration received by Landlord from the sale or other disposition of all or any part of Landlord's right, title and interest in the Landlord’s Parcel. The foregoing limitations shall not (1) limit or affect Tenant's right to seek injunctive, equitable or other remedies against Landlord and shall not prohibit a court from issuing or awarding or ordering any injunctive or other equitable, declaratory or other forms of relief to which Tenant may be entitled (notwithstanding that such actions are in personam in nature) which relief may include an award of or order for (A) money damages as incident to such equitable or other relief, and (B) the expenditure of money by Landlord in order to comply with the equitable decree or other relief or reimburse Tenant for any loss on account of Landlord's failure or inability to comply therewith or cost of enforcement thereof; or (2) apply to or limit any suit or action in connection with enforcement or collection of amounts which may become owing or payable under or on account of insurance maintained by Landlord or any eminent domain proceeds payable to Landlord, in either case to the extent of available proceeds, but the recovery of any money judgment against Landlord shall be subject to the first sentence of this Section.

\centered Ex. H, pg. 43

^^Leasehold Financing  
^Landlord acknowledges and agrees that Tenant may from time to time during the Term, without the consent of Landlord, mortgage or otherwise finance and encumber, whether by leasehold deed of trust or mortgage, collateral assignment of this Lease, lease/sublease-back, and/or assignment/leaseback, any and/or all of its leasehold estate hereunder, and property and rights in and to the Premises granted to it under this Lease, as security for the payment of an indebtedness (any and all of which are herein referred to as a "Leasehold Mortgage" and the holder thereof is herein referred to as "Leasehold Mortgagee"), provided the Leasehold Mortgage contains the provision set forth in paragraph 26.16(B) below. Any such Leasehold Mortgage shall be a lien only upon Ten ant's leasehold estate hereunder and Tenant's interests in this Lease and shall not encumber Landlord's fee simple title to the Shopping Center or the Premises. Pursuant to any such Leasehold Mortgage, the Leasehold Mortgagee or another person or entity (a "Successor-Tenant") may acquire title to Tenant's interest in the leasehold estate in the Premises in any lawful way, including, but not limited to, through foreclosure, assignment in lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise. In such event, the Successor-Tenant shall succeed to the rights of Tenant under this Lease, including the right to possession of the Premises, in which event Landlord shall recognize the Successor-Tenant as Tenant under this Lease, the same as if such Successor-Tenant were the original Tenant hereunder. Tenant shall notify Landlord, in the manner hereinafter provided for the giving of notice, of the execution of such Leasehold Mortgage and the name and place for service of notice upon Leasehold Mortgagee. Upo n such notification of Landlord that Tenant has entered into a Leasehold Mortgage, Landlord hereby agrees for the benefit of such Leasehold Mortgagee, and upon written request by Tenant, to execute and deliver to Tenant and Leasehold Mortgagee an agreement whereby Landlord agrees to recognize the interest of Leasehold Mortgagee and any Successor-Tenant hereunder, on commercially reasonable terms and conditions acceptable to Leasehold Mortgagee. Landlord does hereby waive any statutory or other lien of Landlord in Tenant's present and after-acquired assets, including among other things, Tenant's inventory and equipment.

^Any Leasehold Mortgage shall be released of record within thirty (30) days after the satisfaction or termination of the obligations of Tenant to the Leasehold Mortgagee, and in the event of the failure of the Leasehold Mortgagee to cause the Leasehold Mortgage to be so released of record within such thirty (30) day period, Landlord may demand that the Leasehold Mortgagee or Tenant cause the Leasehold Mortgage to be released, and if Leasehold Mortgagee fails to do so within thirty (30) days following such request by Landlord, the Tenant may execute and cause to be recorded in the real estate records or other records where the Leasehold Mortgage is recorded, an affidavit stating that the Leasehold Mortgage has been satisfied in full and is no longer a lien (a “Leasehold Mortgage Release Affidavit”). A Leasehold Mortgage Release Affidavit executed by Tenant and recorded in the real estate or other records where the Leasehold Mortgage is recorded shall be sufficient to cause the Leasehold Mortgage to be released of record and void in all respects as a lien against the estate of Tenant under this Lease. The failure of Leasehold Mortgagee to cause the Leasehold Mortgage to be released of record or of Tenant to execute and record a Leasehold Mortgage Release Affidavit within thirty (30) days after demand by Landlord shall constitute a default by Tenant under this Lease.

^^Prohibited Persons and Transactions

To the best of its knowledge, neither Tenant nor any Affiliate is listed, controlled by, or acting for, or on behalf of any person or entity, appearing on the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control list of restrictions and prohibited persons or any replacement thereof (the **"OFAC List"**).
