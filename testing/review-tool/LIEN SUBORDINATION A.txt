^\centered Subordination of Junior Liens 

^Subordination of Junior Liens. (a) All Junior Liens in respect of any Collateral are expressly subordinated and made junior in right, priority, operation and effect to any and all Senior Liens in respect of such Collateral, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the Note Indenture, any Junior Obligations Security Document or any other agreement or instrument to the contrary, and irrespective of the time, order or method of creation, attachment or perfection of such Junior Liens and Senior Liens or any defect or deficiency or alleged defect or deficiency in any of the foregoing. 

^^It is acknowledged that (i) the aggregate amount of the Senior Obligations may be increased as provided in Article III or through increases in the amounts of the facilities established by the Credit Agreement or the Designated Senior Obligations Governing Documents (subject to the limitations set forth in the Note Indenture), (ii) a portion of the Senior Obligations consists or may consist of Indebtedness that is revolving in nature, and the amount thereof that may be outstanding at any time or from time to time may be increased or reduced and subsequently reborrowed and (iii) the Senior Obligations may be extended, renewed or otherwise amended or modified, or secured with additional Collateral, from time to time, all without affecting the subordination of the Junior Liens hereunder or the provisions of this Agreement defining the relative rights of the Senior Obligations Secured Parties and the Junior Obligations Secured Parties. The lien priorities provided for herein shall not be altered or otherwise affected by any amendment, modification, supplement, extension, increase, replacement, renewal, restatement or refinancing of either the Junior 

Obligations or the Senior Obligations, by the securing of any Senior Obligations with any additional Collateral or guarantees, by the release of any Collateral or Guarantees securing any Senior Obligations, by the failure of any person to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any agreement evidencing, governing or securing any Senior Obligation or Junior Obligation or by any action that any Collateral Agent or Secured Party may take or fail to take in respect of any Collateral. 

^^It is further acknowledged that the holders of Senior Obligations of one or more classes may from time to time hereafter enter into agreements establishing the relative priorities of such classes of Senior Obligations or of the Senior Liens securing the same. It is agreed that the relative priorities of classes of Senior Obligations shall be governed by the foregoing agreements or, to the extent not determined by such agreements, by applicable law, and that nothing in this Agreement shall affect such relative priorities of classes of Senior Obligations or the related Senior Liens. It is further agreed that no agreements establishing the relative priorities of Senior Obligations of one or more classes or of the Senior Liens securing such Senior Obligations shall in any way limit or affect the subordination of the Junior Liens provided for in this Agreement or the provisions of this Agreement defining the relative rights of the Senior Obligations Secured Parties and the Junior Obligations Secured Parties. 

^^It is further acknowledged that (subject to the limitations set forth in the Note Indenture) the Senior Obligations are or may in the future be secured by Liens on collateral other than the Collateral subject to the Junior Liens. It is agreed that no Senior Collateral Agent will have any obligation to proceed against any such other collateral securing the Senior Obligations or to exercise any other remedies available to them as a condition to obtaining the benefits of this Article II. 

^^The Note Collateral Agent confirms that the Note Indenture and the Note Security Documents contain provisions substantially to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto under which the Note Secured Parties agree to, and subject their rights to the provisions of, this Agreement. 

^No Action With Respect to Junior Obligations Collateral Subject to Senior Liens. No Junior Collateral Agent or other Junior Obligations Secured Party shall commence or instruct the Junior Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Junior 

Obligations Collateral under any Junior Obligations Security Document, applicable law or otherwise, at any time when such Junior Obligations Collateral shall be subject to any Senior Lien and prior to the Discharge of Senior Obligations, it being agreed that only the applicable Senior Collateral Agent, acting in accordance with the applicable Senior Obligations Security Documents, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such remedies. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary provided in Section 2.06, the Junior Collateral Agent may, subject to Section 2.05, (i) take all such actions as it shall deem necessary to continue the perfection of the Junior Liens on any Junior Obligations Collateral, (ii) file a claim or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Obligations in any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding or (iii) take any other action not adverse to the Senior Liens in order to preserve or protect its rights in the Junior Liens on the Collateral for the benefit of the Junior Obligations Secured Parties. 

^No Duties of Senior Collateral Agents. Each Junior Obligations Secured Party acknowledges and agrees that no Senior Collateral Agent or other Senior Obligations Secured Party shall have any duties or other obligations to such Junior Obligations Secured Party with respect to any Senior Obligations Collateral, other than to transfer to the Junior Collateral Agent any proceeds of any such Collateral that constitutes Junior Obligations Collateral remaining in its possession following any sale, transfer or other disposition of such Collateral and the Discharge of Senior Obligations, or, if any Senior Collateral Agent shall be in possession of all or any part of such Collateral after the Discharge of Senior Obligations, such Collateral or any part thereof remaining, in each case without representation or warranty on the part of such Senior Collateral Agent or any Senior Obligations Secured Party (it being understood that nothing herein shall prohibit any Senior Collateral Agent from transferring Collateral or proceeds of Collateral to the holders of other Senior Obligations secured by such Collateral or to another Senior Collateral Agent acting on their behalf to the extent it is required to do so under the terms of any agreement). In furtherance of the foregoing, each Junior Obligations Secured Party acknowledges and agrees that until the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the applicable Senior Collateral Agents shall be entitled, for the benefit of the holders of such Senior Obligations, to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of or deal with such Collateral as provided herein and in the Credit Facilities Security Documents or the Designated Senior Obligations Security Documents, as the case may be, without regard to any Junior Lien or any rights to which the holders of the Junior Obligations would otherwise be entitled as a result of such Junior Lien. Without limiting the foregoing, each Junior Obligations Secured Party agrees that no Senior Collateral Agent or other Senior Obligations Secured Party shall have any duty or obligation first to marshall or realize upon any type of Collateral (or any other collateral securing the Senior Obligations), or to sell, dispose of or otherwise liquidate all or any portion of the Collateral (or any other collateral securing the Senior Obligations), in any manner that would maximize the return to the Junior Obligations Secured Parties, notwithstanding that the order and timing of any such realization, sale, disposition or liquidation may affect the amount of proceeds actually received by the Junior Obligations Secured Parties from such realization, sale, disposition or liquidation. Each of the Junior Obligations Secured Parties waives any claim such Junior Obligations Secured Party may now or hereafter have against any Senior Collateral Agent or other Senior Obligations Secured Party (or their representatives) arising out of (i) any actions which any Senior Collateral Agent or the Senior Obligations Secured Parties take or omit to take (including, without limitation, actions with respect to the creation, perfection or continuation of Liens on any Collateral, actions with respect to the foreclosure upon, sale, release or depreciation of, or failure to realize upon, any of the Collateral and actions with respect to the collection of any claim for all or any part of the Senior Obligations from any account debtor, guarantor or any other party) in accordance with the respective Senior Obligations Security Documents or any other agreement related thereto or to the collection of the Senior Obligations or the valuation, use, protection or release of any security for the Senior Obligations, (ii) any election by any Senior Collateral Agent or Senior Obligations Secured Parties, in any proceeding instituted under the Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and/or (iii) any borrowing of any Grantor as debtor-in-possession, or any related grant of a security interest or administrative expense priority under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code. 

^No Interference; Payment Over; Reinstatement. (a) Each Junior Obligations Secured Party agrees that (i) it will not take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or effect of which is, or could be, to make any Junior Lien pari passu with, or to give such Junior Obligations Secured Party any preference or priority relative to, any Senior Lien with respect to the Collateral subject to such Junior Lien or any part thereof, (ii) it will not challenge or question in any proceeding the validity or enforceability of any Senior Obligations or Senior Obligations Security Document, or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of any Senior Lien, or the validity or enforceability of the priorities, rights or duties established by or other provisions of this Agreement, (iii) it will not interfere, hinder or delay, in any manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Collateral subject to such Junior Lien by any holders of Senior Obligations secured by such Collateral or any Senior Collateral Agent acting on their behalf, (iv) it shall have no right to (A) direct any Senior Collateral Agent or any holder of Senior Obligations to exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to the Collateral subject to any Junior Lien or (B) consent to the exercise by any Senior Collateral Agent or any holder of Senior Obligations of any right, remedy or power with respect to the Collateral subject to any Junior Lien, (v) it will not institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against any Senior Collateral Agent or any holder of Senior Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to, and neither any Senior Collateral Agent nor any holder of Senior Obligations shall be liable for, any action taken or omitted to be taken by such Senior Collateral Agent or any such holder of Senior Obligations with respect to any Collateral securing such Senior Obligations that is subject to any Junior Lien, (vi) it will not seek, and hereby waives any right, to have any Senior Obligations Collateral subject to any Junior Lien or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral and (vii) it will not attempt, directly or indirectly, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to challenge the enforceability of any provision of this Agreement. 

^^The Junior Collateral Agent and each other Junior Obligations Secured Party hereby agrees that if it shall obtain possession of any Senior Obligations Collateral, or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral, whether pursuant to any Junior Obligations Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding or otherwise, at any time prior to the Discharge of Senior Obligations, then it shall hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the applicable Senior Obligations Secured Parties and transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the applicable Senior Collateral Agent. Each Junior Obligations Secured Party agrees that if, at any time, all or part of any payment with respect to any Senior Obligations previously made shall be rescinded for any reason whatsoever, such Junior Obligations Secured Party shall promptly pay over to the applicable Senior Collateral Agent any payment received by it in respect of any Collateral subject to any Senior Lien securing such Senior Obligations and shall promptly turn any Collateral subject to any such Senior Lien then held by it over to the applicable Senior Collateral Agent, and the provisions set forth in this Agreement shall be reinstated as if such payment had not been made, until the Discharge of Senior Obligations. 

^Automatic Release of Junior Liens. The Junior Collateral Agent and each other Junior Obligations Secured Party agrees that, in the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition of Senior Obligations Collateral subject to any Junior Lien to a person or entity that is not the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, such Junior Lien on such Collateral (but not on the proceeds thereof, except to the extent such proceeds are applied to repay any Senior Obligations) shall terminate and be released automatically and without further action if the applicable Senior Liens on such Collateral are released. Each Junior Collateral Agent agrees to execute and deliver all such releases and other instruments as shall reasonably be requested by any applicable Senior Collateral Agent to evidence and confirm any release of Junior Obligations Collateral provided for in this Section. 

^Certain Agreements With Respect to Bankruptcy or Insolvency Proceedings. In the event a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any other Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law shall be commenced by or against any Grantor, each Junior Collateral Agent and the other Junior Obligations Secured Parties shall not, prior to the Discharge of Senior Obligations, (a) seek in respect of any part of the Collateral or proceeds thereof or any Lien which may exist thereon any relief from or modification of the automatic stay as provided in Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or seek or accept any form of adequate protection under either or both Sections 362 and 363 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect thereto except replacement liens junior to the Senior Liens and the accrual (but not the current payment) of interest and the current payment of out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel and other professional advisors, incurred by the Junior Collateral Agents (which the Junior Obligations Secured Parties agree will constitute adequate protection of their claims and interests), (b) oppose or object to any adequate protection sought by or granted to any Senior Obligations Secured Party in connection with the use of cash collateral or post-petition financing under Section 362, 363 or 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, (c) oppose or object to the use of cash collateral by a Grantor, (d) oppose or object to any post-petition financing (including any debtor-in-possession financing) provided by any of the Senior Obligations Secured Parties or provided by a third party pursuant to Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code (including on a priming basis), (e) oppose or object to or withhold consent from the disposition of assets by any Grantor under Section 363(b) or (f) of the Bankruptcy Code, (f) oppose, object to, or vote against any plan of reorganization or disclosure statement the terms of which are consistent with the rights of the Senior Obligations Secured Parties under the Senior Obligations Security Documents and the rights of the Senior Obligations Secured Parties and the Junior Obligations Secured Parties under this Agreement, (g) make an election pursuant to Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or oppose any election pursuant to Section 1111(b) by any Senior Obligations Secured Parties, (h) oppose or object to the determination of the extent of any Liens held by any of the Senior Obligations Secured Parties or the value of any claims of Senior Obligations Secured Parties under Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, or (i) oppose or object to the payment of interest and expenses as provided under Sections 506(b) and (c) of the Bankruptcy Code to any Senior Obligations Secured Parties. In any proceeding described in this Section, until the Discharge of Senior Obligations, each Junior Obligations Secured Party hereby authorizes and empowers (without imposing an obligation on) the holders of such Senior Obligations or any Senior Collateral Agent or other Representative acting on their behalf to vote such Junior Obligations Secured Party’s share of the Junior Obligations secured by such Junior Lien, insofar as any such voting right arises from or relates to such Junior Lien or to the Collateral subject thereto, in connection with any resolution, arrangement, plan of reorganization, compromise or settlement relating to such Collateral, so long as the proposal is consistent with the rights of the Senior Obligations Secured Parties under the Senior Obligations Security Documents and the rights of the Senior Obligations Secured Parties and the Junior Obligations Secured Parties under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Junior Collateral Agent may take the actions contemplated by the last sentence of Section 2.02 hereof. 

^Reinstatement. In the event that any of the Senior Obligations shall be paid in full and such payment or any part thereof shall subsequently, for whatever reason (including, but not limited to, an order or judgment for disgorgement of a preference under Title 11 of the United Stated Code, or any similar law, or the settlement of any claim in respect thereof), be required to be returned or repaid, the terms and conditions of this Article II shall be fully applicable thereto until all such Senior Obligations shall again have been paid in full in cash. 

^\centered Designated Senior Obligations 

^Designation. The Company may from time to time, subject to any limitations contained in the Credit Agreement, any then existing Designated Senior Obligations Governing Documents and the Note Indenture, designate additional obligations that are, or are to be, secured by Liens on any assets or properties of the Company or any subsidiaries of the Company as Designated Senior Obligations by delivering to each Collateral Agent a notice: 

^^^describing the obligations being designated as Designated Senior Obligations, and including a statement of the maximum aggregate outstanding principal amount of such obligations; 

^^^listing the Designated Senior Obligations Governing Documents under which such Designated Senior Obligations are issued or incurred and the Designated Senior Obligations Security Documents securing such Designated Senior Obligations, and attaching copies of such Designated Senior Obligations Governing Documents and Designated Senior Obligations Security Documents; 

^^^identifying the Designated Senior Obligations Collateral Agent with respect to such Designated Senior Obligations, and any other Representative of the holders of such Designated Senior Obligations; 

^^^certifying that the incurrence of such Designated Senior Obligations, the creation of the Liens securing such Designated Senior Obligations and the designation of such Designated Senior Obligations as Designated Senior Obligations hereunder do not violate or result in a default under any provision of any Credit Agreement, any then existing Designated Senior Obligations Governing Document or the Note Indenture; 

^^^certifying that the Designated Senior Obligations Governing Document governing such Designated Senior Obligations contains provisions under which the related Designated Senior Obligations Secured Parties agree, or are deemed to agree, to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement; and 

^^^attaching a fully executed Accession Agreement under which the Designated Senior Obligations Collateral Agent with respect to such Designated Senior Obligations shall become a party to and a Collateral Agent under this Agreement (unless such Designated Senior Obligations Collateral Agent shall already be a party hereto). 

Upon the delivery of such notice and the related attachments as provided above, the obligations designated in such notice shall become Designated Senior Obligations for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Agreement, no obligation shall constitute a Designated Senior Obligation if the incurrence of such obligation, the creation of the Liens securing such obligation or the designation of such obligation as a Designated Senior Obligation hereunder would violate or result in a default under any provision of any Credit Agreement, any existing Designated Senior Obligations Governing Document or the Note Indenture. 

Each Senior Collateral Agent agrees that if it shall at any time hold a Senior Lien on any Junior Obligations Collateral that can be perfected by the possession or control of such Collateral or of any account in which such Collateral is held, and if such Collateral or any such account is in fact in the possession or under the control of such Senior Collateral Agent, such Senior Collateral Agent will serve as sub-agent for each Junior Collateral Agent for the sole purpose of perfecting the Junior Lien of such Junior Collateral Agent in such Collateral. It is agreed that the obligations of the applicable Senior Collateral Agent and the rights of the Junior Collateral Agents and the other Junior Secured Parties in connection with any such sub-agency arrangement will be in all respects subject to the provisions of Article II. The Senior Collateral Agent will be deemed to make no representation as to the adequacy of the steps taken by it to perfect the Junior Lien on any such Collateral and shall have no responsibility to any Junior Collateral Agent or other Junior Secured Party for such perfection, it being understood that the sole purpose of this Article is to enable the Junior Secured Parties to obtain a perfected Junior Lien in such Collateral to the extent, if any, that such perfection results from the possession or control of such Collateral or any such account by the Senior Collateral Agent. Upon the Discharge of Senior Obligations with respect to Senior Obligations secured by the Senior Lien of any Senior Collateral Agent, such Senior 

Collateral Agent shall take all such actions in its power as shall reasonably be requested by the Junior Collateral Agent to transfer possession or control of such Collateral or any such account to the Junior Collateral Agent; provided, that if any such Collateral or any such account shall be subject to any other Senior Lien, then such Senior Collateral Agent shall instead transfer such possession or control of such Collateral or such account to the Senior Collateral Agent holding such Senior Lien. The Junior Collateral Agent agrees that if it shall obtain possession or control of any Collateral or any account pursuant to the foregoing provisions and such Collateral or account shall thereafter become subject to any Senior Lien, it will take all such actions in its power as shall reasonably be requested by the Senior Collateral Agent holding such Senior Lien to transfer possession or control of such Collateral or such account to such Senior Collateral Agent. 

^\centered Existence and Amounts of Liens and Obligations 

Whenever any Collateral Agent shall be required, in connection with the exercise of its rights or the performance of its obligations hereunder, to determine the existence or amount of any Senior Obligations or Junior Obligations, or the existence of any Lien securing any such obligations, or the Collateral subject to any such Lien, it may request that such information be furnished to it in writing by the Representative of such Senior Obligations or Junior Obligations and shall be entitled to make such determination on the basis of the information so furnished; provided, however, that if, notwithstanding the request of such Collateral Agent, such Representative shall fail or refuse reasonably promptly to provide the requested information, such Collateral Agent shall be entitled to determine such existence or amount by such method as it may, in the exercise of its good faith judgment, determine, including by reliance upon a certificate of the Company. Each Collateral Agent may rely conclusively, and shall be fully protected in so relying, on any determination made by it in accordance with the provisions of the preceding sentence (or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction) and shall have no liability to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any Secured Party or any other person as a result of such determination. 

^\centered Consent of Grantors 

Each Grantor hereby consents to the provisions of this Agreement and the intercreditor arrangements provided for herein and agrees (a) that no Collateral Agent or other Secured Party shall have any liability to any Grantor as a result of the performance of its obligations hereunder and (b) that the obligations of the Grantors under the Senior Obligations Security Documents will in no way be diminished or otherwise affected by the provisions or arrangements provided for herein. Each Grantor also hereby confirms its respective guarantees, pledges and grants of security interests, as applicable, under each of the Credit Facilities Security Documents to which it is a party, and agrees that, notwithstanding the effectiveness of the Note Security Documents, such guarantees, pledges and grants of security interests shall continue to be in full force and effect and shall accrue to the benefit of the Credit Facilities Secured Parties.
