Compensation

Your starting base salary will be $[[USD Value 1: Number]] per annum payable in substantially equal bi-weekly installments of $[[USD Value 2: Number]].

In addition, you are eligible for a fiscal year based incentive cash bonus opportunity of up to [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of your base salary for a particular fiscal year pursuant to the terms of the Satcon 2010 Incentive Plan for Management, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

We are also offering you two stock options, one in the amount of [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of our Common Stock that will be issued under Satcon’s 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) and one that will be issued outside of the Plan in the amount of [[Shares 1]] shares of our Common Stock (individually, an “Option” and, collectively, the “Options”). Shares exercisable under the Options shall vest in accordance with the following schedule: (i) one-quarter of the shares underlying each Option shall vest on the first anniversary of your employment commencement date, and (ii) one-twelfth of the shares underlying each Option shall vest on each quarterly anniversary of your employment commencement date commencing with the fifth quarterly anniversary of your employment commencement date (250,000 in the aggregate per year). Except as set forth below, any unvested shares under the Options will expire on the last day of your employment and each Option will expire at the earlier of ten years after the date of grant, if you remain an active employee at that time, or 90 days after you are no longer employed by Satcon hereunder (unless you are terminated for “Cause” (as hereinafter defined) in which case it will expire immediately). If your employment is terminated without Cause or is Constructively Terminated (as such term is hereinafter defined) or you become subject to a Disability (as such term is defined under the Plan) or die while you are employed by the Company you or your Estate shall have 12 months after such termination without Cause,

Constructive Termination, determination of Disability or date of death to exercise the option.

If you choose not to exercise, your Options will be accorded the same treatment as options outstanding under the Plan are accorded under the Change in Control transaction. The Options will be subject to our obtaining the approval of our Board of Directors (which will be obtained prior to your commencing employment) and any necessary pre-issuance notice filing with NASDAQ with respect to the Option being issued outside of the Plan. We will file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 following your employment commencement date covering the Option being issued outside of the Plan and the shares issuable thereunder.

The exercise price of the Options will be the greater of (i) $[[USD Value 3: Number]] per share or (ii) the closing bid price of a share of Satcon Common Stock on the NASDAQ exchange on the date the option is granted, which will be the date on which your employment with Satcon commences. Satcon will prepare and provide you with a copy of the Options prior to your commencement of employment.
