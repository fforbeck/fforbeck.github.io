^^^^^ 
The Senior Notes (the *“Series 2010-A Notes”*) described above together with each Series of Additional Notes which may from time to time be issued pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2 are collectively referred to as the *“Notes”* (such term shall also include any such notes issued in substitution therefor pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement). The Tranche A Notes and the Tranche B Notes shall be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit 1(a) and Exhibit 1(b), respectively, with such changes therefrom, if any, as may be approved by the Purchasers and the Obligors. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Schedule B; references to a “Schedule” or an “Exhibit” are, unless otherwise specified, to a Schedule or an Exhibit attached to this Agreement. 

^Interest Rates. The Series 2010-A Notes shall bear interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) on the unpaid principal thereof from the date of issuance at a per annum rate equal to [[Percentage 1]]% in the case of the Tranche A Notes, and [[Percentage 2]]% in the case of the Tranche B Notes, payable semiannually on the 13th day of May and November in each year and at maturity, commencing on [[Date 4: Date]], until such principal sum shall have become due and payable, and, to the extent permitted by law on any overdue payment (including any overdue prepayment) of principal, any overdue payment of interest and any overdue payment of any Make-Whole Amount or (without duplication) Swap Indemnification Amount, payable semi-annually as aforesaid (or, at the option of the registered holder hereof, on demand), at the applicable Default Rate until paid.

^Additional Series of Notes. The Obligors may, from time to time, in their sole discretion but subject to the terms hereof, issue and sell one or more additional Series of their unsecured promissory notes under the provisions of this Agreement pursuant to a supplement (a *“Supplement”*) substantially in the form of Exhibit S, *provided* that the aggregate principal amount of Notes of all Series issued pursuant to all Supplements in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.2 shall not exceed $[[USD Value 1: Number]] (or the equivalent amount in Euros determined at the time of issuance thereof). Each additional Series of Notes (the *“Additional Notes”*) issued pursuant to a Supplement shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: 

^^^each Series of Additional Notes, when so issued, shall be differentiated from all previous Series by sequential alphabetical designation inscribed thereon; 

^^^Additional Notes of the same Series may consist of more than one different and separate tranches and may differ with respect to outstanding principal amounts, maturity dates, currencies, interest rates and premiums, if any, and price and terms of redemption or payment prior to maturity, but all such different and separate tranches of the same Series shall vote as a single class and constitute one Series; 

^^^^^ 
^^^each Series of Additional Notes shall be dated the date of issue, bear interest at such rate or rates, mature on such date or dates, be subject to such mandatory and optional prepayment on the dates and at the premiums, if any, be payable in such currency, have such additional or different conditions precedent to closing, such representations and warranties and such additional covenants as shall be specified in the Supplement under which such Additional Notes are issued and upon execution of any such Supplement, this Agreement shall be amended (a) to reflect such additional covenants without further action on the part of the holders of the Notes outstanding under this Agreement, *provided*, that any such additional covenants shall inure to the benefit of all holders of Notes so long as any Additional Notes issued pursuant to such Supplement remain outstanding, and (b) to reflect such representations and warranties as are contained in such Supplement for the benefit of the holders of such Additional Notes in accordance with the provisions of Section 16; 

^^^each Series of Additional Notes issued under this Agreement shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit 1 to Exhibit S hereto with such variations, omissions and insertions as are necessary or permitted hereunder; 

^^^the minimum principal amount of any Note issued under a Supplement shall be $[[USD Value 2: Number]] (or the equivalent amount in Euros), except as may be necessary to evidence the outstanding amount of any Note originally issued in a denomination of $[[USD Value 2]] (or the equivalent amount in Euros) or more; 

^^^the Additional Notes may only be issued in Dollars and/or Euros; 

^^^all Additional Notes shall constitute Senior Debt of the Obligors and shall rank *pari passu* with all other outstanding Notes; and 

^^^no Additional Notes shall be issued hereunder if, at the time of issuance thereof and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds thereof, any Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. 

^Subsidiary Guaranty. (a) The payment by the Obligors of all amounts due with respect to the Notes and the performance by the Obligors of their obligations under this Agreement will be absolutely and unconditionally guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors pursuant to the Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement, dated as of even date herewith, which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.3 attached hereto, and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.6 hereof (the *“Subsidiary Guaranty”*). 

^^^^^ 
^^The holders of the Notes agree to discharge and release any Subsidiary Guarantor from the Subsidiary Guaranty upon the written request of the Obligors, *provided* that (i) such Subsidiary Guarantor has been released and discharged (or will be released and discharged concurrently with the release of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Subsidiary Guaranty) as an obligor and guarantor under and in respect of all outstanding Senior Debt (including the Senior Credit Agreement) and the Obligors so certify to the holders of the Notes in a certificate of a Responsible Officer, (ii) at the time of such release and discharge, the Obligors shall deliver a certificate of a Responsible Officer to the holders of the Notes stating that no Default or Event of Default exists, and (iii) if any fee or other form of consideration is given to any holder of Debt of the Obligors in connection with such release, holders of the Notes shall receive equivalent consideration (a *“Collateral Release”*). In addition, upon the written request of the Obligors, any Subsidiary Guarantor may be discharged and released from the Subsidiary Guaranty upon the prior written consent of the Required Holders, which written consent may be given or withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of the Required Holders. 

^Closing.  
The sale and purchase of the Series 2010-A Notes to be purchased by each Purchaser shall occur at the offices of Chapman and Cutler LLP, [[Address 2: Address]] at 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, at a closing (the *“Closing Date”*) on [[Date 3]] or on such other Business Day thereafter on or prior to [[Date 5: Date]] as may be agreed upon by the Obligors and the Purchasers. On the Closing Date, the Obligors will deliver to each Purchaser the Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser in the form of a single Note (or such greater number of Notes in denominations of at least $[[USD Value 2]] (or the equivalent amount in Euros) as such Purchaser may request) dated the date of the Closing Date and registered in such Purchaser’s name (or in the name of such Purchaser’s nominee), against delivery by such Purchaser to the Obligors or their order of immediately available funds in the amount of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of immediately available funds for the account of the Obligors [Confidential Information Redacted]. If, on the Closing Date, the Obligors shall fail to tender such Notes to any Purchaser as provided above in this Section 3, or any of the conditions specified in Section 4 shall not have been fulfilled to any Purchaser’s satisfaction, such Purchaser shall, at such Purchaser’s election, be relieved of all further obligations under this Agreement, without thereby waiving any rights such Purchaser may have by reason of such failure or such nonfulfillment.

^^*Execution and Delivery of Guaranty Ratification.* Provided a Collateral Release shall not have occurred, each Subsidiary Guarantor shall execute and deliver a Guaranty Ratification in the form attached to the Subsidiary Guaranty. 

^Representations and Warranties of the Obligors. 

Each Obligor represents and warrants to each Purchaser that: 

^Organization; Power and Authority. Each Obligor is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing in good standing (or equivalent status) under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good standing (or equivalent status) in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing (or equivalent status) could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Obligor has the corporate power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact the business it transacts, to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Series 2010-A Notes and to perform the provisions hereof and thereof. 

^Authorization, Etc. This Agreement and the Series 2010-A Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each Obligor, and this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and delivery thereof each Series 2010-A Note will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Obligor enforceable against each Obligor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 

^^^^^ 
^Disclosure. The Obligors, through their agent, Banc of America Securities LLC, have delivered to each Purchaser a copy of a Private Placement Memorandum, dated [[Date 6: Date]] (the *“Memorandum”*), relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Memorandum fairly describes, in all material respects, the general nature of the business and principal properties of the Obligors and the Subsidiaries. This Agreement, the Memorandum, the documents, certificates or other writings delivered to the Purchasers by or on behalf of the Obligors in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5, taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made. Except as disclosed in the Memorandum or in one of the documents, certificates or other writings identified therein or herein, since [[Date 7: Date]], there has been no change in the financial condition, operations, business or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except changes that individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no fact known to the Obligors that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been set forth herein or in the Memorandum or in the other documents, certificates and other writings delivered to each Purchaser by or on behalf of the Obligors specifically for use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 

^Organization and Ownership of Shares of Subsidiaries; Affiliates.

^^if such Obligor is not the Successor Corporation, such Successor Corporation shall have executed and delivered to each holder of Notes its assumption of the due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition of this Agreement (and each Supplement thereto) and the Notes (pursuant to such agreements and instruments as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders), and the Successor Corporation shall have caused to be delivered to each holder of Notes (A) an opinion of nationally recognized independent counsel, to the effect that all agreements or instruments effecting such assumption are enforceable in accordance with their terms and (B) an acknowledgment from each Subsidiary Guarantor that the Subsidiary Guaranty continues in full force and effect; and 

^^immediately after giving effect to such transaction no Default or Event of Default would exist.

^Remedies on Default, Etc.  
^Acceleration. (a) If an Event of Default with respect to the Obligors described in paragraph (h) or (i) of Section 11 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (i) of paragraph (h) or described in clause (vi) of paragraph (h) by virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses clause (i) of paragraph (h)) has occurred, all the Notes of every Series then outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and payable. 

^^If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Required Holders may at any time at their option, by notice or notices to the Obligors, declare all the Notes of every Series then outstanding to be immediately due and payable. 

^^^^^ 
^^If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 11 has occurred and is continuing with respect to any Notes, any holder or holders of Notes at the time outstanding affected by such Event of Default may at any time, at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Obligors, declare all the Notes held by such holder or holders to be immediately due and payable. 

Upon any Note’s becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1, whether automatically or by declaration, such Note will forthwith mature and the entire unpaid principal amount of such Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and the Make-Whole Amount or other premium determined in respect of such principal amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), plus any Swap Indemnification Amount in respect of a Swapped Note shall all be immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. Each Obligor acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Obligors (except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment of a Make-Whole Amount or other premium by the Obligors in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances. 

^Other Remedies. If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the time outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise. 

^Rescission. At any time after the Notes have been declared due and payable pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of Section 12.1, the Required Holders, by written notice to the Obligors, may rescind and annul any such declaration and its consequences if (a) the Obligors have paid all overdue interest on the Notes, all principal of and Make-Whole Amount or premium, if any, on any Notes that are due and payable and are unpaid other than by reason of such declaration, and all interest on such overdue principal and Make-Whole Amount or premium, if any, and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes, at the Default Rate, (b) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason of such declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (c) no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies due pursuant hereto or to any Notes. No rescission and annulment under this Section 12.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right consequent thereon. 

^No Waivers or Election of Remedies, Expenses, Etc. No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note in exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such holder’s rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or now or 

^^^^^ 
hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. Without limiting the obligations of the Obligors under Section 15, the Obligors will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover all costs and expenses of such holder incurred in any enforcement or collection under this Section 12, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses and disbursements. 

^Registration; Exchange; Substitution of Notes. 

^Registration of Notes. The Company shall keep at its principal executive office a register for the registration and registration of transfers of Notes. The name and address of each holder of one or more Notes, each transfer thereof and the name and address of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be registered in such register. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in whose name any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Obligors shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Obligors shall give to any holder of a Note that is an Institutional Investor promptly upon request therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and addresses of all registered holders of Notes. 

^Transfer and Exchange of Notes. Upon surrender of any Note at the principal executive office of the Company for registration of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender for registration of transfer, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or its attorney duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the address for notices of each transferee of such Note or part thereof), the Obligors shall execute and deliver not more than five (5) Business Days following surrender of such Note, at the Obligors’ expense (except as provided below), one or more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof) of the same Series (and of the same tranche if such Series has separate tranches) in exchange therefor, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall be substantially in the form of the Note of such Series originally issued hereunder or pursuant to any Supplement. Each such new Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon. The Obligors may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in denominations of less than $[[USD Value 2]] (or the equivalent amount in Euros), *provided* that if necessary to enable the registration of transfer by a holder of its entire holding of Notes of a Series (or of a tranche, if such Series has separate tranches), one Note of such Series or tranche, as applicable, may be in a denomination of less than $[[USD Value 2]] (or the equivalent amount in Euros). Any transferee, by its acceptance of a Note registered in its name (or the name of its nominee), shall be deemed to have made the representation set forth in Section 6, *provided* that such holder may (in reliance upon information provided by the Obligors, which shall not be unreasonably withheld) make a representation to the effect that the purchase by such holder of any Note will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406(a) of ERISA. 

^^^^^ 
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or under the securities laws of any state and may not be transferred or resold unless registered under the Securities Act and all applicable state securities laws or unless an exemption from the requirement for such registration is available. 

^Replacement of Notes. Upon receipt by the Obligors of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note (which evidence shall be, in the case of an Institutional Investor, notice from such Institutional Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation), and 

^^in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to them (*provided* that if the holder of such Note is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser or another holder of a Note with a minimum net worth of at least $[[USD Value 8: Number]] such Person’s own unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or 

^^in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation thereof, 

the Obligors at their own expense shall execute and deliver not more than five (5) Business Days following satisfaction of such conditions, in lieu thereof, a new Note of the same Series (and of the same tranche if such Series has separate tranches), dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon. 

^Payments on Notes.  
^Place of Payment. Subject to Section 14.2, payments of principal, Make-Whole Amount, interest and any Swap Indemnification Amount in respect of the Swapped Notes becoming due and payable on the Notes shall be made in New York, New York at the principal office of Bank of America, N.A. in such jurisdiction. The Obligors may at any time, by notice to each holder of a Note, change the place of payment of the Notes so long as such place of payment shall be either the principal office of a Obligor in such jurisdiction or the principal office of a bank or trust company in such jurisdiction. 

^Home Office Payment. So long as any Purchaser or Additional Purchaser or such Purchaser’s nominee or such Additional Purchaser’s nominee shall be the holder of any Note, and notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the contrary, the Obligors will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal, Make-Whole Amount or premium, if any, and interest and any Swap Indemnification Amount in respect of the Swapped Notes by the method and at the address specified for such purpose for such Purchaser on Schedule A hereto or, in the case of any Additional Purchaser, Schedule A attached to any Supplement pursuant to which such Additional Purchaser is a party, or by such other method or at such other address as such Purchaser or Additional Purchaser shall have from time to time specified to the Obligors in writing for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation thereon, except that upon written request of the Obligors made concurrently with or reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, such Purchaser or Additional Purchaser shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after any such request, to the Obligors at the principal executive office of 

^^^^^ 
the Company or at the place of payment most recently designated by the Obligors pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by any Purchaser or Additional Purchaser or such Person’s nominee, such Person will, at its election, either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to an Obligor in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The Obligors will afford the benefits of this Section 14.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note. 

^Expenses, Etc.  
^Transaction Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Obligors will pay all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees of one special counsel for the Purchasers or any Additional Purchasers and, if reasonably required, local or other counsel) incurred by each Purchaser and each Additional Purchaser and each other holder of a Note in connection with such transactions and in connection with any amendments, waivers or consents under or in respect of this Agreement (including any Supplement) or the Notes (whether or not such amendment, waiver or consent becomes effective), including, without limitation: (a) the costs and expenses incurred in enforcing or defending (or determining whether or how to enforce or defend) any rights under this Agreement (including any Supplement) or the Notes or in responding to any subpoena or other legal process or informal investigative demand by any Governmental Authority issued in connection with this Agreement (including any Supplement) or the Notes, or by reason of being a holder of any Note, and (b) the costs and expenses, including financial advisors’ fees, incurred in connection with the insolvency or bankruptcy of any Obligor or any Subsidiary or in connection with any work-out or restructuring of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any Supplement), by any Subsidiary Guaranty and by the Notes. In the event the Obligors default in the payment of any interest, principal or other amounts on any Swapped Notes on the date such payment is due (regardless of whether any period of grace shall be applicable thereto and regardless of whether such default shall be an Event of Default), the Obligors will pay, and will save each holder of a Swapped Note harmless from, any fees, costs, contractual damages or expenses (including without limitation, the costs of any funds used to pay amounts owing to any swap counterparty on such payment date) arising out of or in connection with any payments that may be due under any Swap Agreement entered into by such holder in connection with this Agreement and any Swapped Note. The Obligors will pay, and will save each Purchaser, each Additional Purchaser and each other holder of a Note harmless from, all claims in respect of any reasonable fees, costs or expenses if any, of brokers and finders (other than those retained by the Purchasers). 

^Survival. The obligations of the Obligors under this Section 15 will survive the payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, any Supplement or the Notes, and the termination of this Agreement or any Supplement. 

^^^^^ 
^Survival of Representations and Warranties; Entire Agreement.  

All representations and warranties contained herein or in any Supplement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, such Supplement and the Notes, the purchase or transfer by any Purchaser or any Additional Purchaser of any such Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of any Note may be relied upon by any subsequent holder of any such Note, regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any Additional Purchaser or any other holder of any such Note. All statements contained in any certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Obligors pursuant to this Agreement or any Supplement shall be deemed representations and warranties of the Obligors under this Agreement; *provided,* that the representations and warranties contained in any Supplement shall only be made for the benefit of the Additional Purchasers which are party to such Supplement and the holders of the Notes issued pursuant to such Supplement, including subsequent holders of any Note issued pursuant to such Supplement, and shall not require the consent of the holders of existing Notes. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement (including every Supplement) and the Notes embody the entire agreement and understanding between the Purchasers and the Additional Purchasers and the Obligors and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof. 

^Amendment and Waiver.  
^Requirements. (a) This Agreement (including any Supplement) and the Notes may be amended, and the observance of any term hereof or of the Notes may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of the Obligors and the Required Holders, except that (i) no amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 21 hereof or the corresponding provision of any Supplement, or any defined term (as it is used in any such Section or such corresponding provision of any Supplement), will be effective as to any holder of Notes unless consented to by such holder of Notes in writing, and (ii) no such amendment or waiver may, without the written consent of all of the holders of Notes at the time outstanding affected thereby, (A) subject to the provisions of Section 12 relating to acceleration or rescission, change the amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal of, or reduce the rate or change the time of payment or method of computation of interest or of the Make-Whole Amount or premium on, the Notes, (B) change the percentage of the principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to consent to any such amendment or waiver, or (C) amend any of Sections 8, 11(a), 11(b), 12, 17 or 20; *provided* that, with respect to the determination of a Recognized Euro Market Maker, such determination shall be made by the Required Holders of Series 2010-A Non-Swapped Notes and, if applicable, the Obligors as provided in Section 8.6(a). 

^^*Supplements.* Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Obligors may enter into any Supplement providing for the issuance of one or more Series of Additional Notes consistent with Sections 2.2 and 4.12 hereof without obtaining the consent of any holder of any other Series of Notes. 

^^^^^ 
^Solicitation of Holders of Notes. 

^^*Solicitation.* The Obligors will provide each holder of the Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof, any Supplement or of the Notes. The Obligors will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17 to each holder of outstanding Notes promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes. 

^^*Payment.* The Obligors will not directly or indirectly pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any holder of Notes as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by such holder of Notes of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof or any Supplement unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently granted, on the same terms, ratably to each holder of Notes then outstanding even if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment. 

^^*Consent in Contemplation of Transfer.* Any consent made pursuant to this Section 17 by a holder of Notes that has transferred or has agreed to transfer its Notes to an Obligor, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of an Obligor and has provided or has agreed to provide such written consent as a condition to such transfer shall be void and of no force or effect except solely as to such holder, and any amendments effected or waivers granted or to be effected or granted that would not have been or would not be so effected or granted but for such consent (and the consents of all other holders of Notes that were acquired under the same or similar conditions) shall be void and of no force or effect except solely as to such holder. 

^Binding Effect, Etc. Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 17 applies equally to all holders of Notes and is binding upon them and upon each future holder of any Note and upon the Obligors without regard to whether such Note has been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing between any Obligor and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note. As used herein, the term “this Agreement” and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented. 

^Notes Held by Obligors, Etc. Solely for the purpose of determining whether the holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this Agreement or the Notes, or have directed the taking of any action provided herein or in the Notes to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by any Obligor or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.

Each Obligor agrees and stipulates that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by such Purchaser in the regular course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. This Section 19 shall not prohibit any Obligor or any other holder of Notes from contesting any such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.

^Confidential Information.  
For the purposes of this Section 20, *“Confidential Information”* means information delivered to any Purchaser by or on behalf of the Obligors or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was clearly marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received by such Purchaser as being confidential information of the Obligors or such Subsidiary, *provided* that such term does not include information that (a) was publicly known or otherwise known to such Purchaser prior to the time of such disclosure, (b) subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission by such Purchaser or any Person acting on such Purchaser’s behalf, (c) otherwise becomes known to such Purchaser other than through disclosure by any Obligor or any Subsidiary or (d) constitutes financial statements delivered to such Purchaser under Section 7.1 that are otherwise publicly available. Each Purchaser will maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information in accordance with procedures adopted by such Purchaser in good faith to protect confidential information of third parties delivered to such Purchaser, *provided* that such Purchaser may deliver or disclose Confidential Information to (i) such Purchaser’s directors, trustees, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such disclosure reasonably relates to the administration of the investment represented by such Purchaser’s Notes), (ii) such Purchaser’s financial advisors and other professional advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 20, (iii) any other holder of any Note, (iv) any Institutional Investor to which such Purchaser sells or offers to sell such Note or any part thereof or any participation therein (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (v) any Person from which such Purchaser offers to purchase any security of any Obligor (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (vi) any federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such Purchaser, (vii) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about such Purchaser’s investment portfolio, or (viii) any other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or appropriate (w) to effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to such Purchaser, (x) in response to any subpoena or other legal process, (y) in connection with any litigation to which such Purchaser is a party or (z) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent such Purchaser may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the rights and remedies under such Purchaser’s Notes and this Agreement. Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were a party to this Agreement. On reasonable request by any Obligor in connection with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such holder will enter into an agreement with the Obligors embodying the provisions of this Section 20. 

^^^^^ 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and to the extent not otherwise prohibited by applicable securities laws, each Purchaser (and each employee, representative or other agent of each Purchaser) may disclose to any Person, without limitations of any kind, the “tax treatment” and “tax structure” (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the offering of the Notes and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to each Purchaser relating to such tax treatment or tax structure; *provided* that, with respect to any document or similar item that in either case contains information concerning such tax treatment or tax structure of the offering as well as other information, such permitted disclosure shall apply solely to such facts and relevant portions of the document or similar item that relate to such tax treatment or tax structure. 

^Substitution of Purchaser.  
Each Purchaser shall have the right to substitute any one of such Purchaser’s Affiliates as the purchaser of the Notes that such Purchaser has agreed to purchase hereunder, by written notice to any Obligor, which notice shall be signed by both such Purchaser and such Purchaser’s Affiliate, shall contain such Affiliate’s agreement to be bound by this Agreement and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 6. Upon receipt of such notice, wherever the word “Purchaser” is used in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), such word shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu of such Purchaser. In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a purchaser hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to such Purchaser all of the Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by any Obligor of notice of such transfer, wherever the word “Purchaser” is used in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), such word shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer to such Purchaser, and such Purchaser shall have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement. 

^Miscellaneous.  
^Successors and Assigns. All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement (including all covenants and other agreements contained in any Supplement) by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any subsequent holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not. 

^Payments Due on Non-Business Days. Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding (but without limiting the requirement in Section 8.4 that the notice of any optional prepayment specify a Business Day as the date fixed for such prepayment), any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount, any Swap Indemnification Amount in respect of the Swapped Note or interest on any Note that is due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day; provided that if the maturity date of any Note is a date other than a Business Day, the payment otherwise due on such maturity date shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and shall include the additional days elapsed in the computation of interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day. 

^^^^^ 
^Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 

^Construction. Each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person. 

^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto. 

^Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law of the State of New York excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such State that would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State. 

^Accounting Terms. All accounting terms used herein which are not expressly defined in this Agreement have the meanings respectively given to them in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, (i) all computations made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) all financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenants set out in this Agreement, any election by the Company to measure an item of Indebtedness using fair value (as permitted by Accounting Standards Codification 825-10-25 (previously referred to as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159) or any other Accounting Standards Codification or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) shall be disregarded and such determination shall be made by valuing indebtedness at [[Percentage 3]]% of the outstanding principal amount (except to the extent that such indebtedness was issued at a discount or premium in which case the value of such indebtedness shall be valued at the [[Percentage 3]]% of the outstanding principal amount less any unamortized discount or plus any unamortized premium, as the case may be). 

^Determinations Involving Different Currencies. In the event of any determination hereunder of the requisite percentage or the principal amount of any Notes of more than one currency, all such Notes which are issued in Euros shall, for the purposes of determining any such requisite percentage or principal amount, be deemed to have been converted into Dollars as of the end of the immediately preceding Business Day as indicated on screen FXIP of Bloomberg (or such other screen that may replace screen FXIP). 

^^^^^ 
^Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Immunity*.*  

^^For the purpose of assuring that the holders of the Notes may enforce their rights under this Agreement, each Obligor, for itself and its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably: 

^^^agrees that any legal or equitable action, suit or proceeding against an Obligor arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or the subject matter of any of the foregoing may be instituted in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; 

^^^waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any action, suit or proceeding; 

^^^irrevocably submits itself to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York for purposes of any such action, suit or proceeding; and 

^^^irrevocably waives any immunity from jurisdiction to which it might otherwise be entitled in any such action, suit or proceeding which may be instituted in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and irrevocably waives any immunity from the maintaining of an action against it to enforce any judgment for money obtained in any such action, suit or proceeding and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any immunity from execution. 

^^Each Obligor consents to process being served by or on behalf of any holder of Notes in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in Section 23(a) by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to it at its address specified in Section 18 or at such other address of which such holder shall then have been notified pursuant to said Section. Each Obligor agrees that such service upon receipt (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (ii) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it. Notices hereunder shall be conclusively presumed received as evidenced by a delivery receipt furnished by the United States Postal Service or any reputable commercial delivery service. 

^Judgment Currency.  
^Judgment Currency. Any payment on account of an amount that is payable hereunder or under the Notes by the Obligors which is made to or for the account of any holder of Notes in a currency other than the Applicable Currency (as defined below) with respect to such payment, whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any security or the liquidation of such party or any other reason whatsoever, shall constitute a discharge of the Obligors’ obligations under this Agreement and/or the Notes only to 

^^^^^ 
the extent of the amount of the Applicable Currency which such holder could purchase in the foreign exchange markets in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Business Day following receipt of the payment first referred to above with the amount of the currency in which such payment was made. If the amount of the Applicable Currency that could be so purchased is less than the amount of the Applicable Currency originally due to such holder, the Obligors agree, to the full extent permitted by law, to indemnify and save harmless such holder from and against all loss or damage arising out of or as a result of such deficiency. This indemnity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in this Agreement and/or the Notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by such holder from time to time and, shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or the Notes or under any judgment or order. *“Applicable Currency”* means, with respect to any and all payments of principal, Make-Whole Amount (other than any Make-Whole Amount and (without duplication) the Swap Indemnification Amount with respect to a Swapped Note payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) and interest becoming due and payable on any Note, the currency specified in such Note and, with respect to all other payments required to be made hereunder or under any Note, Dollars. 

^Survival. The obligations of the Obligors under this Section 24 will survive the payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, any Supplement or the Notes, and the termination of this Agreement or any Supplement.
