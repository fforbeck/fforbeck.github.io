Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the terms and conditions of the Recapitalization Agreement remain unchanged and the Hallmark Parties hereby reserve all rights and remedies available to them at law, in equity and under the Recapitalization Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

Please acknowledge that the foregoing is acceptable by executing a counterpart to this letter and returning it to the Hallmark Parties in accordance with Section 11 (Notices) of the Recapitalization Agreement.
