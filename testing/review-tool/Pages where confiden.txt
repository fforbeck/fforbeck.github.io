It is understood and agreed that Customer’s failure to keep its environment in compliance with the Designated Environment (a “**DEG Failure**”) shall not be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement or the license granted hereunder; provided, however, that to the extent that CSG’s performance under this Agreement is hindered due to such DEG Failure, such reduced level of performance shall not be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. *************** ******** ** **** ******* ** ** ********* ** *** ********* ** *** ********, *** ***** *** **** ******* ** *** ********** *********** ****** *** ******* **** *** ********** ******* ** *** *********** ** ********* *********** ** *** ******** *** ********, ******** ** ***** ***** ******* ** *********, ** ** *** ** ********* ** ******** *** ********  ***.

^**TERMINATION.** This Agreement or any one or more of the Schedules attached hereto may be terminated as follows:

^^If either party materially or repeatedly breaches any material term or condition of this Agreement, except for Customer’s obligation to pay fees, and fails either to substantially cure such breach within **** **** ******** **** after receiving written notice specifying the breach or, for those breaches which cannot reasonably be cured within ****** **** ******** ****, promptly commence curing such breach and thereafter proceed with all due diligence to substantially cure such breach within ***** **** ****** **** after receiving such written notice, then the party not in breach may, by giving written notice to the breaching party, terminate this Agreement, in its entirety or as it pertains to the particular Product or Service with respect to which the material breach occurred, in accordance with Section 19(l) below.

^^If Customer fails to pay when due any Undisputed amounts owed hereunder and which in the aggregate exceed *** ***** ******* ***,***,***.*** on or before the date that is ****** **** ****** **** after Customer has received written notice that such payment is past due, then CSG may, by giving written notice thereof to Customer in accordance with Section 19(l), terminate this Agreement or at CSG’s option, CSG may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 19(l) below as it pertains to the particular Product or Service for which such Undisputed amounts are due.

^^If Customer materially breaches any material term or condition of Section 12, entitled “License Grant” and fails to cure such breach within **** **** ****** **** following Customer’s receipt of written notice specifying the breach, then CSG may, at CSG’s option, terminate this Agreement in its entirety or as it pertains to the particular Product or Service for which Customer is in material breach, in accordance with Section 19(l) below. The foregoing sentence shall only apply, however, with respect to intentional or willful acts by Customer.

^^Reserved.

^^Upon not less than **** **** ******** ****’ prior written notice to CSG, Customer may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement and the Schedules hereto and any related statements of works and letters of authorization at any time upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (a “**Change of Control Termination**”). “**Change of Control**” means an event in which; (i) the Customer directly or indirectly, sells, disposes of or otherwise transfers all or substantially all of its assets to an unaffiliated purchaser(s) or (ii) a Controlling Interest in Customer is sold, disposed of or otherwise transferred to one or more persons that do not control Customer as of the Effective Date of the Agreement, including, but not limited to, any such sale, disposition or other transfer by way of a merger, consolidation or reorganization or similar transaction, in one or a series of transactions. “**Controlling Interest**” shall mean (i) the ownership, direct or indirect, of more than fifty percent of the voting securities or other ownership interests of a party; or (ii) the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a party, whether through the ownership of voting securities or other ownership interest, by contract, or otherwise. To compensate CSG for losses arising from a Change of Control Termination prior to the natural expiration of the term of this Agreement, Customer agrees that prior to or upon the effectiveness of any such termination, and in addition to all other amounts then due and owing to CSG for the Services and Products previously provided to Customer hereunder, Customer will pay to CSG, ** * ******** ************** *** *** *** ** * *******, ** ****** ***** ** *** ********** ****, *** ***** *** **** ********, ** **********, ** ******** ** ****** *. The parties understand and agree that this provision constitutes a critical element in the economic bargained for exchange of this Agreement and that CSG would not have entered into this Agreement without the benefits and protections hereunder.

^^In addition to the termination rights set forth in this Section 19, either party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 28, and Customer may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 29.

^^Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement or any portion thereof for any reason and the expiration or termination of any period during which CSG is required to provide Termination Assistance with respect to such termination, all rights granted to Customer under this Agreement with respect to the terminated Product or Service will cease, and Customer will promptly; (i) remove all the Affected Products from the Designated Environment and all of Customer’s other computer systems, storage media and other files; (ii) at Customer’s option either destroy or return to CSG the Affected Products and all copies thereof; (iii) deliver to CSG an affidavit which certifies that Customer has complied with these termination obligations; and (iv) pay to CSG all Undisputed fees that are due pursuant to the terminated portion of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the fees otherwise due and payable by Customer (including the Guaranteed Fees and Print and Mail Minimums, each as applicable), as set forth in Schedule F. For purposes of this subsection, “**Affected Products**” shall mean those Products which as a result of termination of Products or Services as provided in this Section 19, Customer is no longer provided a license.

CSG SmartLink® BOS. CSG SmartLink BOS is an upstream XML interface that enables Customer to integrate its applications to ACP. The interface utilizes business logic technology to route transactions, make business decisions based on input and response data, and helps to expedite requests and responses. Message based XML is used for communicating upstream from Customer’s application to ACP. The data communications method for the CSG SmartLink BOS interface is TCP/IP. Customer can use either CSG’s External Integration Protocol (EIP) or HTTP to organize request and reply records on the TCP/IP data stream. CSG provides Customer with the CSG SmartLink BOS Interface Developers Guide and the XML schemas for the business functions supported by the interface. XML requests sent by Customer must use the schemas as supplied by CSG and validate successfully against those schemas. 

^^Upon commencement of Customer’s migration to ACP, CSG shall provide to Customer SmartLink® BOS capacity of up to *** ******* ***** ************ *** ****** (“Base Transaction Volume”) at no additional cost to Customer as a replacement for current Cycle E SmartLink volumes. However, if Customer exceeds or is projected to exceed an amount greater than ****** ******* ***** of the Transaction Volume whichever is greater (“Excess Transaction Volume”) in a ****** **** *** ****, then CSG shall use reasonable efforts to provide Customer with prior written notice, which may be provided via e-mail, stating the amount of the Excess Transaction Volume and any estimated costs to be incurred to support such Excess Transaction Volume. Upon provision of the foregoing notice, CSG and Customer shall execute a Statement of Work and necessary amendments which shall include, but not be limited to, commercially reasonable amounts for hardware, software, related maintenance, and resources necessary for operating, maintaining, developing, supporting and testing the environment and the amount of additional SmartLink® BOS capacity, presented as transactions per second, Customer is purchasing. Transaction Volume shall mean the Base Transaction Volume plus any additional transactions per second provided pursuant to any subsequently executed Statements of Work.

Customer agrees to notify CSG by the *** ***** ******** *** of each calendar month in writing of its estimated Transaction Volume whichever is greater for the subsequent ****** **** ****** **** in order for CSG to support any material increase in Transaction Volume.
