**THIRD:** The Borrower and the Buyer desire that the Property be conveyed from the Borrower to the Buyer and have requested that the Bank consent to such transfer. The Bank has agreed to the request, subject, however, to certain terms and conditions. 

**NOW, THEREFORE,** for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Borrower, the Buyer and the Bank agree as follows: 

^Mortgage Assumption**.** The Bank hereby consents to the sale, transfer, and conveyance of the Property by the Borrower to the Buyer, ***provided, however,*** that the Buyer hereby agrees to assume all obligations of the Borrower under the Mortgage, which obligations the Buyer hereby affirms and assumes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower, the Buyer and the Bank agree that the Buyer is expressly not assuming personal liability to the Bank to repay the Note.  

^Status of the Loan. As of the Effective Date, the Bank represents to the Buyer in good faith that: (a) Exhibit B sets forth a list of all material documents, instruments and agreements related to the Loan; and (b) after giving effect to amendments dated the date hereof, the Bank has no actual knowledge of any Event of Default under the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage; provided, however, that Bank shall bear no liability of any kind with respect to such representations and that such representations do not constitute a waiver of any provision or term of the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage any related document. 

^Direct Communication and Payment. The Bank and the Borrower authorize and consent to the Bank communicating directly with the Buyer, and the Buyer communicating directly with the Bank, with respect to any matters related to the Loan or the Property that otherwise would be handled exclusively between the Bank and the Borrower. The Buyer may make (and the Bank will accept) payments related to the Loan otherwise required to be made by the Borrower. 

^Copies of Notices. Any notices required to be given by the Bank to the Buyer under the Mortgage will be sent to the Buyer at the address set forth under the Buyer’s signature below or such other address as the Buyer may designate by written notice to the Bank from time to time (the “Buyer’s Notice Address”) with a copy substantially contemporaneously to the Borrower. Any notices required to be given by the Bank to the Borrower under the Note, the Loan Agreement and/or any Related Agreement will be sent to the Borrower as provided in the applicable loan document with a copy substantially contemporaneously to the Buyer at the Buyer’s Notice Address. 

^Supplemental Buyer Cure Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Mortgage, a default defined as an Event of Default under subsection (h) of the Mortgage, other than a default defined herein as an “Immediate Default,” shall not be considered an Event of Default under the Mortgage until twenty (20) days following the occurrence of such default and notice to Buyer, and the failure to cure such default or to cause such default to be cured within such period of time. The cure periods hereunder are not intended to extend any cure or grace period otherwise applicable under the Note or any Related Agreement, and all such cure or grace periods shall run concurrently without duplication. “Immediate Default” shall mean an event of default due to (i) voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of Borrower or any Related Party; (ii) the failure of Borrower or any Related Party to diligently contest and obtain the prompt dismissal of any involuntary bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding filed against such Borrower or Related Party; (iii) appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or liquidator of a substantial part of the assets of Borrower or any Related Party, (iv) service of a writ of garnishment, levy or other seizure with respect to any collateral securing the Note, or any accounts of Borrower or any Related Party, (v) failure to maintain insurance coverage for collateral, if any, as may be required; (vi) submission to Lender of any required financial statement or certificate of Borrower or any Related Party that is incorrect, false or misleading in any material respect when furnished or made, or (vii) breach of any covenant or obligation of Borrower or any Related Party that is not reasonably curable within twenty (20) days of such breach. “Related Agreement” shall mean each loan agreement, guaranty, security agreement, mortgage or other loan document relating to or securing the Note. “Related Party” shall mean each guarantor, co-borrower, mortgagor or other party executing a Related Agreement.” 

^Other Buyer Covenants. 

^^The Buyer shall establish a replacement reserve account with the Bank by entering into Replacement Reserve Agreement with the Bank in form acceptable to the Bank (as the same may be amended, restated or replaced from time to time, the “Replacement Reserve Agreement”) and will observe and perform all covenants and agreements in the Replacement Reserve Agreement. 

^^The Buyer shall maintain its principal deposit account with the Bank. 

^^Not later than 60 days after, and as of the end of, each calendar year, the Buyer shall provide to Bank a rent roll in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Bank. 

^^The Buyer shall cause the Property to maintain an occupancy rate (with bona fide tenants at market rates) of no less than [[Percentage 1: Number]]% as of the end of each year beginning [[Date 7: Date]]. 

^^The Buyer shall either: (i) cause the Property to maintain an occupancy rate (with bona fide tenants at market rates) of no less than [[Percentage 2: Number]]% as of the end of each year beginning [[Date 7]], or (ii) pay and maintain (for so long as such occupancy rate is less than [[Percentage 2]]%) the Occupancy Funds. The “Occupancy Funds” mean TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]) to be held by the Bank as provided herein as additional collateral security for the Indebtedness (as defined in the Mortgage). No earnings or interest shall be payable to Buyer on the Occupancy Funds. The Funds shall not be, nor be deemed to be, trust funds, and Bank shall have the right to hold the Occupancy Funds in any manner Bank elects and may commingle the Occupancy Funds with other moneys held by Bank. If the amount of the Occupancy Funds held by Bank shall not be sufficient at any time to satisfy this subsection, Buyer shall pay to Bank any amount necessary to make up the deficiency upon notice from Bank to Buyer requesting payment. Upon an Event of Default, as defined in the Mortgage, Bank may apply on the Indebtedness, in the order of application as Bank may determine, any Occupancy Funds then in Bank’s possession. Upon payment in full of the Indebtedness, Bank shall promptly remit to Buyer any Occupancy Funds held by Bank.
