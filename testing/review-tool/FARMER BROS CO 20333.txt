All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the Loan Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein. 

Borrowers and Guarantors have requested that Lender waive an Event of Default, and Lender is willing to agree to such waiver, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. 

Accordingly, Borrowers, Guarantors and Lender hereby agree as follows: 

^Waiver of Event of Default. Subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions precedent set forth herein, Lender hereby waives any Event of Default under Section 10.1(a)(iii) of the Loan Agreement arising as a result of the failure of Borrowers and Guarantors to comply with the provisions of Section 9.18 of the Loan Agreement for the periods ending [[Date 2: Date]] and [[Date 3: Date]] (the “Specified Event of Default”). 

^Effect of Waivers. Lender has not waived and is not by this agreement waiving, and has no present intention of waiving, any other Event of Default, which may have occurred prior to the date hereof, or may be continuing on the date hereof or any Event of Default which may occur after the date hereof, other than the Specified Event of Default, whether the same or similar to the Specified Event of Default or otherwise. Lender reserves the right, in its discretion, to exercise any or all of its or its rights and remedies arising under the Financing Agreements, applicable law or otherwise, as a result of any other Event of Default which may have occurred prior to the date hereof, or is continuing on the date hereof, or any Event of Default which may occur after the date hereof, whether the same or similar to the Specified Event of Default. 

^Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Borrowers and Guarantors represent, warrant and covenant with and to Lender as follows, which representations, warranties and covenants are continuing and shall survive the execution and delivery hereof, the truth and accuracy of, or compliance with each, together with the representations, warranties and covenants in the Loan Agreement and the other Financing Agreements, being a continuing condition of the making or providing of any Loans by Lender to Borrowers: 

^^this letter agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Borrowers and Guarantors and the agreements and obligations of Borrowers and Guarantors contained herein constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Borrowers and Guarantors enforceable against Borrowers and Guarantors in accordance with their respective terms; and 

^^after giving effect to the waiver of the Specified Event of Default, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, including without limitation any default in the payment of principal, interest or fees under the Financing Agreements. 

^Conditions Precedent. The waiver contained herein shall only be effective upon the satisfaction of each of the following conditions precedent in a manner satisfactory to Lender: 

^^Lender shall have received executed original counterparts of this letter agreement, duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Borrowers and Guarantors; and 

^^after giving effect to the waiver of the Specified Event of Default, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, including without limitation any default in the payment of principal, interest or fees under the Financing Agreements. 

^Binding Effect. This letter agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

^Counterparts. This letter agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this letter agreement by telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission s shall have the same force and effect as the delivery of an original executed counterpart of this letter agreement. Any party delivering an executed counterpart of this letter agreement by telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission shall also deliver an original executed counterpart of this letter agreement, but the failure to do so shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of this letter agreement.
