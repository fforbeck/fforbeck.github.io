[* * *] 

After Patheon has produced a minimum of [* * *] successful commercial production batches of Product and has produced commercial production batches for at least [* * *] at the Manufacturing Site (collectively, the “**Target Yield Determination Batches**”), the parties will mutually agree on the target yield for each batch in tablets for the Product at the Manufacturing Site (each, a “**Target Yield**”). 

2.2.2 **Shortfall Calculation**. Patheon will use [* * *] to maintain AAY levels for each Product above the applicable Target Yield. If the Actual Annual Yield falls more than [* * *]% percent for [* * *] than [* * *] batches, [* * *]% for [* * *] to [* * *] batches, or [* * *]% for [* * *] than [* * *] batches below the respective Target Yield in a Year, then the shortfall for the Year (the “**Shortfall**”) will be calculated as follows: 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

[***] 

2.2.3 **Credit for Shortfall**. If there is a Shortfall for a Product in a Year, then Patheon will credit Client’s account for the amount of the Shortfall not later than [* * *] after the end of the Year. Each credit under this Section 2.2(c) will be summarized on the reconciliation report form set forth in Schedule I and will be made in accordance with Section 5.5. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, any remaining credit owing under this Section 2.2 will be paid to Client. The Annual Shortfall, if any, will be disclosed by Patheon on the reconciliation report form. 

2.2.4 **Casualty Losses**. Patheon shall notify Client in writing in the event that an amount of greater than or equal to [* * *] of naltrexone HCL and/or greater than or equal to [* * *] of bupropion is damaged, lost or otherwise rendered unusable at any one time as soon as practicable following such incident. In addition, and notwithstanding any provision in this Section 2.2 to the contrary, Patheon shall reimburse Client for any Active Materials at the Active Materials Credit Value that is lost outside the normal course of manufacturing Product by fire, flood, storms or other natural disaster involving Patheon’s Manufacturing Site (a “**Casualty Loss**”) within [* * *] of Patheon’s settlement of the Casualty Loss with its insurance carriers. Patheon’s liability for a Casualty Loss will not exceed $[* * *]. For purposes of calculating the AAY above, all Active Materials reimbursed to Client as a Casualty Loss shall be removed from the Quantity Received and Quantity Dispensed totals. 

2.2.5 **Maximum Credit**. Excluding liability for Casualty Losses, Patheon’s liability for Active Materials calculated in accordance with this Section 2.2 for any Product [* * *] will not [* * *], [* * *], the [* * *] set forth in Schedule C. 

2.2.6 **No Material Breach**. It will not be a material breach of this Agreement by Patheon under Section 8.2(a) if the Actual Annual Yield is less than the Target Yield (the “**Shortfall**”).

\centered **CONVERSION FEES AND COMPONENT COSTS** 

^^**First Year Pricing.**

The tiered Price for the Products for the first Year is listed in Schedule B and is subject to the adjustments set forth in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. Schedule B sets forth a list of cost items that are included in the Price for Products; all cost items that are not included in this list are excluded from the Price and are subject to additional fees to be paid by the Client, subject to Client’s written approval prior to such additional fees being incurred. 

^^**Price Adjustments  Subsequent Years’ Pricing.**

After the [***] of the Agreement, Patheon may adjust the Price effective [[Date 4: Date]] of each Year as follows: 

^^Manufacturing Costs. Patheon may adjust the Price for [* * *], based upon the [* * *], unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. On or about [* * *] of each Year, Patheon will give Client a statement setting forth the calculation for the [* * *] adjustment to be applied in calculating the Price for the next Year. 

^^Component Costs. If Patheon incurs an increase in Component costs during the Year, it may increase the Price for the next Year to pass through the additional Component costs; provided, however, that in the event any proposed increase in the cost of a Component exceeds [* * *]% of the cost for that Component upon which the most recent fee quote was based, Patheon will use [* * *] to locate an equivalent alternative lower cost supplier for the applicable Component. If Patheon incurs a decrease in Component costs during the Year, it will decrease the Price for the next Year to pass through the additional Component cost savings. On or about [* * *] of each Year, Patheon will give Client information about the increase or decrease in Component costs which will be applied to the calculation of the Price for the next Year to reasonably demonstrate that, in the case of any increases, the Price increase is justified. But Patheon will not be required to give information to Client that is subject to obligations of confidentiality between Patheon and its suppliers. 

^^Pricing Basis. Client acknowledges that the Price in any Year is quoted based upon the Manufacturing, Packaging and Testing Assumptions for the price tiers specified in Schedule B. The Price is subject to change if [* * *]. For greater certainty, [* * *]. But Patheon will not be required to give information to Client that is subject to obligations of confidentiality between Patheon and its suppliers. 

^^Cost Improvement Program. Patheon and Client agree to work together to develop cost reduction initiatives as part of an overall cost improvement program, provided such program does not involve additional capital or extraordinary costs unless otherwise agreed to by parties in writing. All net cost savings (net of implementation costs) realized from the cost improvement program will be shared equally among the parties, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing. A “cost reduction initiative” for the purpose of this Agreement will be an initiative that reduces the internal or out-of-pocket costs incurred by a party in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. It is further agreed by the parties that on-going method improvements developed or adopted by either Client or Patheon independently of the other party(ies), will not be a cost reduction initiative under this section, and there will be no obligation on such party to share the net cost savings realized from such improvement with the other party(ies) to this Agreement. 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

For all Price adjustments under this Section 4.2, Patheon will deliver to Client on or about [***] of each Year a revised Schedule B to be effective for the next Year. 

^^**Price Adjustments  Current Year Pricing.**

During any Year of this Agreement, the Prices set out in Schedule B will be adjusted as follows: 

Extraordinary Increases in Component Costs. If, at any time, market conditions result in Patheon’s cost of Components being materially greater than normal forecasted increases, then Patheon will be entitled to an adjustment to the Price for any affected Product to compensate it for the increased Component costs. Changes materially greater than normal forecasted increases will have occurred if: (i) the cost of a Component increases by [* * *]% of the cost for that Component upon which the most recent fee quote was based; or (ii) the aggregate cost for all Components required to manufacture a Product increases by [* * *]% of the total Component costs for the Product upon which the most recent fee quote was based. If Component costs have been previously adjusted to reflect an increase in the cost of one or more Components, the adjustments set out in (i) and (ii) above will operate based on the last cost adjustment for the Components. 

For a Price adjustment under this Section 4.3, Patheon will deliver to Client a revised Schedule B and budgetary pricing information, adjusted Component costs or other documents reasonably sufficient to demonstrate that a Price adjustment is justified. Patheon will have no obligation to deliver any supporting documents that are subject to obligations of confidentiality between Patheon and its suppliers. The revised Price will be effective for any Product delivered on or after the [* * *] following Client’s receipt of the revised Schedule B. 

^^**Adjustments Due to Technical Changes.**

Amendments to the Specifications or the Quality Agreement requested by Client will only be implemented following a technical and cost review by Patheon and are subject to Client and Patheon reaching agreement on Price changes required because of the amendment. Amendments to the Specifications, the Quality Agreement, or the Manufacturing Site requested by Patheon will only be implemented following [* * *]. If Client [* * *]. In addition, [* * *]. Patheon will use [* * *] to cancel any open purchase orders for Components no longer required under any revised Specifications that were placed by Patheon with suppliers in order to fill Firm Orders or under Section 5.2, and if the orders may not be cancelled without penalty, will be assigned to and satisfied by Client. 

^^**Books and Records.**

Patheon will maintain complete and accurate books, records and accounts in connection with its manufacture and supply of Products to permit verification of payments made and obligations owed hereunder. Patheon will retain such books, records and account for a period of not less than [* * *] after the calendar year in which they are prepared, or for such longer period as may be required by Applicable Law. 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

^^**Audit.**

Client will have the right to have an independent third party accounting firm access the books and records of Patheon [* * *]. Such audit will be conducted upon at least [* * *] advanced written notice to Patheon on a date reasonably acceptable to both parties and will be attended by a representative of Patheon. Such audit will be conducted during Patheon’s normal business hours, and will not be more frequent than [* * *] (unless a material inaccuracy was found in a prior audit). The auditor will be required to sign a confidentiality agreement for the benefit of, and in a form reasonably acceptable to, Patheon. Any undisputed amounts that are determined to be due and owing by one party to the other party following such audit will be paid within [* * *] thereafter. Client will bear the cost of such audit unless such audit discloses an undisputed overpayment by Client arising out of the amounts incorrectly invoiced by Patheon during the audited period of more than [* * *]% of the amount due, in which event, Patheon will be liable for the cost of the audit and will reimburse Client for any overcharged amounts. 

\centered **ORDERS, SHIPMENT, INVOICING, PAYMENT** 

^^**Orders and Forecasts.**

^^Rolling 12 Month Forecast. [* * *] following the Effective Date, Client will give Patheon a non-binding 12 month forecast of the volume of Product that Client expects to order for commercial purposes in the first 12 months of commercial manufacture of the Product. This forecast will then be updated by Client on or before the [* * *] thereafter on a rolling forward basis. Client will update the forecast forthwith if it determines that the volumes estimated in the most recent forecast have changed by more than [* * *]%. The most recent 12**-**month forecast will prevail over all previous forecasts. 

^^Firm Orders. On a rolling basis during the term of this Agreement, [* * *] months prior to the due date for the product on the Firm Order, the Client will issue a firm written order in the form of a purchase order or otherwise (“**Firm Order**”) to purchase and, when accepted by Patheon, for Patheon to manufacture and deliver the agreed quantity of the Products on a date specified in the Firm Order. Firm Orders submitted to Patheon will specify Client’s Manufacturing Services purchase order number, quantities by Product type, monthly delivery schedule, and any other elements necessary to ensure the timely manufacture and shipment of the Products. The quantities of Products ordered in those written orders will be firm and binding on Client. Firm Orders submitted by Client pursuant to this Section 5.1(b) must be accepted by Patheon via a written order acknowledgement within six Business days of receipt of said Firm Order, and will be automatically firm and binding on Patheon up to quantities not more than [* * *]% of the amount for the delivery period specified in the Firm Order. Firm Orders not rejected by Patheon within [* * *] Business Days of receipt by Patheon will be deemed to have been accepted by Patheon. 

^^Three Year Forecast. On or before the [***] day of [* * *] of each Year Client will provide Patheon with a written non-binding three-year forecast, broken down by quarters for the second and third years of the forecast, of the volume of each Product Client then anticipates will be required to be manufactured and delivered to Client during the three-year period. Except as provided in Section 5.1(b) and (c), such three-year forecast shall be non-binding and used by Patheon for planning purposes only. Subsequently, on or before the [* * *] day of [* * *] of each Year Patheon will provide Client with a [* * *] year capacity forecast by plant and quantity for the Products entitled within this Agreement for collective review by Patheon and Client. 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

^^**Delays**. During any period during this Agreement in which Patheon, for any reason, fails to deliver the requisite quantities of Products included within any Firm Order (including but not limited to any Tablet Products which are subject to the Exclusivity Obligation), within [* * *] after the scheduled date of delivery, or if Patheon otherwise anticipates or notifies Client that it will be unable to make delivery of all or a portion of the ordered Products within [* * *] after the scheduled date of delivery, thus known as a “**Late Delivery**”, then Client may cancel the late shipment of Products from Patheon if manufacture of the Products has not started and purchase the Products ordered under the Firm Order from an alternative third party supplier. The quantity of Products purchased from the substitute supplier due to Patheon’s failure to supply shall be treated as if it were purchased from Patheon for purposes of determining the Annual Volume for subsequent purchases of Products. If Patheon is able to demonstrate to Client’s reasonably satisfaction that it has regained its ability to resume supplying hereunder, Client’s right to purchase Tablet Products from the substitute supplier shall terminate immediately upon the delivery by Patheon to Client of written notice thereof except in respect of orders already placed or obligated to be placed by Client from the substitute supplier. 

^^Patheon and the Client understand that there may be uncertainties and necessary adjustments in production schedules during the [* * *], known as the **“Initial Manufacturing Period**”. The parties agree that they will work together closely to expedite deliveries and manage the scheduling of the initial Product launch. 

^^If, after the Initial Manufacturing Period, there is a Late Delivery, Client will receive a credit from Patheon for the Late Delivery that will be applied against the purchase price under the next Firm Order. The credit will be [* * *]% of the Price of the quantities of Product not delivered by Patheon under the Firm Order on the Delivery Date (i.e., [* * *]). 

^^A Late Delivery will not be a material breach of this Agreement by Patheon for the purposes of Section 8.2. 

^^A Late Delivery will not include any delay in shipment of Product caused by events outside of Patheon’s reasonable control, such as a Force Majeure Event, a delay in delivery of API or Materials, a delay in Product release approval from Client or receipt of non-conforming API supplied by Client. 

^^**Reliance by Patheon.**

^^Client understands and acknowledges that Patheon will rely on the most recent rolling forecast and on Firm Orders in ordering the Components required to meet the Firm Orders. In addition, Client understands that to ensure an orderly supply of the Components, Patheon may want to purchase the Components in sufficient volumes to meet the production requirements for Products during part or all of the forecasted periods referred to in Section 5.1(a) or to meet the production requirements of any longer period agreed to by Patheon and Client. Accordingly, Client authorizes Patheon to purchase Components to satisfy the Manufacturing Services requirements for Products for the first [***] contemplated in the most recent forecast given by Client under Section 5.1(a). Patheon may make other purchases of Components to meet Manufacturing Services requirements for longer periods if agreed to in writing by the parties. The Client will give Patheon written authorization to order Components for any launch quantities of Product requested by Client which will be considered a Firm Order when accepted by Patheon. If Components ordered by Patheon under Firm Orders or this Section 5.3 are not included in finished Products manufactured for Client within [* * *] after the forecasted month for which the purchases have been made (or for a longer period as the parties may agree) or if the Components have expired during the period, then Client will pay to Patheon its documented, direct out-of-pocket costs therefore (including all costs incurred by Patheon for the purchase and handling of the Components, such handling costs not to exceed [* * *]%); provided, however, that (i) the Client will have the option but not the obligation to take title to and possession of all or any portion of such Components by written notice to Patheon, in which case Patheon will cooperate with the Client in the surrender, delivery and transfer of such Components as promptly as is commercially reasonable, with any shipping and related expenses to be borne by the Client, or (ii) if these Components are used in Products subsequently manufactured for Client or in third party products manufactured by Patheon, Client will receive credit for any costs of those Components previously paid to Patheon by Client and/or such third parties. 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

^^If Client fails to take possession or arrange for the destruction of Components within [* * *] of purchase or, in the case of finished Product, within [* * *] of manufacture, upon written notice to Client by Patheon of such impending charges, Client will pay Patheon $[* * *] per pallet, per [* * *] thereafter for storing the Components or finished Product. Storage fees for Components or Product which contain controlled substances or require refrigeration will be charged at $[* * *] per pallet per [* * *]. Storage fees are subject to a [* * *] pallet minimum charge per [* * *]. Patheon may ship finished Product held by it longer than [* * *] months to the Client at [* * *] on [* * *] days written notice to the Client. 

^^**Minimum Orders.**

Client may only order Manufacturing Services for batches of Products in multiples of the validated batch size set out in Schedule B. 

^^**Shipments.**

Shipments of Products will be made EXW (INCOTERMS 2000) Patheon’s shipping point unless otherwise mutually agreed. Risk of loss or of damage to Products will remain with Patheon until Patheon loads the Products onto the carrier’s vehicle for shipment at the shipping point at which time risk of loss or damage will transfer to Client. Patheon will, in accordance with Client’s instructions and as agent for Client, (i) arrange for shipping, including preparing and executing a packing list, so that the Product will be delivered to the delivery address on the delivery date set forth in the applicable Firm Order, with such shipping to be paid by Client and (ii) at Client’s risk and expense, obtain any export license or other official authorization necessary to export the Products. Client will arrange for insurance and will select the freight carrier used by Patheon to ship Products and may monitor Patheon’s shipping and freight practices as they pertain to this Agreement. Products will be packed and transported in accordance with the Specifications. 

^^**Invoices and Payment.**

Invoices will be sent by email to the email address given by Client to Patheon in writing from time to time. Invoices will be sent when the Product is manufactured and released by Patheon to the Client. Patheon will also submit to Client, with each shipment of Products, a duplicate copy of the invoice covering the shipment. Patheon will also give Client an invoice covering any Inventory, Bill Back Items or Components which are to be purchased by Client under Section 5.2 of this Agreement. Each invoice will, to the extent applicable, identify Client’s Manufacturing Services purchase order number, Product numbers, names and quantities, unit price, freight charges, and the total amount to be paid by Client. Client will pay all undisputed invoices within [***] days of the date of confirmed facsimile or email transmission of the invoice. In the event that Client disputes any amounts under any invoice, such dispute will be resolved in accordance with Section 6.1 (with respect to non-conformance of Products) or otherwise under Article 12. Pending resolution of such dispute, Client will be obligated to pay any amounts under such invoice that are not in dispute. Upon resolution of any such dispute in favor of Patheon, the Client will pay all remaining amounts owing under such invoice within the later of (i) [* * *] Business days after such resolution or (ii) [* * *] days after the date of confirmed facsimile or email transmission of the invoice. The Late Delivery credits set forth in Section 5.2 are only available to Client if all outstanding undisputed invoices have been paid in full or are within 45 days outstanding from the invoice date when the Late Delivery arose.

\centered **PRODUCT CLAIMS AND RECALLS** 

^^**Product Claims.**

^^Product Claims. Client has the right to reject and return, at Patheon’s expense, any portion of any shipment of Products that deviates from the Specifications, cGMPs, or Applicable Laws without invalidating any remainder of the shipment. Client or its designated agent will visually inspect the Products manufactured by Patheon upon receipt thereof and will give Patheon written notice (a “**Deficiency Notice**”) of all claims for Products that deviate from the Specifications, cGMPs, or Applicable Laws within [* * *] days after Client’s receipt thereof. Should Client fail to give Patheon the Deficiency Notice within the applicable [* * *] day period, then the delivery will be deemed to have been accepted by Client on the [* * *] day after delivery or discovery, as applicable. Except as set out in Section 6.3, Patheon will have no liability for any deviations for which it has not received notice within the applicable [* * *] day period. 

^^Determination of Deficiency. Upon receipt of a Deficiency Notice, Patheon will have [* * *] days to advise Client by notice in writing that it disagrees with the contents of the Deficiency Notice. If Client and Patheon fail to agree within [* * *] days after Patheon’s notice to Client as to whether any Products identified in the Deficiency Notice deviate from the Specifications, cGMPs, or Applicable Laws, then the parties will mutually select an independent laboratory within [* * *] days of the parties’ failure to agree, which independent laboratory will evaluate if the Products deviate from the Specifications, cGMPs, or Applicable Laws. The parties will cause the independent laboratory to conduct its evaluation as promptly as reasonably practicable. This evaluation will be binding on the parties. If the evaluation certifies that any Products deviate from the Specifications, cGMPs, or Applicable Laws, Client may reject and return those Products in the manner contemplated in this Section 6.1 and Patheon will be responsible for the cost of the evaluation. If the evaluation does not so certify for any of the Products, then Client will be deemed to have accepted delivery of such Products which are deemed to be conforming on the date the evaluation is delivered by the independent laboratory to the parties and Client will be responsible for the cost of the evaluation and the return. With respect to any Products which Patheon agrees are deficient in accordance with the Deficiency Notice, or which are otherwise found to be deficient by the independent laboratory, Client will be entitled to the remedies set forth in Section 6.3(a). 

^^Latent Defects. For any Product defect that is not reasonably susceptible to discovery by visual inspection upon receipt of the Product, Client may give Patheon a Deficiency Notice within [***] days after [* * *] but not after [* * *]. 

^^Shortages. Claims for shortages in the amount of Products shipped by Patheon will be dealt with by reasonable agreement of the parties. 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

^^**Product Recalls and Returns.**

^^Records and Notice. Patheon and Client will each maintain records necessary to permit a Recall of any Products delivered to Client or customers of Client. Each party will promptly notify the other by telephone (to be confirmed in writing) of any information which might affect the marketability, safety or effectiveness of the Products or which might result in the Recall or seizure of the Products. Upon receiving this notice or upon this discovery, each party will stop making any further shipments of any Products in its possession or control until a decision has been made whether a Recall or some other corrective action is necessary. The decision to initiate a Recall or to take some other corrective action, if any, will be made and implemented by Client. “**Recall**” will mean any action (i) by Client to recover title to or possession of quantities of the Products sold or shipped to third parties (including, without limitation, the voluntary withdrawal of Products from the market); or (ii) by any regulatory authorities to detain or destroy any of the Products. Recall will also include any action by either Party to refrain from selling or shipping quantities of the Products to third parties which would have been subject to a Recall if sold or shipped. 

^^Recalls. If (i) any Authority issues a directive, order or, following the issuance of a safety warning or alert about a Product, a written request that any Product be Recalled, (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction orders a Recall, or (iii) Client determines that any Product should be Recalled or that a “Dear Doctor” letter is required relating the restrictions on the use of any Product, Patheon will co-operate as reasonably required by Client, having regard to all Applicable Laws. 

^^Product Returns. Client will have the responsibility for handling customer returns of the Products. Patheon will give Client any assistance that Client may reasonably require to handle the returns. 

^^**Patheon’s Responsibility for Defective and Recalled Products.**

^^Defective Product. If Client rejects Products under Section 6.1 and the deviation is determined to have arisen from Patheon’s failure to provide the Manufacturing Services in accordance with the Specifications, cGMPs, and/or Applicable Laws, or which is otherwise found to be deficient by an independent laboratory in accordance with Section 6.1, Patheon will credit Client’s account for Patheon’s invoice price for the defective Products (the “**Defective Product Credit Amount**”). If Client previously paid for the defective Products, Patheon will promptly, at Client’s election, either: (i) refund the Defective Product Credit Amount; or (ii) offset the Defective Product Credit Amount against other amounts due to Patheon hereunder. Patheon’s responsibility for any loss of Active Materials in Defective Product will be captured and calculated in the Active Materials Yield under Section 2.2. 

^^Recalled Product. If a Recall or return results from, or arises out of, a failure by Patheon to perform the Manufacturing Services in accordance with the Specifications, cGMPs, and Applicable Laws, Patheon will be responsible for the documented out-of-pocket expenses of the Recall or return and will promptly, at Client’s election, either: (i) refund the invoice price for such Recalled or returned Products (the “**Recalled Product Credit Amount**”); (ii) offset such Recalled Product Credit Amount against other amounts due to Patheon hereunder; or (iii) use its [***] efforts to replace such Recalled or returned Products with conforming Products within [* * *] days’ of the Client’s election under this Section 6.3(b) without the Client being liable for payment therefore, contingent upon the receipt from Client of all Active Materials required for the manufacture of the replacement Products. In all other circumstances, Recalls, returns, or other corrective actions will be made at Client’s direction, cost and expense. Patheon’s responsibility for any loss of Active Materials in Recalled Product will be captured and calculated in the Active Materials Yield under Section 2.2. 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

^^Except as set forth in Sections 6.3(a) and (b) above, and for breaches of its representations and warranties set forth in Section 9.3 below, Patheon will not be liable to Client nor have any responsibility to Client for any deficiencies in, or other liabilities associated with, any Product manufactured by it, (collectively, “**Product Claims**”). For greater certainty, Patheon will have no obligation for any Product Claims to the extent the Product Claim (i) is caused by deficiencies in the Specifications, the safety, efficacy, or marketability of the Products or any distribution thereof, (ii) results from a defect in a Component that is not reasonably discoverable by Patheon using the test methods set forth in the Specifications, (iii) results from a defect in the Active Materials or Components supplied by Client that is not reasonably discoverable by Patheon using the test methods set forth in the Specifications, (iv) is caused by actions of third parties occurring after the Product is shipped by Patheon under Section 5.4, (v) is due to packaging design or labelling defects or omissions for which Patheon has no responsibility, (vi) is due to any unascertainable reason despite Patheon having performed the Manufacturing Services in accordance with the Specifications, cGMP’s, and Applicable Laws, or (vii) is due to any other breach by Client of its obligations under this Agreement. 

^^**Disposition of Defective or Recalled Products****.**

Client will not dispose of any damaged, defective, returned, or Recalled Products for which it intends to assert a claim against Patheon without Patheon’s prior written authorization to do so, such authorization not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Alternatively, Patheon may instruct Client to return the Products to Patheon. Patheon will bear the cost of shipping, storage and disposition for any damaged, defective, returned or Recalled Products for which it bears responsibility under Section 6.3, and will promptly reimburse Client for any such costs which may be incurred directly by Client. In all other circumstances, Client will bear the cost of disposition, including all applicable fees for Manufacturing Services, for any damaged, defective, returned, or Recalled Products. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Client will have the right at all times to retain a reasonable sample of such Products for its own archival purposes. 

^^**Healthcare Provider or Patient Questions and Complaints; Adverse Event Reporting**

^^Client will have the sole responsibility for responding to questions and complaints from its customers. Questions or complaints received by Patheon from Client’s customers, healthcare providers or patients will be promptly (but in any event within [* * *] Business Days) referred to Client. Patheon will co-operate as reasonably required to allow Client to determine the cause of and resolve any questions and complaints. This assistance will include follow-up investigations, including testing. In addition, Patheon will give Client all mutually agreed upon information that will enable Client to respond properly to questions or complaints about the Products as set forth in the Quality Agreement. 

^^Patheon will notify Client promptly and in any event not later than [***] after it becomes aware of any Adverse Experience associated with the use of the Products, whether or not determined to be attributable to the Products, and whether or not deemed to be serious or non-serious. Such information will be sent to the Client as set forth in the Quality Agreement. 

^^If it is determined that the cause of the complaint or Adverse Experience resulted from a failure by Patheon to perform the Manufacturing Services in accordance with the Specifications, cGMPs, and Applicable Laws, Patheon will bear all costs incurred under this Section 6.5. In all other circumstances, such costs will be borne by Client. 

^^**Sole Remedy.**

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

Except for the indemnity set forth in Section 10.3 and subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.2, the remedies described in this Article 6 will be Client’s sole remedy for any failure by Patheon to provide the Manufacturing Services in accordance with the Specifications, cGMPs, and Applicable Laws. 

\centered **CO-OPERATION** 

^^**Quarterly Review.**

Each party will forthwith upon execution of this Agreement appoint one of its employees to be a relationship manager responsible for liaison between the parties. The relationship managers will meet not less than quarterly to review the current status of the business relationship and manage any issues that have arisen. 

^^**Governmental Agencies.**

Subject to Section 7.8, each party may communicate with any governmental agency, including but not limited to governmental agencies responsible for granting regulatory approval for the Products, regarding the Products if, in the opinion of that party’s counsel, the communication is necessary to comply with the terms of this Agreement or the requirements of any law, governmental order or regulation. Unless, in the reasonable opinion of its counsel, there is a legal prohibition against doing so, a party will permit the other party to accompany and take part in any communications with the agency, and to receive copies of all communications from the agency. 

^^**Records and Accounting by Patheon.**

Patheon will keep records of the manufacture, testing, and shipping of the Products, and retain samples of the Products, Active Materials and Components as are necessary to comply with all Applicable Laws, including any manufacturing regulatory requirements applicable to Patheon, the Manufacturing Site, the Products, the Active Materials and/or the Components, as well as to assist with resolving Product complaints and other similar investigations. Copies of the records and samples will be retained for a period of [***] following the date of Product expiry, or longer if required by law, at which time Client will be contacted concerning the delivery and destruction of the documents and/or samples of Products; provided that Patheon has first given Client [* * *] days notice of its intention to do so and the Client has not, in turn, instructed Patheon to ship such records or samples to Client at Client’s expense. Client is responsible for retaining samples of the Products necessary to comply with the legal/regulatory requirements applicable to Client. 

^^**Access.**

Patheon will give Client reasonable access at mutually agreeable times to the areas of the Manufacturing Site or any other facilities in which the Products are manufactured, stored, handled, or shipped to permit Client to verify that the Manufacturing Services are being performed in accordance with the Specifications, cGMPs, and Applicable Laws. But, with the exception of “for-cause” audits, Client will be limited each Year to [* * *] cGMP-type audit, lasting no more than [* * *] days, and involving no more than [* * *] auditors. Client may request additional cGMP-type audits, additional audit days, or the participation of additional auditors subject to payment to Patheon of a fee of $[* * *] for each additional audit day and $[* * *] per audit day for each additional auditor. The right of access set forth in this Section 7.5 will not include a right to access or inspect Patheon’s financial records.

At the Client’s request, Patheon will provide a copy of the Annual Product Review Report to the Client at no additional cost. Any additional report requested by Client beyond the scope of cGMPs and customary FDA requirements will be subject to an additional fee to be agreed upon between Patheon and the Client. 

^^**FDA Filings.**

^^Regulatory Authority. Client will have the sole responsibility for filing all documents with all Regulatory Authorities and taking any other actions that may be required for the receipt and/or maintenance of Regulatory Authority approval for the commercial manufacture of the Products, other than with respect to any Manufacturing Site licenses and/or registrations required to be obtained and maintained by Patheon. Patheon will assist Client, to the extent consistent with Patheon’s obligations under this Agreement, to obtain Regulatory Authority approval for the commercial manufacture of all Products as quickly as reasonably possible. 

^^Verification of Data. At least [***] days prior to filing any documents with any Regulatory Authority that incorporate data generated by Patheon, Client will give Patheon a copy of the documents incorporating this data to give Patheon the opportunity to verify the accuracy and regulatory validity of those documents as they relate to Patheon generated data. 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

^^Verification of CMC. At least [* * *] days prior to filing with any Regulatory Authority any documentation which is or is equivalent to the FDA’s Chemistry and Manufacturing Controls (“**CMC**”) related to any Marketing Authorization, such as a New Drug Application or Abbreviated New Drug Application, Client will give Patheon a copy of the CMC documentation as well as all supporting documents which have been relied upon to prepare the CMC documentation. This disclosure will permit Patheon to verify that the CMC documentation accurately describes the work that Patheon has performed and the manufacturing processes that Patheon will perform under this Agreement. Client will give Patheon copies of all FDA filings at the time of submission which contain CMC information regarding the Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Client may omit from the materials provided to Patheon any CMC documentation and supporting documents which have been previously provided to Patheon by Client and which have not been modified or edited by Client. 

^^Deficiencies. If, in Patheon’s sole discretion, acting reasonably, Patheon determines that any of the information given by Client under subsections (b) and (c) above is inaccurate or deficient in any manner whatsoever (the “**Deficiencies**”), Patheon will notify Client in writing of the Deficiencies. The parties will meet to discuss any such Deficiencies and will work together to resolve such Deficiencies before any pre-approval inspection, provided that to the extent of any disagreement concerning the form or content any information or submissions covered by subsections (b) and (c) above, Client will have the final decision-making authority. 

^^Client Responsibility. For clarity, the parties agree that in reviewing the documents referred to in subsections (b) and (c) above, Patheon’s role will be limited to verifying the accuracy of the description of the work undertaken or to be undertaken by Patheon. Subject to the foregoing, Patheon will not assume any responsibility for the accuracy of any application by Client for receipt of an approval by a Regulatory Authority. The Client is solely responsibility for the preparation and filing of the application for approval by the Regulatory Authorities and any relevant costs will be borne by the Client, except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.8. 

^^Inspection by Regulatory Authorities. If Client does not give Patheon the documents requested under subsection (b) above within the time specified and if Patheon reasonably believes that Patheon’s standing with a Regulatory Authority may be jeopardized, Patheon may, in its sole discretion, delay or postpone any inspection by the Regulatory Authority until Patheon has reviewed the requested documents and is satisfied with their contents. 

\centered **TERM AND TERMINATION** 

^^**Initial Term.**

This Agreement will become effective as of the Effective Date and will continue until [[Date 3]] of the Year that is five full Years after the Commencement Date of each Product (the “**Initial Term**”), unless terminated earlier by one of the parties in accordance herewith. This Agreement will automatically continue after the Initial Term for each Product for successive terms of two years (each, a “**Successive Term**”). Patheon may terminate this Agreement for any reason or no reason at any time during the Initial Term or any Successive Term with at least [***] prior written notice to Client. 

^^**Client Termination**

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

^^Client may terminate this Agreement, for any reason or no reason, at any time during the Initial Term or any Successive Term with at least [* * *] prior written notice (a “**Termination Notice**”) to Patheon (a “**Client Termination**”). 

^^Except for a termination under Sections 8.3 (a), (b) or (c), if there is a Client Termination for the [* * *] Product prior to the expiration of the Initial Term, Client shall pay to Patheon (i) $[* * *] if the date of the Termination Notice (the “**Notice Effective Date**”) occurs [* * *], (ii) $[* * *] if the Notice Effective Date occurs [* * *] or (iii) $[* * *] if the Notice Effective Date occurs [* * *] (the “**Client Termination Payment**”). Except for a termination under Sections 8.3 (a), (b) or (c), if there is a Client Termination for the [* * *] Product prior to the expiration of the [* * *], the Client Termination Payment shall be (i) $[* * *] if the Notice Effective Date occurs [* * *], (ii) $[* * *] if the Notice Effective Date occurs [* * *], or (iii) $[* * *] if the Notice Effective Date occurs [* * *]. For the avoidance of doubt, Client Terminations of the [* * *] and [* * *] Products as set forth above are separate and independent and will result in Client Termination Payments for each Product. The Client Termination Payment shall be due to Patheon no later than [* * *] business days following the effective date of the Client Termination. For the avoidance of doubt, no Client Termination Payment shall result from a Client Termination that is effective on or after the expiration of the Initial Term or from a Client Termination made under Sections 8.3 (a), (b) or (c). 

^^**Termination for Cause.**

^^Either party at its sole option may terminate this Agreement upon written notice (the “**Termination Notice**”) where the other party has failed to remedy a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, or other obligations under this Agreement within [* * *] days following receipt of a written notice of the breach that reasonably identifies the breach and expressly states that it is a notice under this Section 8.3(a) (a “**Breach Notice**”). The aggrieved party’s right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.3(a) may only be exercised for a period of [* * *] days following the Termination Notice (where the breach has not been remedied) and if the termination right is not exercised during this period then the aggrieved party will be deemed to have waived the breach of the representation, warranty, or obligation described in the Breach Notice. 

^^Either party at its sole option may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice, but without prior advance notice, to the other party if: (i) the other party is declared insolvent or bankrupt by a court of competent jurisdiction; (ii) a voluntary petition of bankruptcy is filed in any court of competent jurisdiction by the other party; or (iii) this Agreement is assigned by the other party for the benefit of creditors. 

^^Client may terminate this Agreement as to any Product upon [***] days’ prior written notice if any Authority takes any action, or raises any objection, that prevents Client from importing, exporting, purchasing, or selling the Product. But if this occurs, Client will still fulfill all of its obligations under Section 8.5 below. 

^^Patheon may terminate this Agreement upon [* * *] months’ prior written notice if Client assigns under Section 13.6 any of its rights under this Agreement to an assignee that, in the opinion of Patheon acting reasonably, is: (i) not a credit worthy substitute for Client; or (ii) a Patheon Competitor. 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

^^**Product Discontinuation.**

Client will give at least [* * *] months’ advance notice if it intends to no longer order Manufacturing Services for a Product due to this Product’s discontinuance in the market. 

^^**Obligations on Termination.**

If this Agreement is completed, expires, or is terminated in whole or in part for any reason, then: 

^^Patheon will cease the manufacture of Products and will terminate any unfilled orders with third parties that Patheon may have previously submitted with respect to Components, to the extent such orders may be terminated or revoked; 

^^Client will (i) take delivery of and pay for any undelivered Products, at the Price in effect at the time the order for such Products was placed, and (ii) take delivery of any unused Active Materials. Patheon will cooperate with Client in the surrender, delivery and transfer of these items as promptly as is commercially reasonable, with any shipping and related expenses to be borne by Client; 

^^Client will purchase, at Patheon’s out-of-pocket costs (including all such costs incurred by Patheon for the purchase and handling of the Inventory), the Inventory applicable to the Products which was purchased, produced or maintained by Patheon in contemplation of filling Firm Orders or in accordance with Section 5.2 prior to notice of termination being given; 

^^Client will satisfy the purchase price payable under Patheon’s non-cancellable orders with suppliers of Components, if the orders were made by Patheon prior to notice of termination being given and in reliance on Firm Orders or in accordance with Section 5.2; 

^^Client will purchase from Patheon any existing work-in-process held by Patheon, at a price to be mutually agreed in good faith. But if Client terminates this Agreement under Section 8.3(a), Client, at its option, may purchase from Patheon any existing work-in-progress held by Patheon, at a price to be mutually agreed in good faith. 

^^Client will make [***] efforts, at its own expense, to remove from Patheon site(s), within [* * *] Business Days, all of Client’s Components, Inventory and Materials (whether current or obsolete), supplies, undelivered Product, chattels, capital equipment or other moveable property owned by Client, related to the Agreement and located at a Patheon site or that is otherwise under Patheon’s care and control **(“Client Property”**). If Client fails to remove the Client Property within [* * *] Business Days following the completion, termination, or expiration of the Agreement Client will pay Patheon $[* * *] per pallet, per [* * *], [* * *] [* * *] minimum ($[* * *] per pallet, per [* * *], [* * *] minimum, for any of the Client Property that contains controlled substances or requires refrigeration) thereafter for storing the Client Property and will assume any third party storage charges invoiced to Patheon regarding the Client Property. Patheon will invoice Client for the storage charges as set forth in Section 5.6 of this Agreement; and 

^^upon the request of Client, and at Client’s expense, Patheon will provide such assistance as is reasonably necessary to assist Client in transferring the manufacture of the Product to another facility; provided, however, that Client acknowledges that no competitor of Patheon will be permitted access to the Manufacturing Site; and 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

Any termination or expiration of this Agreement will not affect any outstanding obligations or payments due hereunder prior to the termination or expiration, nor will it prejudice any other remedies that the parties may have under this Agreement. For greater certainty, termination of this Agreement for any reason will not affect the obligations and responsibilities of the parties under Articles 10 and 11 and Sections 5.4, 5.5, 8.4, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, and 13.15, all of which survive any termination.

Client will give Patheon a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the requested confidential treatment of this Agreement prior to filing with the SEC. 

\centered **REMEDIES AND INDEMNITIES** 

^^**Consequential Damages.**

Under no circumstances whatsoever will either party be liable to the other in contract, tort, negligence, breach of statutory duty, or otherwise for (i) any (direct or indirect) loss of profits, of production, of anticipated savings, of business, or goodwill or (ii) for any other liability, damage, costs, or expense of any kind incurred by the other party of an indirect or consequential nature, regardless of any notice of the possibility of these damages. 

^^**Limitation of Liability.**

^^Active Materials. Except as expressly set forth in Section 2.2 and Article 6, under no circumstances will Patheon be responsible for any loss or damage to the Active Materials. Patheon’s maximum responsibility for loss or damage to the Active Materials will not exceed [***] set forth in Schedule D. 

^^Maximum Annual Liability. Except for any liability arising under Section 2.2.4 for a Casualty Loss or under Section 10.3, Patheon’s maximum liability to Client under this Agreement [* * *], for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, any liability arising under Article 6 hereof or resulting from any and all breaches of its representations, warranties, or any other obligations under this Agreement will not exceed [* * *] the [* * *] of (i) $[* * *] USD or (ii) [* * *]% of Patheon’s revenues received pursuant to this Agreement, up to a maximum amount of $[* * *] USD in the aggregate*.*

Patheon agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Client, its officers, employees, and agents harmless against any and all losses, damages, costs, claims, demands, judgments and liability to, from and/or in favour of third parties (other than Affiliates) resulting from, or relating to (i) a failure by Patheon to perform the Manufacturing Services in accordance with the Specifications, cGMPs, or Applicable Laws, or (ii) any other breach of this Agreement by Patheon, including, without limitation, any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, except to the extent that the losses, damages, costs, claims, demands, judgments, and liability are due to the negligence or wrongful act(s) of Client, its officers, employees, agents, or Affiliates.

^^**Indemnification Procedure**

If a claim occurs for which a party has an indemnification obligation under Section 10.3 or 10.4, the indemnified party (the “**Indemnitee**”) will: (a) promptly notify the indemnifying party (the “**Indemnitor**”) in writing of the claim; (b) use [***] efforts to mitigate the effects of the claim; (c) reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor in the defense of the claim; and (d) permit the Indemnitor to control the defense and settlement of the claim, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, all at the Indemnitor’s cost and expense. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of the claim, the Indemnitee may participate in such defense with the Indemnitee’s own counsel who will be retained, at the Indemnitee’s sole cost and expense; provided, however, that neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnitee will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the claim without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnitee withholds consent in respect of a judgment or settlement involving only the payment of money by the Indemnitor and which would not involve any stipulation or admission of liability or result in the Indemnitee becoming subject to injunctive relief or other relief, the Indemnitor will have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnitee within [* * *] days after receipt of the Indemnitee’s written denial of consent, to pay to the Indemnitee, or to a trust for its or the applicable third party’s benefit, such amount established by such judgment or settlement in addition to all interest, costs or other charges relating thereto, together with all attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred to such date for which the Indemnitor is obligated under this Agreement, if any, at which time the Indemnitor’s rights and obligations with respect to such claim will cease. The Indemnitor will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a claim by the Indemnitee which is reached without the written consent of the Indemnitor. 

^^**Reasonable Allocation of Risk.**

This Agreement (including, without limitation, this Article 10) is reasonable and creates a reasonable allocation of risk for the relative profits the parties each expect to derive from the Products. Patheon assumes only a limited degree of risk arising from the manufacture, distribution, and use of the Products because Client has developed and holds the marketing approval for the Products, Client requires Patheon to manufacture and label the Products strictly in accordance with the Specifications, cGMPs and Applicable Law, and Client, not Patheon, is best positioned to inform and advise potential users about the circumstances and manner of use of the Products. 

\centered **CONFIDENTIALITY** 

^^**Confidentiality.**

The Confidentiality Agreement will apply to all Confidential Information disclosed by the parties under this Agreement. If the Confidentiality Agreement expires or is terminated prior to the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement will continue to govern the parties’ obligations of confidentiality for any Confidential Information disclosed by the parties hereunder, for the term of this Agreement and seven years thereafter, as though the Confidentiality Agreement remained in full force and effect. 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

\centered **DISPUTE RESOLUTION** 

^^**Commercial Disputes.**

If any dispute arises out of this Agreement (other than a dispute under Section 6.1(b) or a Technical Dispute, as defined herein), the parties will first try to resolve it amicably. In that regard, any party may send a notice of dispute to the other, and each party will appoint, within [***] Business Days from receipt of the notice of dispute, a single representative having full power and authority to solve the dispute. The representatives will meet as necessary in order to resolve the dispute. If the representatives fail to resolve the matter within [* * *] from their appointment, or if a party fails to appoint a representative within the [* * *] Business Day period set forth above, the dispute will immediately be referred to the Chief Operating Officer, or in the absence of such officer, the Chief Executive Officer (or another officer as he/she may designate) of each party who will meet and discuss as necessary to try to resolve the dispute amicably. Should the parties fail to reach a resolution under this Section 12.1, the dispute will be referred to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 13.15. 

^^**Technical Dispute Resolution.**

If a dispute arises (other than disputes under Sections 6.1(b) or 12.1) between the parties that is exclusively related to technical aspects of the manufacturing, packaging, labelling, quality control testing, handling, storage, or other activities under this Agreement (a “**Technical Dispute**”), the parties will make all reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute by amicable negotiations. In that regard, senior representatives of each party will, as soon as practicable and in any event no later than [* * *] Business Days after a written request from either party to the other, meet in good faith to resolve any Technical Dispute. If, despite this meeting, the parties are unable to resolve a Technical Dispute within a reasonable time, and in any event within [* * *] Business Days of the written request, the Technical Dispute will, at the request of either party, be referred for determination to an expert in accordance with Schedule D. If the parties cannot agree that a dispute is a Technical Dispute, Section 12.1 will prevail. For greater certainty, the parties agree that the release of the Products for sale or distribution under the applicable marketing approval for the Products will not by itself indicate compliance by Patheon with its obligations for the Manufacturing Services and further that nothing in this Agreement (including Schedule D) will remove or limit the authority of the relevant qualified person (as specified by the Quality Agreement) to determine whether the Products are to be released for sale or distribution. 

\centered **MISCELLANEOUS** 

^^**Inventions.**

^^For the term of this Agreement, Client hereby grants to Patheon a non-exclusive, paid-up, royalty-free, non-transferable and non-sub licensable license of Client’s Intellectual Property which Patheon must use in order to perform the Manufacturing Services. 

^^All Inventions and Intellectual Property generated or derived by Patheon while performing the Manufacturing Services, to the extent it is specific to the development, manufacture, use, and sale of Client’s Product or Active Materials that are the subject of the Manufacturing Services (including, but not limited to, any new use, new formulation or any change in the method of producing, testing or storing any Product), will be the exclusive property of Client. Patheon will execute such instruments as will be required to evidence or effectuate the Client’s ownership of any such Inventions or other Intellectual Property, and will cooperate upon reasonable request in the prosecution of patents and other Intellectual Property rights related thereto. 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

^^All Patheon Intellectual Property will be the exclusive property of Patheon. Patheon hereby grants to Client a worldwide perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, paid-up, royalty-free, transferable and sub licensable license to use the Patheon Intellectual Property used by Patheon to perform the Manufacturing Services to enable Client to manufacture and have manufactured the Product(s) and to use, import, export, offer to sell, and sell the same, with full right to sublicense to any third party in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of the Product. 

^^Each party will be solely responsible for the costs of filing, prosecution, and maintenance of patents and patent applications on its own Inventions. 

^^Either party will give the other party written notice, as promptly as practicable, of all Inventions which can reasonably be deemed to constitute improvements or other modifications of the Products or processes or technology owned or otherwise controlled by the party. 

^^**Intellectual Property.**

Subject to Section 13.1, all Client Intellectual Property will be owned by Client and all Patheon Intellectual Property will be owned by Patheon. Neither party has, nor will it acquire, any interest in any of the other party’s Intellectual Property unless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing. Neither party will use any Intellectual Property of the other party, except as specifically authorized by the other party or as required for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Each party hereby acknowledges that it does not have, and will not acquire any interest in any of the other party’s trademarks or trade names unless otherwise expressly agreed. Each party agrees not to use any trademarks or trade names of the other party, except as specifically authorized by the other party in writing both as to the names or marks which may be used and as to the manner and prominence of use. All goodwill in any trademarks will inure to the benefit of the trademark owner. Client, in its sole discretion, will determine the trademarks and trade names owned or licensed by Client to be used in connection with the Products, including without limitation, the trademarks and trade names which will appear on the labels, packaging, and any promotional or other materials related to the Products. Patheon will use those trademarks and trade names notified by Client to Patheon for use in the labelling and packaging of the Products, and Patheon will use only such notified trademarks and trade names for such purpose. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Patheon will immediately cease using all of Client’s trademarks and trade names. 

^^**Insurance.**

Each party will maintain commercial general liability insurance, including contractual liability insurance covering the obligations of that party under this Agreement through the term of this Agreement and for a period of three years thereafter. This insurance will have policy limits of not less than (i) $[***] for each occurrence for personal injury or property damage liability; and (ii) $[* * *] in the aggregate per annum for product and completed operations liability. If requested each party will give the other a certificate of insurance evidencing the above and showing the name of the issuing company, the policy number, the effective date, the expiration date, and the limits of liability. The insurance certificate will further provide for a minimum of [* * *] days’ written notice to the insured of a cancellation of the insurance. If a party is unable to maintain the insurance policies required under this Agreement through no fault of its own, then the party will forthwith notify the other party in writing and the parties will in good faith negotiate appropriate amendments to the insurance provision of this Agreement in order to provide adequate assurances. 

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

^^**Independent Contractors.**

The parties are independent contractors and this Agreement will not be construed to create between Patheon and Client any other relationship such as, by way of example only, that of employer-employee, principal agent, joint-venturer, co-partners, or any similar relationship, the existence of which is expressly denied by the parties. 

^^**No Waiver.**

Either party’s failure to require the other party to comply with any provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of the provision or any other provision of this Agreement, with the exception of Sections 6.1 and 8.3. No waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by the waiving party. 

^^**Assignment.**

^^Patheon may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the written consent of Client, this consent not to be unreasonably withheld. But Patheon may arrange for subcontractors to perform specific testing services arising under this Agreement without the consent of Client; provided, however, that Patheon will provide advance notice of the name and function of any such subcontractor and will ensure such subcontractor’s adherence to the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the obligations of confidentiality set forth in Article 11. 

^^Subject to Section 8.3(d), Client may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without approval from Patheon. But Client will give Patheon prior written notice of any assignment (where and to the extent possible), any assignee will covenant in writing with Patheon to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and Client will remain liable hereunder. Any partial assignment will be subject to Patheon’s cost review of the assigned Products and Patheon may terminate this Agreement or any assigned part thereof, on [***] months’ prior written notice to Client and the assignee if good faith discussions do not lead to agreement on amended Manufacturing Service fees within a reasonable time. 

^^Despite the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.6, (i) either party may assign this Agreement without the other party’s consent to any of its Affiliates or to a successor to or purchaser of all or substantially all of it business, (ii) Client may assign this Agreement without Patheon’s consent to a successor to or purchaser of all or substantially all of it assets or business to which this Agreement relates, but in each case (i) and (ii), the assignee must execute an agreement with the non-assigning party whereby it agrees to be bound hereunder. 

^^**Force Majeure.**

Neither party will be liable for the failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement if the failure is caused by an event beyond that party’s reasonable control and not reasonably preventable by such party, including, but not limited to, strikes or other labor disturbances, lockouts, riots, quarantines, communicable disease outbreaks, wars, acts of terrorism, fires, floods, storms, interruption of or delay in transportation, defective equipment, lack of or inability to obtain fuel, power or components, or compliance with any order or regulation of any government entity acting within colour of right (a “**Force Majeure Event**”). A party claiming a right to excused performance under this Section 13.7 will immediately notify the other party in writing of the extent of its inability to perform, which notice will specify the event that prevents the performance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such party will be excused by reason of the Force Majeure Event only so long as it is exercising commercially reasonable efforts to overcome such event. Neither party will be entitled to rely on a Force Majeure Event to relieve it from an obligation to pay money (including any interest for delayed payment) which would otherwise be due and payable under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Force Majeure Event prevents a party’s performance under this Agreement for an aggregate of [***] days, the other party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the non-performing party.

^^**Severability.**

If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, that determination will not impair or affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof, because each provision is separate, severable, and distinct.

^^**Other Terms.**

No terms, provisions or conditions of any purchase order or other business form or written authorization used by Client or Patheon will have any effect on the rights, duties, or obligations of the parties under or otherwise modify this Agreement, regardless of any failure of Client or Patheon to object to the terms, provisions, or conditions unless the document specifically refers to this Agreement and is signed by both parties. 

^^**No Third Party Benefit or Right.**

For greater certainty, nothing in this Agreement will confer or be construed as conferring on any third party any benefit or the right to enforce any express or implied term of this Agreement. 

^^**Execution in Counterparts.**

This Agreement will be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of law provisions, and the laws of the United States of America applicable therein and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts thereof. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement.

\centered **SCHEDULE D** 

\centered **TECHNICAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION** 

Technical Disputes which cannot be resolved by negotiation as provided in Section 12.2 will be resolved in the following manner: 

^**Appointment of Expert**. Within [***] Business Days after a party requests under Section 12.2 that an expert be appointed to resolve a Technical Dispute, the parties will jointly appoint a mutually acceptable expert with experience and expertise in the subject matter of the dispute. If the parties are unable to so agree within the [* * *] Business Day period, or in the event of disclosure of a conflict by an expert under Paragraph 2 hereof which results in the parties not confirming the appointment of the expert, then an expert (willing to act in that capacity hereunder) will be appointed by an experienced arbitrator on the roster of the American Arbitration Association. 

^**Conflicts of Interest**. Any person appointed as an expert will be entitled to act and continue to act as an expert even if at the time of his appointment or at any time before he gives his determination, he has or may have some interest or duty which conflicts or may conflict with his appointment if before accepting the appointment (or as soon as practicable after he becomes aware of the conflict or potential conflict) he fully discloses the interest or duty and the parties will, after the disclosure, have confirmed his appointment. 

^**Procedure**. Where an expert is appointed: 

^^Timing. The expert will be so appointed on condition that (i) he promptly fixes a reasonable time and place for receiving representations, submissions or information from the parties and that he issues the authorizations to the parties and any relevant third party for the proper conduct of his determination and any hearing and (ii) he renders his decision (with full reasons) within [* * *] Business Days (or another other date as the parties and the expert may agree) after receipt of all information requested by him under Paragraph 4(b) hereof.

^^Disclosure of Evidence. The parties undertake one to the other to give to any expert all the evidence and information within their respective possession or control as the expert may reasonably consider necessary for determining the matter before him which they will disclose promptly and in any event within [* * *] Business Days of a written request from the relevant expert to do so.

^^Advisors. Each party may appoint any counsel, consultants and advisors as it feels appropriate to assist the expert in his determination and so as to present their respective cases so that at all times the parties will co-operate and seek to narrow and limit the issues to be determined.

^^Appointment of New Expert. If within the time specified in Paragraph 4(a) above the expert will not have rendered a decision in accordance with his appointment, a new expert may (at the request of either party) be appointed and the appointment of the existing expert will thereupon cease for the purposes of determining the matter at issue between the parties save this if the existing expert renders his decision with full reasons prior to the appointment of the new expert, then this decision will have effect and the proposed appointment of the new expert will be withdrawn.

*** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 

^^Final and Binding. The determination of the expert will, except for fraud or manifest error, be final and binding upon the parties.

^^Costs. Each party will bear its own costs for any matter referred to an expert hereunder and, in the absence of express provision in the Agreement to the contrary, the costs and expenses of the expert will be borne by the losing party.

For greater certainty, the release of the Products for sale or distribution under the applicable marketing approval for the Products will not by itself indicate compliance by Patheon with its obligations for the Manufacturing Services and further that nothing in this Agreement (including this Schedule D) will remove or limit the authority of the relevant qualified person (as specified by the Quality Agreement) to determine whether the Products are to be released for sale or distribution.
