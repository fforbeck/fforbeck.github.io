Please avoid padding wherever possible. Any wrapping and any padding should be made of one type of materials for environmental reasons. Padding must not be made of plastics, polystyrene or industrial waste material.

Only EURO-pallets (120 x 80 cm) may be used! The total height (incl. Pallet base) must not exceed 150 cm. Projections of up to 5 cm will be tolerated. In principal all pallets have to be delivered only with one type of goods and the packaging units have to be assembled on the pallet so that the labels can be read from the front (the side with dimensions of 80 cm). Two articles per pallet may be delivered if it is possible to clearly keep the boxes apart in two halves (40 x 120 each) and all the other requirements can be fulfilled.

^New products, new versions/updates of Productss and recalls

^new version of a product is not only a change of content but also any change to its dimensions in length, height and width for more than

+/- 1 mm and changes in weight of more than +/- 2 grams per item.

Under no circumstances may new version of products bear an already used bar code or article number. New versions of products may never be delivered on the basis of an order for an old / to be discontinued version.

KOCH Media has to be informed of deletions or the introduction of a new version at least 4 weeks before a new quarter (1.1/ 1.4 / 1.7 / 1.10) the new product is introduced or the old is being deleted. KOCH Media will return all stocks of a deleted product without repackaging.

^Goods-in differences  
Please verify all and any differences in delivered items reported by the KOCH Media goods-in department. We assume you accept these differences unless you reply differently within two (2) working days.

You will be informed of erroneous deliveries, which are kept ready for collection. Should you fail to collect the goods within 14 days, KOCH Media will return all goods at your cost (you will pay delivery charges on receipt of goods).

^Faulty goods and returns  
Goods already damaged on delivery (damage during transport etc.) will be reported to the supplier within 48 hours of delivery and will be destroyed or returned at your cost depending on our agreement with you. Damaged of faulty goods returned by our clients will be accepted by KOCH Media and destroyed after informing the supplier.

KOCH Media always checks goods returned by our clients with regards to cleanness and quality. Then the goods will be re-stocked. This only applies to goods where there is a good chance (stocks, product life cycle) that these goods can be re-delivered.

Goods on consignment, which are no longer corresponding to the internal requirements to be re-stocked, are not repackaged and will be returned to the supplier. Depending on the agreement with the supplier KOCH Media may be in a position to destroy these goods.

^Transport guidelines  
Should in exceptional cases the freight costs of delivered goods be borne by KOCH Media, the goods may only be handed over to the shipping agent commissioned by KOCH Media. Should the supplier send the goods using a different transport agent, he will have to bear these costs in full.
