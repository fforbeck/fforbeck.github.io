With respect to liability insurance coverage written subject to aggregate limits of liability on a policy year basis, each and every accident or loss shall mean the cumulative amount of all losses proceeding from one event. For the purposes of this paragraph, all losses having a common origin and traceable to the same cause, omission, or mistake occurring during any one policy year shall be considered one event. Where the Company issues more than one such policy to the same policyholder such policies shall together be treated as though they were one policy. Losses under such policies shall for the purposes of this reinsurance contract be deemed to have occurred in the calendar year in which the inception date of the policy falls, except that as respects such policies issued for a period in excess of twelve months, losses for the first twelve month period shall be deemed to have occurred in the calendar year in which the inception date of the policy falls and losses for each succeeding twelve month period or part thereof shall be deemed to have occurred in the calendar year in which the anniversary date of the policy starting such period falls.

^Fidelity and Forgery

All losses resulting from any fraudulent or dishonest act or omission or series thereof on the part of any one person or of several persons acting in collusion (whether employees or not) and irrespective of the number of the Company’s obligations involved; provided, that in the case of any loss involving two or more persons acting in collusion, losses resulting from separate acts or omissions on the part of each such person shall be included as part of such loss.

^It is further agreed that each and every loss resulting from a series of acts or omissions, some prior to and some subsequent to midnight on

Page 18 of 26 

the effective date of this Contract shall be disregarded.

As regards losses arising under policies and/or contracts covering on a “losses discovered” or “claims made during” basis (that is to say policies and/or contracts in which the date of discovery of the loss, or the date the claim is made against the insured or is first notified to the Company, determines under which policy and/or contract the loss is collectible), such losses are covered hereunder and the date of the discovery of such loss or the date such claim is made or first notified shall be deemed to be the date of loss for the purposes of this Contract, provided that the date of the discovery of the loss or the date the claim is made or first notified falls within the period covered by this Contract.

For the purposes of the foregoing the date of first discovery of a “loss” or the date the claim is first made against an insured or first notified to the Company shall be the date applicable to the entire loss and/or claim and the Reinsurers shall be liable for their proportion of the entire loss and/or claim irrespective of the expiry date of this Contract and provided that such first discovery date or first date such claim is made or notified falls within the period of this Contract.

^If an “occurrence” or “accident” policy is identified as being involved then the date of loss shall be the date as determined under the occurrence or accident policy, or

^If no “occurrence” or “accident” policy is identified as being involved, then the date of the loss will be the date the first claim is made or discovered under a “claims-made” or “losses discovered” policy. If an occurrence policy is identified after date of loss is established under

^^^^^ 
Page 19 of 26 

^, the date of loss shall not be changed. Only one date of loss may be established for any event.
