If the Company’s total shareholder return for the Peer Group Performance Period is greater than the 25th percentile of the Peer Group’s performance and less than the 50th percentile of the Peer Group’s performance, then the number of Restricted Shares that shall vest shall be AAA Restricted Shares plus the result of the following calculation (rounded to the nearest whole share): AAA times (the Company’s percentile in comparison to the Peer Group of the Company’s total shareholder return during the Peer Group Performance Period (expressed as a decimal) less ..25) divided by .25.

Such delivery may take the form of an electronic transfer of the vested Restricted Shares to the Grantee’s brokerage or other financial account. The Grantee shall execute and deliver to the Company a blank stock power so that the Restricted Shares that may be forfeited can be canceled.

^Notwithstanding the foregoing, in addition to the vesting of the Restricted Shares set forth above, the Restricted Shares shall no longer be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and shall vest upon the occurrence a event described below.

^^a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in the Plan); or

^^the termination “without cause” (defined below) of the Grantee’s employment by the Company; provided, however only in proportion to the number of months, including any partial month, elapsed in the vesting period divided by 36.

^certificate or certificates representing the vested Restricted Shares under Award I shall be delivered to the Grantee or the Grantee’s estate after the occurrence of an event described above as soon as practical.

In the event of the Grantee’s death, Permanent Disability or termination without cause Award II shall vest in amounts (and subject to the pro rata provisions for death, Permanent Disability and termination without cause) in accordance with the Company’s total shareholder return during the Peer Group Performance Period as determined under the metrics of Section 2 above.

In the event of a Change in Control of the Company Award II shall vest in amounts which assume the Company’s total shareholder return during the Peer Group Performance Period is equal to the 50th percentile of the Peer Group’s performance. A certificate or certificates representing the earned Restricted Shares under Award II shall be delivered to the Grantee as promptly as practical after the Change in Control.

Termination shall be deemed to be “without cause” unless the Board of Directors of the Company, or its designee, in good faith determines that termination is because of any one or more of the following, in which case such termination shall be deemed to be for “cause”:

The Grantee’s:  
^^fraud;

^^misappropriation of funds from the Company;

^^commission of a felony or of an act or series of acts which result in material injury to the business reputation of the Company;

^^commission of a crime or act or series of acts involving moral turpitude;

^^commission of an act or series of repeated acts of dishonesty that are materially inimical to the best interests of the Company;

^^willful and repeated failure to perform his duties, which failure has not been cured within fifteen (15) days after the Company gives notice thereof to the Grantee;

^^material breach of any material provision of an employment agreement, if any, which breach has not been cured in all substantial respects within ten (10) days after the Company gives notice thereof to the Grantee; or

^^failure to carry out the reasonable directions or instructions of the Grantee’s superiors, provided the directions or instructions are consistent with the duties of the Grantee’s office, which failure has not been cured in all substantial respects within ten (10) days after the Company gives notice thereof to the Grantee.

Provided, however, the Company’s obligation to provide notice and an opportunity to cure, pursuant to subsections 5(f)-(h) above, shall only apply to the Grantee’s first breach, first failure to perform or first failure to follow directions, as the case may be, of the nature giving rise to the right of the Company to provide notice thereof. In addition, the Grantee may terminate his employment with the Company, and such termination shall be deemed a termination by the Company “without cause” if:

^^the Company reduces the Grantee’s title, responsibilities, power or authority in comparison with his title, responsibilities, power or authority on the date hereof;

^^the Company assigns the Grantee duties which are inconsistent with the duties assigned to the Grantee on the date hereof and which duties the Company persists in assigning to the Grantee despite the prior written objection of the Grantee; or

^^the Company reduces the Grantee’s annual base compensation (unless such decrease is proportionate with a decrease in the base compensation of the officers of the Company as a group), or materially reduces his group health, life, disability or other insurance programs, his pension, retirement or profit-sharing benefits or any benefits provided by the Company, or excludes him from any plan, program or arrangement, including but not limited to bonus or incentive plans.

^On any change in the number or kind of outstanding common shares of the Company by reason of a recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, separation, liquidation, share split, share dividend, combination of shares or any other change in the corporate structure or Common Shares of the Company, the Company, by action of the Committee, is empowered to make such adjustment, if any, in the number and kind of Restricted Shares subject to this Agreement as it considers appropriate for the protection of the Company and of the Grantee.

^No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includable in the gross income of the Grantee for federal income tax purposes with respect to the Restricted Shares granted hereunder, the Grantee shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding the payment of, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to that amount. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, minimum statutory withholding obligations may be settled with previously owned Common Shares or Restricted Shares that have vested. The making of that payment or those arrangements is a condition to the obligations of the Company under the Plan, and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise payable to the Grantee.

^Nothing in this Agreement shall affect in any manner any conflicting or other provision of any other agreement between the Grantee and the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit whatever right the Company might otherwise have to terminate the employment of the Grantee.

^The laws of the State of Ohio govern this Agreement, the Plan and the Restricted Shares granted hereby.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused its corporate name to be subscribed by its duly authorized officer as of the [[Date 3: Date]].
