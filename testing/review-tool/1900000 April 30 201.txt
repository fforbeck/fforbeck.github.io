Promise to Pay. 

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, AEROSONIC CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), promises to pay to the order of M&I MARSHALL & ILSLEY BANK (the “Bank”), in lawful money of the United States of America, in immediately available funds, at the office of the Bank at 501 East Kennedy Boulevard, Suite 900, [[Address 1: Address]], or at such other location as the Bank may designate from time to time, the principal amount of ONE MILLION NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 1]]), together with interest thereon, as described in this Interest Bearing Installment Note (the “Note”). 

Maturity Date. 

The entire principal amount of this Note together with all accrued, unpaid interest shall be payable in full on [[Date 2: Date]] (the “Maturity Date”). 

Loan Agreement; Loan Documents. 

This Note is delivered pursuant and subject to the terms of that certain Loan Agreement of even date entered into by and between the Bank and Borrower (as amended, modified, and/or restated and in legal force and effect from time to time, the “Loan Agreement”), and payment and performance under this Note is secured by, among other things, the Security Agreement, Mortgage and Guaranty executed and delivered pursuant to the Loan Agreement. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Loan Agreement. 

Interest Prior to Default. 

Prior to an Event of Default, commencing on the date of this Note and continuing through and including the Maturity Date, interest shall accrue on the outstanding principal balance of this Note at the rate specified in the Loan Agreement. 

Default Rate of Interest. 

From and after the Maturity Date or upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, interest shall accrue on the balance of principal remaining unpaid during any such period at the default rate specified in the Loan Agreement. 

Payment Terms. 

Payments of principal and interest due under this Note, if not sooner declared to be due in accordance with the provisions of this Note, shall be due and payable as follows: 

Payment of Interest. Commencing on the first day after the first full month after the date of this Note, and continuing on the same day of each and every calendar month thereafter through and including the month in which the Maturity Date occurs, payments of accrued and unpaid interest on the principal balance of this Note outstanding from time to time shall be due and payable in full. 

Payment of Principal. 

Borrower shall repay principal in equal installments of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] commencing on the first day after the first full month after the Closing Date, and continuing on the same day of each and every calendar month thereafter until the Maturity Date. On the Maturity Date, Borrower shall repay the remaining unpaid principal balance of this Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest payable thereon, and any other amounts due and payable by Borrower under this Note or under any of the other Loan Documents. 

In the event Borrower receives any proceeds from the sale of the Virginia Property, Borrower shall immediately remit such proceeds to the Bank and such proceeds shall be applied as a principal payment under this Note. 

Late Payment Charge. 

If any payment of interest or principal due under this Note prior to the Maturity Date is not made within fifteen (15) days after such payment is due in accordance with this Note, then, in addition to the payment of the amount due, Borrower shall pay to the Bank a “late charge” in an amount equal to five percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the amount so overdue to defray part of the cost to the Bank of collection and handling such late payment. The imposition or collection of any late charge pursuant to this section does not constitute and shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Bank of any of its rights and remedies under this Note or any of the other Loan Documents. 

Maximum Amount of Interest. 

Nothing herein, nor any transaction related hereto, shall be construed to operate so as to require Borrower to pay interest at a greater rate than shall be lawful. Should any interest or other charges paid by Borrower in connection with the loan evidenced by this Note result in computation or earning of interest in excess of the maximum contract rate of interest which is legally permitted under applicable Florida law or federal preemption statute, then any and all such excess is hereby waived by the Bank and shall be automatically credited against and in reduction of the balance due hereunder, and any portion which exceeds such balance shall be paid by the Bank to Borrower. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if for any reason the effective rate of interest on this Note should exceed the maximum lawful rate, the effective rate shall be deemed reduced to and shall be such maximum lawful rate. To the extent permitted by the law, all sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Bank for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of this Note. When determining the maximum legal contract rate of interest allowed to be contracted for by applicable law as changed from time to time, unless otherwise prescribed by law, interest shall be calculated on the basis of a three hundred sixty-five (365) or three hundred sixty-six (366) day year, as the case may be, as compared to the payment rate which is computed on a three hundred sixty (360) day year for actual days elapsed. 

Prepayment. 

This Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty. 

Event of Default; Remedies. 

The Bank has the right to declare the total unpaid principal balance and all accrued but unpaid interest payable under this Note to be immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement. 

Exercise of this right shall be without notice to Borrower, notice of such exercise being hereby expressly waived. In addition to the right to declare the total unpaid principal balance and all accrued but unpaid interest payable under this Note to be due and payable in full in advance of the Maturity Date, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Bank has and may exercise all other rights and remedies available by law, statute, agreement or in equity. 

Cumulative Remedies. 

The remedies of the Bank under this Note are cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued singularly, successively or together, at the sole discretion of the Bank, and may be exercised as often as occasion therefor may arise. No act of omission or commission of the Bank, including specifically any failure to exercise any right, remedy or recourse, shall be deemed to be a waiver or release of the same, such waiver or release to be effected only through a written instrument executed by the Bank, and then only to the extent specifically recited therein. A waiver or release with reference to any one event shall not be construed as continuing, as a bar to, or as a waiver or release of, any subsequent right, remedy or recourse as to any subsequent event. 

Attorney’s Fees. 

Should it become necessary to collect this Note through an attorney, Borrower shall pay all costs incurred by or accruing to the Bank in making such collection, including a reasonable attorney’s fee. Reasonable attorney’s fees shall include, without limitation, all fees incurred in all matters of collection and enforcement, construction and interpretation, before, during and after trial proceedings and appeals, as well as appearances in, and connected with, any bankruptcy proceeding or creditors’ reorganization or similar proceeding. 

Waivers.

This Note shall bind Borrower and its successors and assigns, and the benefits of this Note shall inure to the benefit of the Bank and its successors and assigns, including any holder of this Note. All references in this Note to Borrower or the Bank include their respective successors and assigns.

The validity, construction, enforcement and interpretation of this Note shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of Florida, without application of its conflicts of law principles, and the United States of America. Any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Note shall be brought in the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Hillsborough County, Florida, or in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, [[Address 3: Address]], and the Bank and Borrower irrevocably consent to and submit to the jurisdiction of those courts, and irrevocably waive any objection which the Bank and Borrower, respectively, now or hereafter may have to the institution of any such suit, action, or proceeding in those courts, and further irrevocably waive any defense or claim that such suit, action or proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum or improper venue.
