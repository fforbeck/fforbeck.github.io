If a limitation of the number of Registrable Securities is required pursuant to this Section 2.4, the number of Registrable Securities that may be included in the underwriting by selling Holders shall be allocated among such Holders, in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of Registrable Securities which the Holders would otherwise be entitled to include in the Registration; provided, however, that the number of shares of Registrable Securities to be included in such underwriting and registration shall not be reduced unless all other securities are first entirely excluded from the underwriting and registration including all shares that are not Registrable Securities and are held by any other Person, including any Person who is an employee, officer or director of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company; provided further, at least [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of shares of Registrable Securities requested by the Holders to be included in such underwriting and registration shall be so included.

*[Investors’ Rights Agreement]* 

^^Underwriting Requirements. 

^^In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of the Company’s Equity Securities, the Company shall not be required to Register the Registrable Securities of a Holder under this Section 3 unless such Holder’s Registrable Securities are included in the underwriting and such Holder enters into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriters selected by the Company and setting forth such terms for the underwriting as have been agreed upon between the Company and the underwriters. In the event the underwriters advise Holders seeking Registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 3 in writing that the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without being likely to have a significant adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the class of securities offered or the market for the class of securities offered, then the underwriters may exclude some or all Registrable Securities from the Registration and underwriting after excluding any other Equity Securities (including, without limitation, all Equity Securities that are not Registrable Securities and held by persons other than Holders) from the underwriting, and the number of Equity Securities and Registrable Securities that may be included in the Registration and the underwriting shall be allocated (i) first, to the Company, (ii) second, among the Holders requesting inclusion of their Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of Registrable Securities which the Holders would otherwise be entitled to include in the Registration and (iii) third, to any other shareholder other than a Holder on a pro rata basis; provided, that, in the event of any offering other than an IPO, the right of the underwriter to exclude any Registrable Securities from the Registration and underwriting as described above shall be restricted such that the Registrable Securities requested to be included by the Holders may not be reduced below twenty percent ([[Percentage 4: Number]]%) of the Ordinary Shares to be included in the Registration and underwriting, as determined on a Fully-Diluted basis, and in no event shall participation in the Registration by a shareholder other than a Holder exclude a Holder from the Registration. 

^^If any Holder disapproves of the terms of any underwriting, such Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the underwriters delivered at least ten (10) days prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement. Any Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from the underwriting shall be withdrawn from the Registration. 

^^Exempt Transactions. The Company shall have no obligation to Register any Registrable Securities under this Section 3 in connection with a Registration by the Company (i) relating solely to the sale of securities to participants in a Company equity incentive plan, or (ii) relating to a corporate reorganization or other transaction under Rule 145 of the Securities Act (or comparable provision under the laws of another jurisdiction, as applicable) or (iii) a registration on Form S-8 or any successor form to such form. 

^Procedures. 

^^Registration Procedures and Obligations. Whenever required under this Agreement to effect the Registration of any Registrable Securities held by the Holders, the Company shall, as expeditiously as possible: 

^^Prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement with respect to those Registrable Securities and use its reasonable best efforts to cause that Registration Statement to become effective, and, upon the request of the Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities Registered thereunder, keep the Registration Statement effective for a period of up to 180 days or, if earlier, until the distribution contemplated in the Registration Statement has been completed; provided however, that the Company shall not be deemed to have kept the Registration Statement effective if the Company voluntarily takes any action or omits to take any action that would result in the inability of any Holder of Registered Securities covered by such Registration Statement to be able to offer and sell any such Registered Securities during the effectiveness of such Registration Statement, unless such action or omission is required by Applicable Law. 

*[Investors’ Rights Agreement]* 

^^Prepare and file with the Commission amendments and supplements to that Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with the Registration Statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of Applicable Securities Law with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by the Registration Statement, or as reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities held by the participating Holders;

^^In the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form (including usual and customary provisions with respect to indemnification), with the managing underwriters of the offering.

^^Upon the occurrence of any event described in Section 4.1(f) above, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the applicable registration statement or related prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the Holders of the securities being sold thereunder, such prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;

^^Promptly notify the Holders, and confirm such advice in writing (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to a registration statement or related prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any of the registered securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and (v) of the Company’s reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to a registration statement would be appropriate; 

^^Use reasonable best efforts to comply in all material respects with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC in connection with a registration pursuant hereto, and make generally available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable (but not more than 15 months) after the effective date of the applicable registration statement, an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11.1 (a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;

^^Registration Expenses. All expenses, other than Selling Expenses (and underwriting, brokerage or similar commissions, compensation, discounts or concessions payable by the selling Holders in connection with the sale of Registrable Securities), incurred in connection with Registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to this Agreement, including (without limitation) all Registration, filing and qualification fees, printers’ and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company, shall be borne by the Company.

*[Investors’ Rights Agreement]* 

^Indemnification. 

^^Company Indemnity. 

^^To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, such Holder’s officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, legal counsel and accountants, and each Person, if any, who controls (as defined in the Securities Act) such Holder against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under laws which are applicable to the Company and relate to action or inaction required of the Company in connection with any Registration, qualification, or compliance, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (each a “**Violation**”): 

^^^any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Registration Statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus or any “free writing prospectus” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) used in connection with the sale of any Registrable Securities contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, 

^^^the omission or alleged omission to slate in the Registration Statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or 

^^^any violation or alleged violation by the Company of Applicable Securities Laws, or any rule or regulation promulgated under Applicable Securities Laws. The Company will reimburse each such Holder or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. 

^^The indemnity agreement contained in this Section 5.1 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation that occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such Registration by any such Holder, underwriter or controlling person. 

^^This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Holder or any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Holder. 

^^Holder Indemnity. 

^^To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, legal counsel and accountants, any other Holder selling securities in connection with such Registration and each Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act) the Company, such other Holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under Applicable Securities Laws, or any rule or regulation promulgated under Applicable Securities Laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder expressly for use such registration statement; and each such Holder will reimburse any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.2, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability such Holder may otherwise have and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Holder. 

*[Investors’ Rights Agreement]* 

^^The indemnity contained in this Section 5.2 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and in no event shall any indemnity under this Section 5.2 exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder. 

^^Notice of Indemnification Claim. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under Section 5.1 or Section 5.2, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying parties. An indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the reasonably incurred fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time after the commencement of any such action, if the indemnifying party is prejudiced as a result thereof, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 5, but the omission to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability (except to the extent it is prejudiced by such omission) that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 5. 

^^Contribution. If any indemnification provided for in Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not lake account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), (A) no Holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds to such Holder from the sale of all such Registrable Securities offered and sold by such Holder pursuant to such Registration Statement; and (B) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

^^Survival. The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 5 shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement under this Agreement, and otherwise. 

^Additional Undertakings. 

^^Reports under the Exchange Act. With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and any comparable provision of any Applicable Securities Law that may at any time permit a Holder to sell securities of the Company to the public without Registration or pursuant to a Registration on Form F-3 or Form S-3 (or any comparable form in a jurisdiction other than the United States), the Company agrees to: 

^^Make and keep publicly available information so long as necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all times after the effective date of the first registration under the Securities Act filed by the Company for an offering of its securities to the genera! public (provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to make an Adverse Disclosure); 

*[Investors’ Rights Agreement]* 

^^file with or submit to the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under all Applicable Securities Laws; and 

^^at any time following sixty (60) days after the effective date of an IPO by the Company, promptly furnish to any Holder holding Registrable Securities, upon written request (i) a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of all Applicable Securities Laws at any lime after it has become subject to such reporting requirements or, at any time after so qualified, that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to Form F-3 or Form S-3 (or any form comparable thereto under Applicable Securities Laws of any jurisdiction where the Company’s securities are listed), (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents as have been filed by the Company with the Commission, and (iii) such other information, or take any action, as may be reasonably requested in availing any Holder of any rule or regulation of the Commission, that permits the selling of any such securities without Registration or pursuant to Form F-3 or Form S-3 (or any form comparable thereto under Applicable Securities Laws of any jurisdiction where the Company’s Securities are listed). 

^^Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall not enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any Equity Securities of the Company that would grant such holder or prospective holder any registration rights superior to or in parity with those rights granted pursuant to this Agreement. 

^^Termination of Registration Rights. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the registration rights set forth in Section 2 and Section 3 of this Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) when, with respect to any Holder, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, all such Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by such Holder may then be sold without Registration in any ninety (90) day period pursuant to Rule 144 (k) promulgated under the Securities Act, which counsel and opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to such Holder, or (ii) the date as of which all of the Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to a Registration Statement. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company obtains from the Commission a “no-action” letter in which the Commission indicated that it will take no action if, without Registration under the Securities Act or other Applicable Securities Laws, any Holder disposes of Registrable Securities covered by any request for Registration made under this Agreement in the specific manner in which the Holder proposes to dispose of Registrable Securities included in that request (including, without limitation, inclusion of the Registrable Securities in an underwriting initialed by either the Company or the Holders) and that the Registrable Securities may be sold to the public without Registration, then the Registrable Securities included in the request for Registration, shall not be eligible for Registration under Section 2 and Section 3 with respect to the proposed disposition. Any Registrable Securities not so disposed of shall be eligible for Registration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement with respect to other proposed dispositions to which this Section 6.3 does not apply. 

*[Investors’ Rights Agreement]* 

^^Assignment of Registration Rights. The right to cause the Company to Register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement may be assigned by any Holder to a transferee or assignee of such securities, provided that: (a) the Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights arc being assigned; (b) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (c) such assignee acquires Registrable Securities with an estimated aggregate value of US$[[USD Value 7: Number]] million or more. 

^^Market Stand-off. Each of the Holders agrees that, so long as it holds any voting securities of the Company, upon request by the underwriters managing the IPO of the Company’s securities, it will enter into a customary form of lock-up or similar agreement with such managing underwriter with a term commencing from the effective date of the registration statement covering such IPO or the pricing date of such offering as may be requested by the underwriters. The term of such lock up arrangement shall in no event exceed 180 days. The foregoing agreement shall not apply in the case of the sale of any securities of the Company to an underwriter pursuant to any underwriting agreement or any offering after the IPO, and shall only be applicable to the Holders if the Company and all officers, directors and holders of one percent ([[Percentage 5: Number]]%) or more of the Company’s outstanding share capital enter into similar agreements, and if the Company or any underwriter releases any officer, director or holder of one percent ([[Percentage 5]]%) or more of the Company’s outstanding share capital from his, her or its sale restrictions so undertaken, then each Holder shall be notified prior to such release and shall itself be simultaneously released to the same proportional extent. This Section 6.5 shall not apply to the sale of Equity Securities by the Company (A) in connection with registrations on Form F-4 or S-8 or any successor or similar forms thereto, (B) in connection with registrations for the offer and sale to employees pursuant to any employee stock plan or other employee benefit plan arrangement as unanimously approved by the Board of Directors and (C) of securities to be issued solely in an acquisition or business combination. The Company shall require all future acquirers of one percent ([[Percentage 5]]%) or more of the Company’s Equity Securities prior to an IPO to execute a market stand-off agreement containing substantially similar provisions as those contained in this Section 6.5. 

^Preemptive Rights 

^^Restrictions. The Company shall not issue any New Securities of any type or class to any Person (the “**Proposed Recipient**”) unless the Company has offered each Ordinary Shareholder and Holder (each Ordinary Shareholder and Holder, for purposes of this Section 7, a “**Preemptive Right holder**”) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7, the right to purchase such Preemptive Rightholder’s Pro Rata Share of such issuance (“**Preemptive Rights**”) and the right to oversubscribe if any other Preemptive Rightholder elects not to purchase its Pro Rata Share of such securities (“**Oversubscription Rights**”) for a per unit consideration, payable solely in cash, equal to the per unit consideration to be paid by the Proposed Recipient and otherwise on the same terms and conditions as are offered to the Proposed Recipient. The securities that have not been purchased by the Preemptive Rightholders who fail to exercise their Preemptive Rights or fail to complete the purchase of their Pro Rata Shares shall first be offered to the Preemptive Rightholders who have exercised their Oversubscription Rights within the Issuance Notice Period pro rata to the number of additional securities that such Preemptive Rightholders have agreed to lake up above their respective Pro Rata Share; provided that no Preemptive Rightholder shall be obliged to purchase more securities above its Pro Rata Share than such additional securities it indicates its agreement to take up under this Section 7.1. 

^^Notice. Not less than fifteen (15) days before a proposed issuance of securities other than in connection with an issuance not subject to Section 7.1 (a “**Proposed Issuance**”), the Company shall deliver to each Preemptive Rightholder written notice (the “**Issuance Notice**”) of the Proposed Issuance setting forth (a) the number, type and terms of the securities to be issued, (b) the consideration to be received by the Company in connection with the Proposed Issuance and (c) the identity of the Proposed Recipients. 

*[Investors’ Rights Agreement]* 

^^Exercise of Rights.

Except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, failure by any Preemptive Rightholder to give such notice within the Issuance Notice Period shall be deemed a waiver by such Preemptive Rightholder of its rights under this Section 7 with respect to such Proposed Issuance. If any Preemptive Rightholder fails to give the notice required under this Section 7.3 solely because of the Company’s failure to comply with the notice provisions of Section 7.2, then the Company shall not issue securities pursuant to this Section 7 and if any securities are purported to be issued, such issuance of securities shall be void. 

^^Sales by the Company. For a period of sixty (60) days following the expiration of the twenty-five (25) day period described in Section 7.3 above, the Company may issue the securities with respect to which the Preemptive Rights under this Section 7 were not exercised, at a price and upon terms not more favorable to the Proposed Recipient thereof than specified in the Issuance Notice. In the event the Company has not completed the sale of such securities to the Proposed Recipient within such sixty (60) day period, the Company shall not thereafter issue or sell any securities without first again offering such securities to the Preemptive Rightholders in the manner provided in Section 7.1 above. 

^^Termination of Preemptive Rights. The Preemptive Rights provided in this Section 7 shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the closing of a Qualified Public Offering, (ii) a Liquidation Event or (iii) such time as the Investors collectively own less than [[Percentage 4]]% of the Series A Shares (or the Conversion Shares issued upon the conversion of such Series A Shares) purchased by the Investors at the Closing.

The Company shall also and the Founders, the Trust and the BVI Entities shall cause the Company to, reasonably promptly upon written request, the expenses and costs in connection with which shall be borne [[Percentage 1]]% by the Company and [[Percentage 1]]% by the Investors (expenses so shared shall be referred to as “**Shared Expenses**”) obtain and provide any and all other information reasonably deemed necessary by such Investor to comply with the provisions of this Section 8.5(a).

^^^If the Transferor and the Exercising Offerees cannot agree on such cash value within seven (7) days after the dale on which the Exercising Offerees notify the Transferor of the exercise of their right of first refusal pursuant to Section 11.2(b)(ii), the valuation shall be made by an appraiser of recognized standing selected by the Transferor and the Exercising Offerees or, if they cannot agree on an appraiser within fourteen (14) days after the Exercising Offerees notify the Transferor of the exercise of their right of first refusal pursuant to Section 11.2(b)(ii), each of the Transferor and the Exercising Offeree shall select an appraiser of recognized standing and the two (2) appraisers shall designate a third appraiser of recognized standing, whose appraisal shall be determinative of such value. 

^^^The cost of such appraisal shall be shared equally by the Transferor and the Exercising Offerees, with the half of the cost borne by the Exercising Offerees to be borne pro rata by each based on the number of shares each Exercising Offeree has elected to purchase pursuant to this Section 11. 

^^^If the value of the purchase price offered by the prospective transferee is not determined within the forty-five (45) day period specified in Section 11.2(b)(v) above, the closing of the Exercising Offerees’ purchase of the Offered Shares shall be held on or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day after such valuation shall have been made pursuant to this Section 11.2(c).

^^^Such Selling Holder’s notice to the Transferor shall indicate the number of Equity Securities the Selling Holder wishes to sell under its right to participate. 

^^^To the extent one (1) or more of the Holders exercise such right of participation in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below, the number of Equity Securities that the Transferor may sell in the Transfer shall be correspondingly reduced. 

^^Each Selling Holder may elect to sell up to such number of Equity Securities equal to (on a fully converted basis) the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of the Offered Shares being transferred following the exercise or expiration of all rights of first refusal pursuant to Section 11.2 by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Ordinary Share Equivalents held by the Selling Holder on the date of the Transfer Notice, and the denominator of which is the total number of Ordinary Shares Equivalents held by the Transferor and all Selling Holders on the date of the Transfer Notice. 

^^Each Selling Holder shall reasonably cooperate with the Transferor in connection with the transfer of its Equity Securities to the prospective purchaser. If the prospective third-party purchaser objects to the delivery of Equity Securities in lieu of Ordinary Shares, such Selling Holder shall convert, such Equity Securities into Ordinary Shares and deliver certificates corresponding to such Ordinary Shares. The Company agrees to make any such conversion concurrent with the actual transfer of such shares to the purchaser and contingent on such transfer. 

*[Investors’ Rights Agreement]* 

^^To the extent that any prospective purchaser prohibits the participation of a Selling Holder exercising its co-sale rights hereunder in a proposed Transfer or otherwise refuses to purchase shares or other securities from a Selling Holder exercising its co-sale rights hereunder, the Transferor shall not sell to such prospective purchaser any Equity Securities unless and until, simultaneously with such sale, the Transferor shall purchase such Equity Securities from such Selling Holder for the same consideration and on the same terms and conditions as the proposed transfer described in the Transfer Notice.

Within three (3) Business Days after entering into any agreement to sell Offered Shares to a third party under this Section, the Transferor shall furnish each Offeree with a copy of all agreements relating to such sale. 

^^In the event the Transferor does not consummate the sale or disposition of the Offered Shares within sixty (60) days after the expiration of such rights, the Offerees’ first refusal rights and co-sale rights (if applicable) shall continue to be applicable to any subsequent disposition of the Offered Shares by the Transferor until such rights lapse in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

^^The exercise or non-exercise of the rights of the Offerees under this Section 11.4 to purchase Equity Securities from a Transferor or, if applicable, participate in the sale of Equity Securities by a Transferor shall not adversely affect their rights to make subsequent purchases from a Transferor of Equity Securities or subsequently participate in sales of Equity Securities by a Transferor hereunder.

If, as a result of any transaction, any officer or any other employee of the Company proposes to acquire shares which, together with any shares already owned by such officer or employee, would represent five percent ([[Percentage 6]]%) or more of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares on a fully-diluted basis, it shall be a condition precedent to such acquisition that such officer or employee shall, and the Company, and the Founders and each of the BVI Entities shall, cause such officer or employee to execute and deliver to the Investors a letter agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which such officer or employee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement as a Founder. 

^^Avoidance of Restrictions. The Parties agree that the transfer restrictions in this Agreement shall not be capable of being avoided by the holding of Equity Securities indirectly through a company or other entity that can itself be sold in order to dispose of any interest in Equity Securities free of such restrictions. Any Transfer of any shares (or other interest) of any such company or entity controlled by or directly or indirectly owned by a Founder shall (unless otherwise provided in Section 11.6 of this Agreement) be treated as a Transfer of Equity Securities held by such Founder, and the provisions of this Agreement that apply in respect of the Transfer of Equity Securities shall apply in respect of such Transfer of interests in such company or entity. 

^^Dispute Resolution. 

^^The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute, controversy or difference between them arising out of, in connection with or relating to, this Agreement (any such dispute, controversy or difference, a “**Dispute**”), and for such purpose shall nominate one senior officer of the rank of Vice President or higher as its representative. These representatives shall, within fifteen (15) days of a written request by either Party to call such a meeting, meet in person and alone (except for one assistant for each Party) and shall attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute cannot be resolved by such senior managers within thirty (30) days of the written meeting request, either Party may thereafter submit the Dispute for arbitration in accordance with Section 18.12(b) below. 

*[Investors’ Rights Agreement]* 

^^Any dispute not resolved under Section 18.12(a) shall be resolved through arbitration pursuant to this Section 18.12(b). The arbitration shall be conducted in Hong Kong under the auspices of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (the “**Centre**”) in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules in effect at the time of the arbitration. There shall be three arbitrators. Each of the following: (i) the claimant to the Dispute, or in the case of multiple claimants, all such claimants acting collectively (the “**Claimant**”), and (ii) the respondent to the Dispute, or in the case of more than one respondent, the respondents acting collectively (the “**Respondent**”), shall select one arbitrator. The party commencing the arbitration shall nominate his arbitrator at the time of filing the demand for arbitration. The respondent shall nominate his arbitrator within thirty (30) days after receiving the demand for arbitration. Such arbitrators shall be freely selected, and neither the Claimant nor the Respondent shall be limited in their selection to any prescribed list. The Centre shall select the third arbitrator. Each arbitrator shall be qualified to practice law in New York. If either party docs not appoint an arbitrator who has consented to participate within the time set forth above, the relevant appointment shall be made by the Centre. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. If the UNCITRAL Rules are in conflict with the provisions of this Section 18.12(b) including the provisions concerning the appointment of arbitrators, the provisions of this Section 18.12(b) shall prevail. The arbitration tribunal shall decide any dispute submitted by the Parties to the arbitration strictly in accordance with the substantive law of New York and shall not apply any other substantive law. In making their award, the arbitrators shall have the authority to award attorney’s fees and other costs and expenses of the arbitration as they deem just and appropriate under the circumstances. Each Party hereto shall cooperate with the others in making full disclosure of and providing complete access to all information and documents requested by the others in connection with such arbitration proceedings, subject only to any attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege and confidentiality obligations binding on such Party. The award shall be issued within six (6) months of the constitution of the arbitration tribunal, provided, however, that the arbitration tribunal shall, upon a finding that it is impracticable to meet such deadline consistent with its primary obligation justly to determine the controversy before it, have discretion to extend or alter such deadline to the extent necessary to prevent injustice or preserve the enforceability of its award. The award of the arbitration tribunal shall be final and binding upon the disputing Parties, and any Party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement of such award. The Parties shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably required to facilitate the prompt enforcement in the PRC or in any other jurisdiction of any arbitration award made by the tribunal. A Party shall be entitled to seek preliminary injunctive relief, if possible, from any court of competent jurisdiction pending the constitution of the arbitral tribunal.
