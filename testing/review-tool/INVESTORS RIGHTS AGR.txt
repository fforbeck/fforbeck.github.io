^In connection with the sale and issuance of the Cano Series D Preferred Shares, Cano and the purchasers of Cano Series D Preferred Shares at such time entered into that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated [[Date 3: Date]] (the "***Securities Purchase Agreement***") and that certain Registration Rights Agreement, dated [[Date 3]], with Cano (the "***Registration Rights Agreement***"), both of which provided certain rights to the holders of Cano Series D Preferred Shares.

^*Registration.* 

^^*Mandatory Registration.* The Company shall prepare, and, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the Filing Deadline, file with the SEC the Registration Statement on Form S-1 covering the resale of all of the Registrable Securities. The Registration Statement prepared pursuant hereto shall register for resale at least the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Registration Amount determined as of the date the Registration Statement is initially filed with the SEC. The Registration Statement shall contain (except if otherwise directed by the Required Holders) the "*Selling Shareholders*" and "*Plan of Distribution*" sections in substantially the form attached hereto as *Exhibit B*. The Company shall use its best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the Effectiveness Deadline. By 9:30 am on the second Business Day following the Effective Date, the Company shall file with the SEC in accordance with Rule 424 under the 1933 Act the final prospectus to be used in connection with sales pursuant to such Registration Statement. 

^^*Allocation of Registrable Securities.* The initial number of Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement and any increase in the number of Registrable Securities included therein shall be allocated pro rata among the Investors based on the number of Registrable Securities held by each Investor at the time the Registration Statement covering such initial number of Registrable Securities or increase thereof is declared effective by the SEC. In the event that an Investor sells or otherwise transfers any of such Investor's Registrable Securities, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the then remaining number of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement for such transferor. Any shares of Common Stock included in a Registration Statement and which remain allocated to any Person who ceases to hold any Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement shall be allocated to the remaining Investors, pro rata based on the number of Registrable Securities then held by such Investors which are covered by such Registration Statement. 

^^*Legal Counsel.* Subject to Section 5 hereof, the Required Holders shall have the right to select one legal counsel to review and oversee any registration pursuant to this Section 2 ("***Legal Counsel***"), which legal counsel shall be designated in writing to the Company by the Required Holders. The Company and Legal Counsel shall reasonably cooperate with each other in performing the Company's obligations under this Agreement. 

^^*Ineligibility for Form S-3.* In the event that Form S-3 is not available for the registration of the resale of Registrable Securities hereunder, the Company shall (i) register the resale of the Registrable Securities on another appropriate form reasonably acceptable to the Required Holders and (ii) undertake to register the Registrable Securities on Form S-3 as soon as such form is available, provided that the Company shall maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement then in effect until such time as a Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the Registrable Securities has been declared effective by the SEC. 

^^*Sufficient Number of Shares Registered.* In the event the number of shares available under a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2(a) is insufficient to cover all of the Registrable Securities required to be covered by such Registration Statement or an Investor's allocated portion of the Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2(b), the Company shall amend the applicable Registration Statement, or file a new Registration Statement (on the short form available therefor, if applicable), or both, so as to cover at least the Required Registration Amount as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of the filing of such amendment or new Registration Statement, in each case, as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than fifteen (15) days after the necessity therefor arises. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause such amendment and/or new Registration Statement to become effective as soon as practicable following the filing thereof. For purposes of the foregoing provision, the number of shares available under a Registration Statement shall be deemed "insufficient to cover all of the Registrable Securities" if at any time the number of shares of Common Stock available for resale under the Registration Statement is less than the product determined by multiplying (i) the Required Registration Amount as of such time by (ii) 0.90. The calculation set forth in the foregoing sentence shall be made without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares and such calculation shall assume that the Series A Preferred Shares are then convertible into shares of Common Stock at the then prevailing Conversion Rate (as defined in the Certificate of Designations). 

^^*Effect of Failure to File and Obtain and Maintain Effectiveness of Registration Statement.* If (i) a Registration Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities required to be covered thereby and required to be filed by the Company pursuant to this Agreement is (A) not filed with the SEC on or before the respective Filing Deadline (a "***Filing Failure***") or (B) not declared effective by the SEC on or before the respective Effectiveness Deadline (an "***Effectiveness Failure***") or (ii) on any day after the Effective Date sales of all of the Registrable Securities required to be included on such Registration Statement cannot be made (other than during an Allowable Grace Period (as defined in Section 3(r)) pursuant to such Registration Statement (including, without limitation, because of a failure to keep such Registration Statement effective, to disclose such information as is necessary for sales to be made pursuant to such Registration Statement, to register a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock or to maintain a listing of the Common Stock) (a "***Maintenance Failure***") then, as partial relief for the damages to any holder by reason of any such delay in or reduction of its ability to sell the underlying shares of Common Stock and not as a penalty (which remedy shall not be exclusive of any other remedies available at law or in equity), the Company shall pay to each holder of Registrable Securities relating to such Registration Statement an amount in cash equal to one and one-half percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the aggregate Purchase Price of such Investor's Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement on each of the following dates: (i) the day of a Filing Failure; (ii) the day of an Effectiveness Failure; (iii) the initial day of a Maintenance Failure; (iv) on every thirtieth day after the day of a Filing Failure and thereafter (pro rated for periods totaling less than thirty days) until such Filing Failure is cured; (v) on every thirtieth day after the day of an Effectiveness Failure and thereafter (pro rated for periods totaling less than thirty days) until such Effectiveness Failure is cured; and (vi) on every thirtieth day after the initial day of a Maintenance Failure and thereafter (pro rated for periods totaling less than thirty days) until such Maintenance Failure is cured. The payments to which a holder shall be entitled pursuant to this Section 2(f) are referred to herein as "***Registration Delay Payments***." Registration Delay Payments shall be paid on the earlier of (I) the dates set forth above and (II) the third Business Day after the event or failure giving rise to the Registration Delay Payments is cured. In the event the Company fails to make Registration Delay Payments in a timely manner, such Registration Delay Payments shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent ([[Percentage 2]]%) per month (prorated for partial months) until paid in full. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary in no event shall the aggregate amount of Registration Delay Payments (other than Registration Delay Payments payable pursuant to events that are within the control of the Company) exceed, in the aggregate, [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the aggregate Purchase Price. 

^*Related Obligations.* 

At such time as the Company is obligated to file a Registration Statement with the SEC pursuant to Section 2(a), 2(d) or 2(e), the Company will use its best efforts to effect the registration of the 

Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof and, pursuant thereto, the Company shall have the following obligations: 

^^The Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect to the Registrable Securities and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement relating to the Registrable Securities to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing (but in no event later than the Effectiveness Deadline). The Company shall keep each Registration Statement effective pursuant to Rule 415 at all times until the earlier of (i) the date as of which the Investors may sell all of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement without restriction pursuant to Rule 144(b) (or any successor thereto) promulgated under the 1933 Act or (ii) the date on which the Investors shall have sold all of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement (the "***Registration Period***"). The Company shall ensure that each Registration Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of prospectuses, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made) not misleading. The term "***reasonable best efforts***" shall mean, among other things, that the Company shall submit to the SEC, within three (3) Business Days after the later of the date that (i) the Company learns that no review of a particular Registration Statement will be made by the staff of the SEC or that the staff has no further comments on a particular Registration Statement, as the case may be, and (ii) the approval of Legal Counsel pursuant to Section 3(c) (which approval is immediately sought and shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), a request for acceleration of effectiveness of such Registration Statement to a time and date not later than forty-eight (48) hours after the submission of such request. 

^^The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to a Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with such Registration Statement, which prospectus is to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated under the 1933 Act, as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective at all times during the Registration Period, and, during such period, comply with the provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities of the Company covered by such Registration Statement until such time as all of such Registrable Securities shall have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof as set forth in such Registration Statement. In the case of amendments and supplements to a Registration Statement which are required to be filed pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to this Section 3(b)) by reason of the Company filing a report on Form 10-Q, Form 10-K or any analogous report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "***1934 Act***"), the Company shall have incorporated such report by reference into such Registration Statement, if applicable, or shall file such amendments or supplements with the SEC within one (1) Business Day after the day on which the 1934 Act report is filed which created the requirement for the Company to amend or supplement such Registration Statement. 

^^The Company shall (A) permit Legal Counsel to review and comment upon (i) a Registration Statement at least five (5) Business Days prior to its filing with the SEC and (ii) all amendments and supplements to all Registration Statements (except for Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any similar or successor reports) within a reasonable number of days prior to their filing with the SEC, and (B) not file any Registration Statement or amendment or supplement thereto in a form to which Legal Counsel reasonably objects. The Company shall not submit a request for acceleration of the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto without the prior approval of Legal Counsel, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company shall furnish to Legal Counsel, without charge, (i) copies of any correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the Company or its representatives relating to any Registration Statement, (ii) promptly after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC, one copy of any Registration Statement and any amendment(s) thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference, if requested by an Investor, and all exhibits and (iii) upon the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, one copy of the prospectus included in such Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Legal Counsel in performing the Company's obligations pursuant to this Section 3. 

^^The Company shall furnish to each Investor whose Registrable Securities are included in any Registration Statement, without charge, (i) promptly after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC, at least one copy of such Registration Statement and any amendment(s) thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference, and, if requested by an Investor, all exhibits and each preliminary prospectus, (ii) upon the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, ten (10) copies of the prospectus included in such Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto (or such other number of copies as such Investor may reasonably request) and (iii) such other documents, including copies of any preliminary or final prospectus, as such Investor may reasonably request from time to time in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Investor. 

^^The Company shall use its best efforts to (i) register and qualify, unless an exemption from registration and qualification applies, the resale by Investors of the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of all applicable jurisdictions in the United States, (ii) prepare and file in those jurisdictions, such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to such registrations and qualifications as may be necessary to maintain the effectiveness thereof during the Registration Period, (iii) take such other actions as may be necessary to maintain such registrations and qualifications in effect at all times during the Registration Period, and (iv) take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to qualify the Registrable Securities for sale in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to (x) qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 3(e), (y) subject itself to general taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (z) file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction. The Company shall promptly notify Legal Counsel and each Investor who holds Registrable Securities of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the registration or qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction in the United States or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. 

^^The Company shall notify Legal Counsel and each Investor in writing of the happening of any event, as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, as a result of which the prospectus included in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided that in no event shall such notice contain any material, nonpublic information), and, subject to Section 3(r), promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement to correct such untrue statement or omission, and deliver ten (10) copies of such supplement or amendment to Legal Counsel and each Investor (or such other number of copies as Legal Counsel or such Investor may reasonably request). The Company shall also promptly notify Legal Counsel and each Investor in writing (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and when a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment has become effective (notification of such effectiveness shall be delivered to Legal Counsel and each Investor by facsimile or e-mail on the same day of such effectiveness and by overnight mail), (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or related prospectus or related information, and (iii) of the Company's reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate. 

^^The Company shall use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or the suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an order or suspension is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of such order or suspension at the earliest possible moment and to notify Legal Counsel and each Investor who holds Registrable Securities being sold of the issuance of such order and the resolution thereof or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose. 

^^If any Investor is deemed to be, alleged to be or reasonably believes it may be deemed or alleged to be, an underwriter or is required under applicable securities laws to be described in the Registration Statement as an underwriter, at the reasonable request of such Investor, the Company shall furnish to such Investor, on the date of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and thereafter from time to time on such dates as an Investor may reasonably request (i) a letter, dated such date, from the Company's independent certified public accountants in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the Investors, and (ii) an opinion, dated as of such date, of counsel representing the Company for purposes of such Registration Statement, in form, scope and substance as is customarily given in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the Investors. 

^^Upon the written request of any Investor in connection with such Investor's due diligence requirements, if any, the Company shall make available for inspection by (i) any Investor, (ii) Legal Counsel and (iii) one firm of accountants or other agents retained by the Investors (collectively, the "***Inspectors***"), all pertinent financial and other records, and pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company (collectively, the "***Records***"), as shall be reasonably deemed necessary by each Inspector, and cause the Company's officers, directors and employees, counsel and the Company's independent certified public accountants to supply all information which may be necessary and any Inspector may reasonably request; provided, however, that each Inspector shall agree to hold in strict confidence and shall not make any disclosure (except to an Investor) or use of any Record or other information which the Company determines in good faith to be confidential, and of which determination the Inspectors are so notified, unless (a) the disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in any Registration Statement or is otherwise required under the 1933 Act, (b) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a final, non-appealable subpoena or order from a court or government body of competent jurisdiction, or (c) the information in such Records has been made generally available to the public other than by disclosure in violation of this Agreement. Each Investor agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in or by a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt notice to the Company and allow the Company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain a protective order for, the Records deemed confidential. Nothing herein (or in any other confidentiality agreement between the Company and any Investor) shall be deemed to limit the Investors' ability to sell Registrable Securities in a manner which is otherwise consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

^^The Company shall use its best efforts either to (i) cause all of the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which securities of the same class or series issued by the Company are then listed, if any, if the listing of such Registrable Securities is then permitted under the rules of such exchange or (ii) secure the inclusion for quotation of all of the Registrable Securities on The NASDAQ Global Market or The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or (iii) if, despite the Company's best efforts, the Company is unsuccessful in satisfying the preceding clauses (i) or (ii), to secure the inclusion for quotation on The NASDAQ Capital Market for such Registrable Securities and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to use its best efforts to arrange for at least two market makers to register with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority as such with respect to such Registrable Securities. The Company shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with satisfying its obligation under this Section 3(k).

^^If requested by an Investor, the Company shall as soon as practicable but in no event later than five (5) days after the receipt of notice from such Investor, (i) incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as an Investor reasonably requests to be included therein relating to the sale and distribution of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the number of Registrable Securities being offered or sold, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering; (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment after being notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; and (iii) supplement or make amendments to any Registration Statement if reasonably requested by an Investor holding any Registrable Securities.

^^The Company shall otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC in connection with any registration hereunder. 

^^Within two (2) Business Days after a Registration Statement which covers Registrable Securities is ordered effective by the SEC, the Company shall deliver, and shall cause legal counsel for the Company to deliver, to the transfer agent for such Registrable Securities (with copies to the Investors whose Registrable Securities are included in such Registration Statement) confirmation that such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC in the form attached hereto as *Exhibit C*. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time after the Effective Date, the Company may delay the disclosure of material, non-public information concerning the Company the disclosure of which at the time is not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company and its counsel, in the best interest of the Company and, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, otherwise required (a "***Grace Period***"); provided, that the Company shall promptly (i) notify the Investors in writing of the existence of material, non-public information giving rise to a Grace Period (provided that in each notice the Company will not disclose the content of such material, non-public information to the Investors) and the date on which the Grace Period will begin, and (ii) notify the Investors in writing of the date on which the Grace Period ends; and, provided further, that no Grace Period shall exceed twelve (12) consecutive days and during any three hundred sixty-five (365) day period such Grace Periods shall not exceed an aggregate of twenty-five (25) days and the first day of any Grace Period must be at least five (5) trading days after the last day of any prior Grace Period (each, an "***Allowable Grace Period***").

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to a transferee of an Investor in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which an Investor has entered into a contract for sale, and delivered a copy of the prospectus included as part of the applicable Registration Statement (unless an exemption from such delivery requirement exists), prior to the Investor's receipt of the notice of a Grace Period and for which the Investor has not yet settled. 

^*Obligations of the Investors*. 

^^At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the first anticipated filing date of a Registration Statement, the Company shall notify each Investor in writing of the information the Company requires from each such Investor if such Investor elects to have any of such Investor's Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement.

^^Each Investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(g) or the first sentence of 3(f), such Investor will immediately discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement(s) covering such Registrable Securities until such Investor's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by the first sentence of 3(f) or receipt of notice that no supplement or amendment is required. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to a transferee of an Investor in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which an Investor has entered into a contract for sale prior to the Investor's receipt of a notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(g) or the first sentence of 3(f) and for which the Investor has not yet settled.

In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement under this Agreement: 

^^To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company will, and hereby does, indemnify, hold harmless and defend each Investor, the directors, officers, members, partners, employees, agents, representatives of, and each Person, if any, who controls any Investor within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act (each, an "***Indemnified Person***"), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, charges, costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, amounts paid in settlement or expenses, joint or several, other than consequential, indirect or incidental damages (collectively, "***Claims***") incurred in investigating, preparing or defending any action, claim, suit, inquiry, proceeding, investigation or appeal taken from the foregoing by or before any court or governmental, administrative or other regulatory agency, body or the SEC, whether pending or threatened, whether or not an indemnified party is or may be a party thereto ("***Indemnified Damages***"), to which any of them may become subject insofar as such Claims (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto or in any filing made in connection with the qualification of the offering under the securities or other "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction in which Registrable Securities are offered ("***Blue Sky Filing***"), or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus if used prior to the effective date of such Registration Statement, or contained in the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if the Company files any amendment thereof or supplement thereto with the SEC) or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading, (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, any other law, including, without limitation, any state securities law, or any rule or regulation thereunder relating to the offer or sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement or (iv) any violation of this Agreement (the matters in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) being, collectively, "***Violations***"). Subject to Section 6(c), the Company shall reimburse the Indemnified Persons, promptly as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6(a): (i) shall not apply to a Claim by an Indemnified Person arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such Indemnified Person for such Indemnified Person expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(d) and (ii) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Investors pursuant to Section 9. 

^^In connection with any Registration Statement in which an Investor is participating, each such Investor agrees to severally and not jointly indemnify, hold harmless and defend, to the same extent and in the same manner as is set forth in Section 6(a), the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act (each, an "***Indemnified Party***"), against any Claim or Indemnified Damages to which any of them may become subject, under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claim or Indemnified Damages arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Investor expressly for use in connection with such Registration Statement; and, subject to Section 6(c), such Investor will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6(b) and the agreement with respect to contribution contained in Section 7 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of such Investor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, further, however, that the Investor shall be liable under this Section 6(b) for only that amount of a Claim or Indemnified Damages as does not exceed the net proceeds to such Investor as a result of the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Investors pursuant to Section 9. 

^^Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving a Claim, such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be; provided, however, that an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the fees and expenses of not more than one counsel for such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel retained by the indemnifying party, the representation by such counsel of the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. In the case of an Indemnified Person, legal counsel referred to in the immediately preceding sentence shall be selected by the Investors holding at least a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement to which the Claim relates. The Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person shall cooperate reasonably with the indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or Claim by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person which relates to such action or Claim. The indemnifying party shall keep the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its prior written consent, provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person of a release from all liability in respect to such Claim or litigation, and such settlement shall not include any admission as to fault on the part of the Indemnified Party or the Indemnified Person. Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action. 

^^The indemnification required by this Section 6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or Indemnified Damages are incurred. 

^^The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (i) any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law. 

^*Contribution*. 

To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that: (i) no Person involved in the sale of Registrable Securities which Person is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) in connection with such sale shall be entitled to contribution from any Person involved in such sale of Registrable Securities who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation; and (ii) contribution by any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. 

^*Reports Under the 1934 Act*. 

With a view to making available to the Investors the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act or any other similar rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit the Investors to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration ("***Rule 144***"), the Company agrees to: 

^^make and keep adequate current public information with respect to the Company available, as required by Rule 144; 

^^file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act so long as the Company remains subject to such requirements (it being understood that nothing herein shall limit the Company's obligations under Section 10(a)) and the filing of such reports and other documents is required for the applicable provisions of Rule 144; and 

^^furnish to each Investor so long as such Investor owns Registrable Securities, promptly upon request, (i) a written statement by the Company, if true, that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested to permit the Investors to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without registration. 

^*Assignment of Investor's Rights*. 

The rights under this Agreement shall be automatically assignable by the Investors to any transferee of all or any portion of such Investor's Registrable Securities if: (i) the Investor agrees in writing with the transferee or assignee to assign such rights, and a copy of such agreement is furnished to the Company within a reasonable time after such assignment; (ii) the Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer or assignment, furnished with written notice of (a) the name and address of such transferee or assignee, and (b) the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned; (iii) immediately following such transfer or assignment the further disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is restricted under the 1933 Act or applicable state securities laws; (iv) at or before the time the Company receives the written notice contemplated by clause (ii) of this sentence the transferee or assignee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of the provisions contained herein; and (v) such transfer shall have been made in accordance with other applicable requirements set forth herein. 

^*Additional Covenants*. 

^^*Reporting Status.* Until the date on which the Series A Holders shall have sold all the Conversion Shares and none of the Series A Preferred Shares are outstanding (the "***Reporting Period***"), the Company shall timely file all reports required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act, and the Company shall not terminate its status as an issuer required to file reports under the 1934 Act even if the 1934 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would no longer require or otherwise permit such termination. From the time Form S-3 is available to the Company for the registration of the Conversion Shares, the Company shall take all actions necessary to maintain its eligibility to register the Conversion Shares for resale by the Series A Holders on Form S-3 and at all times the Company shall conduct its business in accordance with applicable law. 

^^*Financial Information.* The Company agrees to send the following to each Investor during the Reporting Period (i) unless the following are filed with the SEC through EDGAR and are available to the public through the EDGAR system, within one (1) Business Day after the filing thereof with the SEC, a copy of its Annual Reports and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K or 10-Q, any interim reports or any consolidated balance sheets, income statements, shareholders' equity statements and/or cash flow statements for any period other than annual, any Current Reports on Form 8-K and any registration statements (other than on Form S-8) or amendments filed pursuant to the 1933 Act and (ii) copies of any notices and other information made available or given to the shareholders of the Company generally, contemporaneously with the making available or giving thereof to the shareholders. 

^^*Listing.* The Company shall promptly secure the listing of all of the Registrable Securities upon each national securities exchange and automated quotation system, if any, upon which the Common Stock is then listed (subject to official notice of issuance). The Company shall maintain the Common Stock's authorization for quotation on the Principal Market or any Eligible Market. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action which would be reasonably expected to result in the delisting or suspension of the Common Stock on the Principal Market. The Company shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with satisfying its obligations under this Section 10(c). 

^^*Pledge of Securities.* The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Securities may be pledged by an Investor in connection with a bona fide margin agreement or other loan or financing arrangement that is secured by the Securities. The pledge of Securities shall not be deemed to be a transfer, sale or assignment of the Securities hereunder, and no Investor effecting a pledge of Securities shall be required to provide the Company with any notice thereof or otherwise make any delivery to the Company pursuant to this Agreement. The Company hereby agrees to execute and deliver such documentation as a pledgee of the Securities may reasonably request in connection with a pledge of the Securities to such pledgee by an Investor. 

^^*Disclosure of Transactions and Other Material Information.* On or before 8:30 a.m., [[Address 3: Address]], on the third Business Day following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall issue a press release and file a Current Report on Form 8-K describing the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement in the form required by the 1934 Act and attaching the Agreement (including, without limitation, all schedules to this Agreement) as an exhibit to such filing (including all attachments, the "***8-K Filing***"). From and after the filing of the 8-K Filing with the SEC, no Investor shall be in possession of any material, nonpublic information received from the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its respective officers, directors, employees or agents, that is not disclosed in the 8-K Filing. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, not to, provide any Investor with any material, nonpublic information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from and after the filing of the 8-K Filing with the SEC without the express written consent of such Investor or as may be required under the terms of this Agreement. If an Investor has, or believes it has, received any such material, nonpublic information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries directly from the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of their affiliates, officers, directors or any other Person acting on their behalf, it shall provide the Company with written notice thereof. The Company shall, within five (5) Trading Days (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) of receipt of such notice, make public disclosure of such material, nonpublic information. In the event of a breach of the foregoing covenant by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, in addition to any other remedy provided herein, an Investor shall have the right to make a public disclosure, in the form of a press release, public advertisement or otherwise, of such material, nonpublic information without the prior approval by the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees or agents. No Investor shall have any liability to the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders or agents for any such disclosure. Subject to the foregoing, neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any Investor shall issue any press releases or any other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled, without the prior approval of any Investor, to make any press release or other public disclosure with respect to such transactions (i) in substantial conformity with the 8-K Filing and contemporaneously therewith and (ii) as is required by applicable law and regulations (provided that in the case of clause (i) each Investor shall be consulted by the Company in connection with any such press release or other public disclosure prior to its release). Without the prior written consent of any applicable Investor, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates shall disclose the name of such Investor in any filing, announcement, release or otherwise, unless such disclosure is required by law, regulation or the Principal Market. 

^^*Additional Registration Statements.* Except for registration statements filed in connection with the Merger or the Offering (as defined below), until the Effective Date, the Company shall not file a registration statement under the 1933 Act relating to securities that are not the Securities. 

^^*Corporate Existence.* So long as any Series A Holder beneficially owns any Series A Preferred Shares, the Company shall not be party to any Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) unless the Company is in compliance with the applicable provisions governing Fundamental Transactions set forth in the Certificate of Designations. 

^^*Reservation of Shares.* The Company shall take all action necessary to at all times have authorized, and reserved for the purpose of issuance, no less than [[Percentage 1]]% of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares (assuming for purposes hereof, that the Series A Preferred Shares are convertible at the Conversion Price and without taking into account any limitations on the conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares set forth in the Certificate of Designations). 

^^*Conduct of Business.* The business of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be conducted in violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any governmental entity, except where such violations would not result, either individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect. 

^^*Additional Issuances of Securities*. 

^^*Withholding Taxes.* On each Dividend Date (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), if the Company does not have current or accumulated "earnings and profits" within the meaning of Sections 301 and 312 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, through such Dividend Date, the Company shall not withhold any amount of the applicable Dividend (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) in respect of U.S. federal income tax. On or prior to any such Dividend Date, the Company shall deliver a transmittal letter to the Series A Holder or the Series A Holder's prime broker indicating whether the Company believes it must withhold any amount of such Dividend, whether the Company has any "earnings or profits" and the calculations, in reasonable detail, supporting such calculations. 

^^**[Intentionally omitted]**

^^*Trading in Common Stock.* For so long as such Series A Holder owns any Securities, such Series A Holder shall not maintain a Net Short Position. For purposes of this Section, a "***Net Short Position***" by a person means a position whereby such person has executed one or more sales of Common Stock that is marked as a short sale and that is executed at a time when such Series A Holder has no equivalent offsetting long position in the Common Stock or contract for the foregoing. For purposes of determining whether a Series A Holder has an equivalent offsetting long position in the Common Stock, all Common Stock (i) that is owned by such Series A Holder, (ii) that may be issued pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations to the Series A Holder or (iii) that would be issuable upon conversion or exercise in full of all securities of the Series A Holder (including the Securities) then held by such Series A Holder (assuming that such securities were then fully convertible or exercisable, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, and giving effect to any conversion or exercise price adjustments that would take effect given only the passage of time) shall be deemed to be held long by such Series A Holder. Without limiting the foregoing, the Series A Holders may engage in hedging activities at various times during the period following the public announcement of the execution of this Agreement as provided in Section 10(e), and during the period that any Securities are outstanding. 

^^*Transfer or Resale.* Each Series A Holder understands that except as provided in this Agreement: (i) the Securities have not been and are not being registered under the 1933 Act or any state securities laws, and may not be offered for sale, sold, assigned or transferred unless (A) subsequently registered thereunder, (B) such Series A Holder shall have delivered to the Company an opinion of counsel, in a generally acceptable form, to the effect that such Securities to be sold, assigned or transferred may be sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration, or (C) such Series A Holder provides the Company with reasonable assurance that such Securities can be sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A promulgated under the 1933 Act; (ii) any sale of the Securities made in reliance on Rule 144 may be made only in accordance with the terms of Rule 144 and further, if Rule 144 is not applicable, any resale of the Securities under circumstances in which the seller (or the Person) through whom the sale is made) may be deemed to be an underwriter (as that term is defined in the 1933 Act) may require compliance with some other exemption under the 1933 Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder; and (iii) neither the Company nor any other Person is under any obligation to register the Securities under the 1933 Act or any state securities laws or to comply with the terms and conditions of any exemption thereunder. The Securities may be pledged in connection with a bona fide margin account or other loan or financing arrangement secured by the Securities and such pledge of Securities shall not be deemed to be a transfer, sale or assignment of the Securities hereunder, and no Series A Holder effecting a pledge of Securities shall be required to provide the Company with any notice thereof or otherwise make any delivery to the Company pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, this Section 10(n). 

^^*Legends.* Each Series A Holder understands that the certificates or other instruments representing the Series A Preferred Shares and the stock certificates representing the Conversion Shares, except as set forth below, shall bear any legend as required by the "blue sky" laws of any state and a restrictive legend in substantially the following form (and a stop-transfer order may be placed against transfer of such stock certificates): 

The legend set forth above shall be removed and the Company shall issue a certificate without such legend to the holder of the Series A Preferred Shares upon which it is stamped, if, unless otherwise required by state securities laws, (i) such Series A Preferred Shares are registered for resale under the 1933 Act, (ii) in connection with a sale, assignment or other transfer, such holder provides the Company with an opinion of counsel, in a generally acceptable form, to the effect that such sale, assignment or transfer of the Series A Preferred Shares may be made without registration under the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, or (iii) such holder provides the Company with reasonable assurance that the Series A Preferred Shares can be sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to Rule 144(b). 

^*Register; Transfer Agent Instructions.* 

^^*Register.* The Company shall maintain at its principal executive offices (or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice to each holder of Securities), a register for the Series A Preferred Shares and the Conversion Shares in which the Company shall record the name and address of the Person in whose name the Series A Preferred Shares and the Conversion Shares have been issued (including the name and address of each transferee), the number of Series A Preferred Shares held by such Person and the number of Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares held by such Person. The Company shall keep the register open and available at all times during business hours for inspection of any Series A Holder or its legal representatives. 

^^*Transfer Agent Instructions.* The Company shall issue irrevocable instructions to its transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent"), and any subsequent transfer agent, to issue certificates or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at the Transfer Agent, registered in the name of each Series A Holder or its respective nominee(s), for the Series A Preferred Shares issued at the Closing and for the Conversion Shares in such amounts as specified from time to time by each Series A Holder to the Company upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares in the form of *Exhibit D* attached hereto (the "***Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions***"). The Company warrants that no instruction other than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions referred to in this Section 11(b), and stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 10(o) hereof, will be given by the Company to its transfer agent with respect to the Securities, and that the Securities shall otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of the Company, as applicable, and to the extent provided in this Agreement. If a Series A Holder effects a sale, assignment or transfer of the Securities in accordance with Section 10(n), the Company shall permit the transfer and shall promptly instruct its transfer agent to issue one or more certificates or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at the Transfer Agent in such name and in such denominations as specified by such Series A Holder to effect such sale, transfer or assignment. In the event that such sale, assignment or transfer involves Conversion Shares sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement with prospectus delivery (unless an exemption from the prospectus delivery requirements is available), or pursuant to Rule 144, the transfer agent shall issue such Securities to the Series A Holder, assignee or transferee, as the case may be, without any restrictive legend. 

^^*Breach.* The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations under this Section 11 will cause irreparable harm to a Series A Holder and that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Section 11 will be inadequate. In addition, the Company agrees, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Company of the provisions of this Section 11, that a Series A Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to seek an order and/or injunction restraining any breach and requiring immediate issuance and transfer, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. 

^^*Additional Relief.* If the Company shall fail for any reason or for no reason to issue to such holder unlegended certificates within three (3) Business Days of receipt of documents necessary for the removal of legend set forth above (the "***Deadline Date***"), then, in addition to all other remedies available to the holder, if on or after the Trading Day (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) immediately following such three (3) Business Day period, the holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the holder of shares of Common Stock that the holder anticipated receiving from the Company (a **"***Buy-In*****"**), then the Company shall, within three (3) Business Days after the holder's request and in the holder's discretion, either (i) pay cash to the holder in an amount equal to the holder's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (the **"*****Buy-In Price*****"**), at which point the Company's obligation to deliver such certificate (and to issue such shares of Common Stock) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to deliver to the holder a certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock and pay cash to the holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of (A) such number of shares of Common Stock, times (B) the Closing Bid Price on the Deadline Date. "*Closing Bid Price***" means, for any security as of any date, the last closing price for such security on the Principal Market, as reported by Bloomberg (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), or, if the Principal Market begins to operate on an extended hours basis and does not designate the closing bid price then the last bid price of such security prior to 4:00:00 p.m., [[Address 4: Address]], as reported by Bloomberg, or, if the Principal Market is not the principal securities exchange or trading market for such security, the last closing price of such security on the principal securities exchange or trading market where such security is listed or traded as reported by Bloomberg, or if the foregoing do not apply, the last closing price of such security in the over-the-counter market on the electronic bulletin board for such security as reported by Bloomberg, or, if no closing bid price is reported for such security by Bloomberg, the average of the bid prices of any market makers for such security as reported in the "pink sheets" by Pink Sheets LLC (formerly the National Quotation Bureau, Inc.). If the Closing Bid Price cannot be calculated for a security on a particular date on any of the foregoing bases, the Closing Bid Price of such security on such date shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Company and the holder. If the Company and the holder are unable to agree upon the fair market value of such security, then such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 2(d)(iii) of the Certificate of Designations. All such determinations to be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination or other similar transaction during the applicable calculation period. 

^*Amendment and Restatement of Securities Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement.* The Company, Cano and the Series A Holders agree that the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement are hereby amended and restated in their entirety by this Agreement and upon execution of this Agreement (i) the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement shall be of no further force and effect, and (ii) all rights and obligations of Cano and the Series A Holders under the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement shall be superseded by this Agreement; provided, however, that the Series A Holders shall retain any rights and remedies that they have under the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement, as applicable, as a direct result of any breach of the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement by Cano occurring prior to the Closing Date, including rights to indemnification thereunder. 

^*Miscellaneous.* 

^^A Person is deemed to be a holder of Registrable Securities whenever such Person owns or is deemed to own of record such Registrable Securities. If the Company receives conflicting instructions, notices or elections from two or more Persons with respect to the same Registrable Securities, the Company shall act upon the basis of instructions, notice or election received from the such record owner of such Registrable Securities.

^^Failure of any party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement or otherwise, or delay by a party in exercising such right or remedy, shall not operate as a waiver thereof. 

^^All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of [[Address 5: Address]] effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [[Address 6: Address]] other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdictions other than the State of [[Address 7: Address]] hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of [[Address 8: Address]] Manhattan, for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper.

\centered **CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS, PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF [[Cano]] 

\centered **CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS, PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF [[Cano]] 

[[Cano]] (the "**Company**"), a corporation organized and existing under the Texas Business Organization Code (the "**TBOC**"), does hereby certify that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company by the Certificate of Formation, of the Company, and pursuant to the TBOC, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions (i) designating a series of the Company's previously authorized preferred stock, without par value per share, and (ii) providing for the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of Forty Nine Thousand One Hundred Sixteen ([[Shares 1: Number]]) shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, as follows: 

RESOLVED, that the Company is authorized to issue 49,116 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "**Preferred Shares**"), without par value per share, which shall have the following powers, designations, preferences and other special rights: 

^*Dividends.* The holders of the Preferred Shares (each, a "**Holder**" and collectively, the "**Holders**") shall be entitled to receive dividends ("**Dividends**") payable in cash on the Stated Value (as defined below) of such Preferred Share at the Dividend Rate (as defined below), which shall be cumulative. Dividends on the Preferred Shares shall commence accruing on the Initial Issuance Date and shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. To the extent permitted by law, Dividends shall be payable (a) in arrears on the last day of each Calendar Quarter (each, an "**Dividend Date**") with the first Dividend Date being [[Date 4: Date]], (b) on each Conversion Date thereafter by inclusion in the applicable Conversion Amount (as defined below) and (c) on the Maturity Date (as defined below) (each, a "**Dividend Date**"). If a Dividend Date is not a Business Day (as defined below), then the Dividend shall be due and payable on the Business Day immediately following such Dividend Date. On each Dividend Date, if the Company does not have current or accumulated "earnings and profits" within the meaning of Sections 301 and 312 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, through such Dividend Date, the Company shall not withhold any amount of the applicable Dividend in respect of U.S. federal income tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any Electing Holder the Company shall not pay any Dividends in cash on the Dividend Date but instead such Dividends shall be included in the calculation of such Holder's Conversion Amount for purposes of any conversion or redemption hereunder. 

^*Conversion of Preferred Shares.* Preferred Shares shall be convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $[[USD Value 3]] per share (the "**Common Stock**"), on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2. 

\centered 

Conversion Amount 

Conversion Price

^*Redemption at Option of Holders.* 

^*Other Rights of Holders.* 

^*Reservation of Shares.* 

^*Voting Rights.* Subject to Sections 7 and 10, each Holder shall be entitled to the whole number of votes equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Holder's Preferred Shares would be convertible based on the Conversion Price on the record date for the vote or consent of stockholders, and shall otherwise have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the Common Stock and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Holder's Preferred Shares would be convertible if the Conversion Price on the record date for the vote or consent of stockholders is deemed to be the Market Price. Each Holder shall be entitled to receive the same prior notice of any stockholders' meeting as is provided to the holders of Common Stock in accordance with the bylaws of the Company, as well as prior notice of all stockholder actions to be taken by legally available means in lieu of a meeting, and shall vote as a class with the holders of Common Stock as if they were a single class of securities upon any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders, except those matters required by law or by the terms hereof to be submitted to a class vote of the Holders of Preferred Shares, in which case the Holders of Preferred Shares only shall vote as a separate class. 

^*Limitation on Beneficial Ownership.* The Company shall not effect any conversion of Preferred Shares, and no Holder shall have the right to convert any Preferred Shares, to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, the beneficial owner of such shares (together with such Person's affiliates) would have acquired, through conversion of Preferred Shares or otherwise, beneficial ownership of a number of shares of Common Stock that exceeds the maximum ownership percentage set forth opposite each Holder's name on *Exhibit E* to the Investors Rights Agreement ("**Maximum Percentage**") of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. The Company shall not give effect to any voting rights of the Preferred Shares, and any Holder shall not have the right to exercise voting rights with respect to any Preferred Shares pursuant hereto, to the extent that giving effect to such voting rights would result in such Holder (together with its affiliates) being deemed to beneficially own in excess of the Maximum Percentage of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise, assuming such exercise as being equivalent to conversion. For purposes of the foregoing, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by a Person and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted Preferred Shares beneficially owned by such Person or any of its affiliates and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any notes or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section beneficially owned by such Person or any of its affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 7, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For purposes of this Section 7, in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (1) the Company's most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-KSB, Form 10-Q, Form 10-QSB or Form 8-K, as the case may be, (2) a more recent public announcement by the Company, or (3) any other notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day following the receipt of such notice, confirm orally and in writing to any such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including the Preferred Shares, by such Holder and its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. By written notice to the Company, the Holder may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of [[Percentage 4: Number]]% specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Holder providing such written notice and not to any other Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder has elected "no limit" on *Exhibit E* to the Investors Rights Agreement, the limitations set forth in this Section 7 shall not be applicable to such Holder. 

^*Change of Control Redemption Right; Liquidation, Dissolution, Winding-Up.* 

^*Ranking; Issuances of Other Securities.* 

^*Limitation on Number of Conversion Shares.* Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not issue any shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Shares if the issuance of such shares of Common Stock would exceed that number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue upon conversion of the Preferred Shares without breaching the Company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market, or the market or exchange where the Common Stock is then traded (the "**Exchange Cap**"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (a) obtains stockholder approval as required by the applicable rules of the Principal Market (and any successor rule or regulation) for issuances of Common Stock in excess of such amount, or (b) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. Until such approval or written opinion is obtained, no Holder on the Initial Issuance Date (the "**Purchasers**") shall be issued, in the aggregate, upon conversion of Preferred Shares, shares of Common Stock in an amount greater than the product of (i) the Exchange Cap amount multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Preferred Shares owned by such Purchaser on the Initial Issuance Date and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of all of the Preferred Shares owned by all of the Purchasers on the Initial Issuance Date (the "**Exchange Cap Allocation**"). In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Purchaser's Preferred Shares, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Purchaser's Exchange Cap Allocation. In the event that any Holder shall convert all of such Holder's Preferred Shares into a number of shares of Common Stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such Holder's Exchange Cap Allocation, then the difference between such Holder's Exchange Cap Allocation and the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such Holder shall be allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining Holders on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of Preferred Shares then held by each such Holder. 

^*Participation.* Subject to the rights of the holders, if any, of the Pari Passu Shares, the Holders shall, as holders of Preferred Stock, be entitled to such dividends paid and distributions made to the holders of Common Stock to the same extent as if such Holders had converted the Preferred Shares into Common Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion herein or elsewhere) and had held such shares of Common Stock on the record date for such dividends and distributions. Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend or distribution to the holders of Common Stock. Following the occurrence of a Liquidation Event and the payment in full to a Holder of its applicable liquidation preference, such Holder shall cease to have any rights hereunder to participate in any future dividends or distributions made to the holders of Common Stock. 

^*Vote to Change the Terms of or Issue Preferred Shares.* Except where the vote or written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares is required by law or by another provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent without a meeting of the Required Holders, voting together as a single class, shall be required before the Company may: (a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, or file any articles of amendment, certificate of designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of any series of preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of, or restrictions provided for the benefit of the Preferred Shares, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or by merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the authorized number of shares of Preferred Shares; (c) create or authorize (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class or series of shares that has a preference over or is on a parity with the Preferred Shares with respect to dividends or the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; (d) purchase, repurchase or redeem any shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to equity incentive agreements with employees giving the Company the right to repurchase shares upon the termination of services at cost); (e) pay dividends or make any other distribution on the Common Stock; or (f) whether or not prohibited by the terms of the Preferred Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares. 

^*Lost or Stolen Certificates.* Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Preferred Stock Certificates representing the Preferred Shares, and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of an indemnification undertaking by the Holder to the Company in customary form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of the Preferred Stock Certificate(s), the Company shall execute and deliver new preferred stock certificate(s) of like tenor and date; *provided*, *however*, the Company shall not be obligated to re-issue preferred stock certificates if the Holder contemporaneously requests the Company to convert such Preferred Shares into Common Stock. 

^*Remedies, Characterizations, Other Obligations, Breaches and Injunctive Relief.* Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, the remedies provided in this Certificate of Designations shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Certificate of Designations, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief). Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, no remedy contained herein shall be deemed a waiver of compliance with the provisions giving rise to such remedy. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, nothing herein shall limit a Holder's right to pursue actual damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Certificate of Designations. The Company covenants to each Holder that there shall be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by the Holder thereof and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holders and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, the Holders shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Holder shall be entitled to consequential, indirect or incidental damages hereunder. However, the foregoing shall not in any way limit a Holder from being reimbursed for its costs, fees or expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements in connection with any of its rights and remedies hereunder. 

^*Construction.* This Certificate of Designations shall be deemed to be jointly drafted by the Company and all Holders and shall not be construed against any person as the drafter hereof. 

^*Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver.* No failure or delay on the part of a Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. 

^*Notice.* Whenever notice or other communication is required to be given under this Certificate of Designations, unless otherwise provided herein, such notice shall be given in accordance with Section 13(b) of the Investors Rights Agreement. 

^*Transfer of Preferred Shares.* A Holder may assign some or all of the Preferred Shares and the accompanying rights hereunder held by such Holder without the consent of the Company; *provided* that such assignment is in compliance with applicable securities laws. 

^*Preferred Share Register.* The Company shall maintain at its principal executive offices (or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice to the Holders), a register for the Preferred Shares, in which the Company shall record the name and address of the persons in whose name the Preferred Shares have been issued, as well as the name and address of each transferee. The Company may treat the person in whose name any Preferred Share is registered on the register as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, but in all events recognizing any properly made transfers. 

^*Stockholder Matters.* Any stockholder action, approval or consent required, desired or otherwise sought by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Principal Market, the TBOC, this Certificate of Designations or otherwise with respect to the issuance of the Preferred Shares or the Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof may be effected by written consent of the Company's stockholders or at a duly called meeting of the Company's stockholders, all in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Principal Market and the TBOC. This provision is intended to comply with the applicable sections of the TBOC permitting stockholder action, approval and consent affected by written consent in lieu of a meeting. 

^*Disclosure.* Upon receipt or delivery by the Company of any notice in accordance with the terms of this Certificate of Designations, unless the Company has in good faith determined that the matters relating to such notice do not constitute material, nonpublic information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day after any such receipt or delivery publicly disclose such material, nonpublic information on a Current Report on Form 8-K or otherwise. In the event that the Company believes that a notice contains material, nonpublic information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company so shall indicate to the Holders contemporaneously with delivery of such notice, and in the absence of any such indication, the Holders shall be allowed to presume that all matters relating to such notice do not constitute material, nonpublic information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries. 

^**SUBORDINATION.**

\centered **EXHIBIT B SELLING SHAREHOLDERS** 

The shares of Common Stock being offered by the Selling Shareholders are those issuable to the Selling Shareholders upon conversion of the convertible preferred shares. For additional information regarding the issuance of those convertible preferred shares, see "Issuance of Series A Preferred Stock" above. We are registering the shares of Common Stock in order to permit the selling shareholders to offer the shares for resale from time to time. Except for **[disclose shareholder relationships]** and the ownership of certain shares of Common Stock and the convertible preferred shares, the selling shareholders have not had any material relationship with us within the past three years. 

The table below lists the Selling Shareholders and other information regarding the beneficial ownership of the shares of Common Stock by each of the Selling Shareholders. The second column lists the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by each Selling Shareholder, based on its ownership of the convertible preferred shares, as of , 2010, assuming conversion of all convertible preferred shares held by the selling shareholders on that date without regard to any limitations on conversions. 

The third column lists the shares of Common Stock being offered by this prospectus by the Selling Shareholders. 

In accordance with the terms of an investors rights agreement with the selling shareholders, this prospectus generally covers the resale of at least [[Percentage 1]]% of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred shares as of the **[first trading day TBD]**. Because the conversion price of the convertible preferred shares may be adjusted, the number of shares that will actually be issued may be more or less than the number of shares being offered by this prospectus. The fourth column assumes the sale of all of the shares offered by the Selling Shareholders pursuant to this prospectus. 

Under the terms of the certificate of designations, a Selling Shareholder may not convert the preferred shares to the extent such conversion would cause such Selling Shareholder, together with its affiliates, to beneficially own a number of shares of Common Stock which would exceed a percentage specified by the Selling Shareholder of our then outstanding shares of Common Stock following such conversion, excluding for purposes of such determination shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred shares which have not been converted. The number of shares in the second column does not reflect this limitation. The Selling Shareholders may sell all, some or none of their shares in this offering. See "Plan of Distribution." 

**Name of Selling Shareholder**      **Number of Ordinary Shares Owned Prior to Offering**      **Maximum Number of Ordinary Shares to be Sold Pursuant to this Prospectus**      **Number of Ordinary Shares Owned After Offering** [Series A Holder]                           [Other Series A Holders]

\centered **PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION** 

We are registering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred shares to permit the resale of these shares of Common Stock by the holders of the preferred shares from time to time after the date of this prospectus. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale by the selling shareholders of the shares of Common Stock. We will bear all fees and expenses incident to our obligation to register the shares of Common Stock. 

The selling shareholders may sell all or a portion of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them and offered hereby from time to time directly or through one or more underwriters, broker-dealers or agents. If the shares of Common Stock are sold through underwriters or broker-dealers, the selling shareholders will be responsible for underwriting discounts or commissions or agent's commissions. The shares of Common Stock may be sold in one or more transactions at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected in transactions, which may involve crosses or block transactions, 

If the selling shareholders effect such transactions by selling shares of Common Stock to or through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, such underwriters, broker-dealers or agents may receive commissions in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling shareholders or commissions from purchasers of the shares of Common Stock for whom they may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal (which discounts, concessions or commissions as to particular underwriters, broker-dealers or agents may be in excess of those customary in the types of transactions involved). In connection with sales of the shares of Common Stock or otherwise, the selling shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, which may in turn engage in short sales of the shares of Common Stock in the course of hedging in positions they assume. The selling shareholders may also sell shares of Common Stock short and deliver shares of Common Stock covered by this prospectus to close out short positions and to return borrowed shares in connection with such short sales. The selling shareholders may also loan or pledge shares of Common Stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell such shares. 

The selling shareholders may pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the preferred shares or shares of Common Stock owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the shares of Common Stock from time to time pursuant to this prospectus or any amendment to this prospectus under 

Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "***Securities Act***"), amending, if necessary, the list of selling shareholders to include, pursuant to prospectus amendment or prospectus supplement, the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling shareholders under this prospectus. The selling shareholders also may transfer and donate the shares of Common Stock in other circumstances in which case the transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus. 

The selling shareholders and any broker-dealer participating in the distribution of the shares of Common Stock may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any commission paid, or any discounts or concessions allowed to, any such broker-dealer may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. At the time a particular offering of the shares of Common Stock is made, a prospectus supplement, if required, will be distributed which will set forth the aggregate amount of shares of Common Stock being offered and the terms of the offering, including the name or names of any broker-dealers or agents, any discounts, commissions and other terms constituting compensation from the selling shareholders and any discounts, commissions or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to broker-dealers. 

Under the securities laws of some states, the shares of Common Stock may be sold in such states only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in some states the shares of Common Stock may not be sold unless such shares have been registered or qualified for sale in such state or an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied with. 

There can be no assurance that any selling shareholder will sell any or all of the shares of Common Stock registered pursuant to the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part. 

The selling shareholders and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "***Exchange Act***"), and the rules and regulations thereunder, including, without limitation, Regulation M of the Exchange Act, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the shares of Common Stock by the selling shareholders and any other participating person. Regulation M may also restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the shares of Common Stock to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of Common Stock. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the shares of Common Stock and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of Common Stock. 

We will pay all expenses of the registration of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the investors rights agreement, estimated to be $ [ ] in total, including, without limitation, Securities and Exchange Commission filing fees and expenses of compliance with state securities or "blue sky" laws; provided, however, that a selling shareholder will pay all underwriting discounts and selling commissions, if any. We will indemnify the selling shareholders against liabilities, including some liabilities under the Securities Act, in accordance with the registration rights agreements, or the selling shareholders will be entitled to contribution. We may be indemnified by the selling shareholders against civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, that may arise from any written information furnished to us by the selling shareholder specifically for use in this prospectus, in accordance with the related registration rights agreement, or we may be entitled to contribution. 

Once sold under the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part, the shares of Common Stock will be freely tradable in the hands of persons other than our affiliates.
