\centered **Plan Document**

^**Introduction****.**  
^^Purpose. Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp. (the “**Company**”) hereby establishes this equity-based incentive compensation plan to be known as the Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the “**Plan**”), for the following purposes: (i) to enhance the Company’s ability to attract highly qualified personnel; (ii) to strengthen its retention capabilities; (iii) to enhance the long-term performance and competitiveness of the Company; and (iv) to align the interests of Pla n participants with those of the Company’s stockholders.

^^Definitions. Terms that begin with an initial capital letter in the Plan and any Appendices have the defined meaning set forth in Appendix I or elsewhere in this Plan, in either case unless the context of their use clearly indicates a different meaning.

^^Effective Date. This Plan shall become effective on [[Date 1: Date]] (the “**Effective Date**”); provided that the Plan and any Award made before stockholder approval of the Plan shall be contingent on itsapproval by a vote of a majority of the votes cast at a duly held meeting of the Company’s stockholders (or by such other stockholder vote that the Committee determines to be sufficient for the issuance of Shares and Awards according to the Company’s governing documents and Applicable Law). div>  
^^Effect on Other Plans, Awards, and Arrangements. Once approved by the Company’s stockholders pursuant to Section 1(c), this Plan will supersede all stock plans of the Company such that no future awards will occur except under this Plan. New awards may occur with respect to shares subject to awards forfeited under superseded plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective upon stockholder approval of this Plan, no further awards of any kind shall occur under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (formerly the Raptor Pharmaceuticals Corp.’s 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, which was assumed by the Company, and any Shares that are currently reserved for awards under such plan, the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (formerly the TorreyPines 2006 Equity Incentive Plan) or the 2000 Stock Option Plan (formerly the Axonyx 2000 Stock Option Plan), as well as any Shares that in the future would have become available for awards under those plans shall be added to the reserve of Shares that are authorized and available for issuance pursuant to this Plan.

^^Appendices. [[Party 1]] by reference and thereby part of the Plan are the terms set forth in the following appendices:

Appendix I   Definitions
Appendix II   Special sub-plan for Non U.S.-Based Eligible Employees.

^**Types of Awards**. The Plan permits the granting of the following types of Awards according to the Sections of the Plan listed here:

^Stock Options
^Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units (“RSUs”)

^**Shares Available for Awards****.**  
^^Generally. Subject to Section 9 below, a total of 3 million Shares shall be available for issuance under the Plan, which includes the 1.2 million Shares that were available for issuance under the three plans identified in Section 1(d) as of [[Date 2: Date]], all of which may be used for any form of Award under the Plan. The Shares deliverable pursuant to Awards shall be authorized but unissued Shares, or Shares that the Company otherwise holds in treasury or in trust.

^^Replenishment; Counting of Shares. Any Shares reserved for Plan Awards will again be available for future Awards if the Shares for any reason will never be issued to a Participant or Beneficiary pursuant to an Award (for example, due to its settlement in cash rather than in Shares, or the Award’s forfeiture, cancellation, expiration, or net settlement without the issuance of Shares). Further, and to the extent permitted under Applicable Law, the maximum number of Shares available for delivery under the Plan shall not be reduced by any Shares issued under the Plan through the settlement, assumption, or substitution of outstanding awards or obligat ions to grant future awards as a condition of the Company’s or an Affiliate’s acquiring another entity. On the other hand, Shares that a Person owns and tenders in payment of all or part of the exercise price of an Award or in satisfaction of applicable Withholding Taxes shall not increase the number of Shares available for future issuance under the Plan.

^^ISO Share Reserve. The number of Shares that are available for ISO Awards shall not exceed the total number set forth in Section 3(a) above (as adjusted pursuant to Section 9 of the Plan, and as determined in accordance with Code Section 422).

^**Eligibility.**   
^^General Rule. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine from the class of Eligible Persons those Persons to whom Awards may be granted. Each Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that sets forth its Grant Date and all other terms and conditions of the Award, that is signed on behalf of the Company (or delivered by an authorized agent through an electronic medium), and that, if required by the Committee, is signed by the Eligible Person as an acceptance of the Award. The grant of an Award shall not obligate the Company or any Affiliate to continue the employment or service of any Eligible Person, or to provide any future Awards or other remuneration at any time thereafter.

^^Award Limits per Person. During the term of the Plan, no Participant may receive Awards that relate to more than [[Shares 1: Number]] shares per year.

^**Stock Options.**

^^Grants. Subject to the special rules for ISOs set forth in the next paragraph, the Committee may grant Options to Eligible Persons pursuant to Award Agreements setting forth terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan, that may be immediately exercisable or that may become exercisable in whole or in part based on future events or conditions, that may include vesting or other requirements for the right to exercise the Option, and that may differ for any reason between Eligible Persons or classes of Eligible Persons, ***provided*** in all instances that:

^^^the exercise price for Shares subject to purchase through exercise of an Option shall not be less than [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares on the Grant Date; and

^^^no Option shall be exercisable for a term ending more than ten years after its Grant Date.

^^Special ISO Provisions. The following provisions shall control any grants of Options that are denominated as ISOs.

^^^**Eligibility**. The Committee may grant ISOs only to Employees (including officers who are Employees) of the Company or an Affiliate that is a “parent corporation” or “subsidiary corporation” within the meaning of Code Section 424.

^^^**Documentation**. Each Option that is intended to be an ISO must be designated in the Award Agreement as an ISO, ***provided*** that any Option designated as an ISO will be a Non-ISO to the extent the Option fails to meet the requirements of Code Section 422. In the case of an ISO, the Committee shall determine on the Date of Grant the acceptable methods of paying the exercise price for Shares, and it shall be included in the applicable Award Agreement.

^^^**$[[USD Value 1: Number]] Limit**. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares with respect to which ISOs first become exercisable by a Participant in any calendar year (under this Plan and any other plan of the Company or any Affiliate) exceeds U.S. $[[USD Value 2: Number]] such excess Options shall be treated as Non-ISOs. For purposes of determining whether the U.S. $[[USD Value 1]] limit is exceeded, the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to an ISO shall be determined as of the Grant Date. In reducing the number of Options treated as ISOs to meet the U.S. $[[USD Value 1]] limit, the most recently granted Options shall be reduced first. In the event that Code Section 422 is amended to alter the limitation set forth therein, the limitation of this paragraph shall be auto matically adjusted accordingly.

^^^**Grants to [[Percentage 2: Number]]% Holders**. In the case of an ISO granted to an Employee who is a Ten Percent Holder on the Grant Date, the ISO’s term shall not exceed five years from the Grant Date, and the exercise price shall be at least [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares on the Grant Date. In the event that Code Section 422 is amended to alter the limitations set forth therein, the limitation of this paragraph shall be automatically adjusted accordingly.

^^^**Substitution of Options**. In the event the Company or an Affiliate acquires (whether by purchase, merger, or otherwise) all or substantially all of outstanding capital stock or assets of another corporation or in the event of any reorganization or other transaction qualifying under Code Section 424, the Committee may, in accordance with the provisions of that Section, substitute ISOs for ISOs previously granted under the plan of the acquired company provided (A) the excess of the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to an ISO immediately after the substitution over the aggregate exercise price of such shares is not more than the similar excess immediately before such substitution, and (B) the new ISO does not give additional benefits to the Participant, including a ny extension of the exercise period.

^^^**Notice of Disqualifying Dispositions**. By executing an ISO Award Agreement, each Participant agrees to notify the Company in writing immediately after the Participant sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of any Shares acquired through exercise of the ISO, if such disposition occurs within the earlier of (A) two years of the Grant Date, or (B) one year after the exercise of the ISO being exercised. Each Participant further agrees to provide any information about a disposition of Shares as may be requested by the Company to assist it in complying with any applicable tax laws.

^^Method of Exercise. Each Option may be exercised, in whole or in part (***provided*** that the Company shall not be required to issue fractional Shares) at any time and from time to time prior to its expiration, but only pursuant to the terms of the applicable Award Agreement, and subject to the times, circumstances and conditions for exercise contained in the applicable Award Agreement. To the extent that Options are exercised, they shall be exercised with respect to the first-vested Options, unless expressly provided otherwise in the documents evidencing the exercise. Ex ercise shall occur by delivery of both written notice of exercise to the secretary of the Company, and payment of the full exercise price for the Shares being purchased. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the methods of payment that the Committee may in its discretion accept or commit to accept in an Award Agreement include:

^^^Cash;  
^^^Certified check, wire transfer, or equivalent; or

^^^Any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.

The Company shall not be required to deliver Shares pursuant to the exercise of an Option until the Company has received sufficient funds to cover the full exercise price due and all applicable Withholding Taxes required by reason of such exercise.

No Participant who is a Director or an “executive officer” of the Company within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act shall be permitted to make payment with respect to any Awards granted under the Plan, or continue any extension of credit with respect to such payment with a loan from the Company or a loan arranged by the Company in violation of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act.

^^Termination of Continuous Service. The Committee may establish and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement the terms and conditions on which an Option shall remain exercisable, if at all, following termination of a Participant’s Continuous Service. The Committee may waive or modify these provisions at any time. To the extent that a Participant is not entitled to exercise an Option at the date of his or her termination of Continuous Service, or if the Participant (or other person entitled to exercise the Option) does not exercise the Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified in the Award Agreement or below (as appli cable), the Option shall terminate and the Shares underlying the unexercised portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan and become available for future Awards.

The following provisions shall apply to the extent an Award Agreement does not specify contrary terms and conditions upon which an Option shall terminate when there is a termination of a Participant’s Continuous Service:

**Reason for terminating Continuous Service**   **Option Termination Date**
^^^By the Company for Cause, or what would have been Cause if the Company had known all of the relevant facts.   Termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service, or when Cause first existed if earlier.
^^^Participant is Disabled.   Within one year after termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service.
^^^Retirement of the Participant.   Within six months after termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service.
^^^Death of the Participant during Continuous Service or within 90 days thereafter.   Within oneyear after termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service.
^Other than due to Cause or the Participant’s Disability, Retirement, or Death.   Within 90 days after termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service.

If there is a Securities and Exchange Commission blackout period (or a Committee-imposed blackout period) that prohibits the buying or selling of Shares during any part of the ten day period before the expiration of any Option based on the termination of a Participant’s Continuous Service (as described above), the period for exercising the Options shall be extended until ten days beyond when such blackout period ends. Notwithstanding any provision hereof or within an Award Agreement, no Option shall ever be exercisable after the expiration date of its original term as set forth in the Award Agreement.

^**Restricted Shares and RSUs.**

^^Grant. The Committee may grant Restricted Share and RSU Awards to Eligible Persons, in all cases pursuant to Award Agreements setting forth terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan. The Committee shall establish as to each Restricted Share or RSU Award the number of Shares deliverable or subject to the Award (which number may be determined by a written formula), and the period or periods of time (the “**Restriction Period**”) at the end of which all or some restrictions specified in the Award Agreement shall lapse, and the Participant shall r eceive unrestricted Shares (or cash to the extent provided in the Award Agreement) in settlement of the Award. Such restrictions may include, without limitation, restrictions concerning voting rights and transferability, and such restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times and pursuant to such circumstances or based on such criteria as selected by the Committee, including, without limitation, criteria based on the Participant’s duration of employment, directorship or consultancy with the Company, individual, group, or divisional performance criteria, Company performance, or other criteria selected by the Committee. The Committee may make Restricted Share and RSU Awards with or without the requirement for payment of cash or other consideration.

^^Vesting and Forfeiture. The Committee shall set forth, in an Award Agreement granting Restricted Shares or RSUs, the terms and conditions under which the Participant’s interest in the Restricted Shares or the Shares subject to RSUs will become vested and non-forfeitable. Except as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement or as the Committee otherwise determines, upon termination of a Participant’s Continuous Service for any reason, the Participant shall forfeit his or her Restricted Shares and RSUs to the extent the Participant’s interest therein has not vested on or before such termination date; provided that if a Participant purchases Restricted Shares and forfeits them for any reason, the Company shall return the purchase price to the Participant to the extent either set forth in an Award Agreement or required by Applicable Laws.

^^Certificates for Restricted Shares. Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, the Company shall hold certificates representing Restricted Shares and dividends (whether in Shares or cash) that accrue with respect to them until the restrictions lapse, and the Participant shall provide the Company with appropriate stock powers endorsed in blank. The Participant’s failure to provide such stock powers within ten days after a written request from the Company shall entitle the Committee to unilaterally declare a forfeiture of all or some of the Participant’s Restricted Shares.

^^Section 83(b) Elections. A Participant may make an election under Code Section 83(b) (“**Section 83(b) Election**”) with respect to Restricted Shares. A Participant who has received RSUs may, within ten days after receiving the RSU Award, provide the Committee with a written notice of his or her desire to make a Section 83(b) Election with respect to the Shares subject to such RSUs. The Committee may in its discretion convert the Participant’s RSUs into Restricted Shares, on a one-for-one basis, in full satisfaction of the Participant’s RS U Award. The Participant may then make a Section 83(b) Election with respect to those Restricted Shares; provided that the Participant’s Section 83(b) Election will be invalid if not filed with the Company and the appropriate U.S. tax authorities within 30 days after the Grant Date of the RSUs replaced by the Restricted Shares.

^^Issuance of Shares upon Vesting. As soon as practicable after vesting of a Participant’s Restricted Shares (or of the right to receive Shares underlying RSUs), the Company shall deliver to the Participant, free from vesting restrictions, one Share for each surrendered and vested Restricted Share (or deliver one Share free of the vesting restriction for each vested RSU), unless an Award Agreement provides otherwise and subject to Section 7 regarding Withholding Taxes. No fractional Shares shall be distributed, and cash shall be paid in lieu thereof.

^**Taxes; Withholding.**  
^^General Rule. Participants are solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may arise in connection with Awards, and neither the Company, any Affiliate, nor any of their employees, directors, or agents shall have any obligation to mitigate, indemnify, or to otherwise hold any Participant harmless from any or all of such taxes. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares (or to pay cash) to Participants pursuant to Awards is at all times subject to their prior or coincident satisfaction of all required Withholding Taxes. Except to the extent otherwise either provided in an Award Agreement or thereaft er authorized by the Committee, the Company or any Affiliate may, but is not obligated to, satisfy required Withholding Taxes that the Participant has not otherwise arranged to settle before the due date thereof –

^^^first from withholding the cash otherwise payable to the Participant pursuant to the Award;

^^^then by withholding and canceling the Participant’s rights with respect to a number of Shares that (A) would otherwise have been delivered to the Participant pursuant to the Award, and (B) have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the Withholding Taxes (such withheld Shares to be valued on the basis of the aggregate Fair Market Value thereof on the date of the withholding); and

^^^finally, withholding the cash otherwise payable to the Participant by the Company.

The number of Shares withheld and canceled to pay a Participant’s Withholding Taxes will be rounded up to the nearest whole Share sufficient to satisfy such taxes, with cash being paid to the Participant in an amount equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value of such Shares exceeds the Withholding Taxes.

^^U.S. Code Section 409A. To the extent that the Committee determines that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to Code Section 409A, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions required by Code Section 409A. To the extent applicable, the Plan and Award Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the C ommittee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate (i) to exempt the Award from Code Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (ii) to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and related Department of Treasury guidance and thereby avoid the application of any penalty taxes under such Section.

^^Unfunded Tax Status. The Plan is intended to be an “unfunded” plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Person pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall give the Person any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate, and a Participant’s rights under the Plan at all times constitute an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company for the collection of benefits as they come due. Neither the Participant nor the Participant’s duly-authorized transferee orBeneficiaries shall have any claim against or rights in any specific assets, Shares, or other funds of the Company.

^**Non-Transferability of Awards.**  
^^General. Except as set forth in this Section, or as otherwise approved by the Committee, Awards may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution. The designation of a death Beneficiary by a Participant will not constitute a transfer. An Award may be exercised, during the lifetime of the holder of an Award, only by such holder, by the duly-authorized legal representative of a holder who is Disabled, or by a transferee permitted by this Section.

^^Limited Transferability Rights.Unless an Award Agreement provides otherwise, the Committee may in its discretion permit individuals to transfer Awards, other than ISOs, on such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate, either (i) by instrument to the Participant’s “Immediate Family” (as defined below), (ii) by instrument to an inter vivos or testamentary trust (or other entity) in which the Award is to be passed to the Participant’s designated beneficiaries, or (iii) by gift to charitable institutions. Any transferee of the Participant’s rights shall succeed and be subject to all of the terms of the applicable Award Agreement and the Plan. “**Immediate Family**” means any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, domestic partner, former spouse, former domestic partner, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, and shall include adoptive relationships.

^^Death. In the event of the death of a Participant, any outstanding Awards issued to the Participant shall automatically be transferred to the Participant’s Beneficiary (or, if no Beneficiary is designated or surviving, to the person or persons to whom the Participant’s rights under the Award pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution).

^**Change in Capital Structure; Change in Control; Etc.**

^^Changes in Capitalization. The Committee shall equitably adjust the number of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the number of Shares that have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or that have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of an Award, as well as the exercise or other price per Share covered by each such outstanding Award, to reflect any increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock-split, reverse stock-split, stock dividend, combination, recapitalization or reclassification of the Shares, merger, consolidation, change in form o f organization, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company. In the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding Awards such alternative consideration (including cash or securities of any surviving entity) as it may in good faith determine to be equitable under the circumstances and may require in connection therewith the surrender of all Awards so replaced. In any case, such substitution of cash or securities shall not require the consent of any person who is granted Awards pursuant to the Plan. Except as expressly provided herein, or in an Award Agreement, if the Company issues for consideration shares of stock of any class or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, the issuance shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be required to be made with respect to the number or price of Shares subject to any Award.

^^Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company other than as part of a Change of Control, each Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such dissolution or liquidation, subject to the ability of the Committee to exercise any discretion authorized in the case of a Change in Control.

^^Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control but subject to the terms of any Award Agreements or employment-related agreements between the Company or any Affiliates and any Participant, each outstanding Award shall be assumed or a substantially equivalent award shall be substituted by the surviving or successor company or a parent or subsidiary of such successor company (in each case, the “**Successor Company**”) upon consummation of the transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, instead of having outstanding Awards be assumed or replaced with equival ent awards by the Successor Company, the Committee may in its sole and absolute discretion and authority, without obtaining the approval or consent of the Company’s stockholders or any Participant with respect to his or her outstanding Awards, take one or more of the following actions (with respect to any or all of the Awards, and with discretion to differentiate between individual Participants and Awards for any reason):

^^^accelerate the vesting of Awards so that Awards shall vest (and, to the extent applicable, become exercisable) as to the Shares that otherwise would have been unvested and provide that repurchase rights of the Company with respect to Shares issued pursuant to an Award shall lapse as to the Shares subject to such repurchase right;

^^^arrange or otherwise provide for the payment of cash or other consideration to Participants in exchange for the satisfaction and cancellation of outstanding Awards (with the Committee determining the amount payable to each Participant based on the Fair Market Value, on the date of the Change in Control, of the Award being canceled, based on any reasonable valuation method selected by the Committee, which amount may be adjusted downward to the extent the Committee reasonably determines required by Section 409A);

^^^terminate all or some Awards upon the consummation of the transaction, provided that the Committee shall provide for vesting of such Awards in full as of a date immediately prior to consummation of the Change in Control. To the extent that an Award is not exercised prior to consummation of a transaction in which the Award is not being assumed or substituted, such Award shall terminate upon such consummation;

^^^make such other modifications, adjustments or amendments to outstanding Awards or this Plan as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate, subject however to the terms of this Section 9.

^**Recoupment of Awards**.** Unless otherwise specifically provided in an Award Agreement, and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Committee may in its sole and absolute discretion, without obtaining the approval or consent of the Company’s stockholders or of any Participant, require that any Participant reimburse the Company for all or any portion of any Awards granted under this Plan (“**Reimbursement**”), terminate any outstanding, unexercised, unexpired, unpaid, or deferred Awar ds (“**Termination**”), rescind any exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to the Award (“**Recission**”), or recapture any Shares (whether restricted or unrestricted) or proceeds from the Participant’s sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Award (“Recapture**”), if and to the extent—

^^the granting, vesting, or payment of such Award was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a material financial restatement;

^^in the Committee’s view the Participant either benefited from a calculation that later proves to be materially inaccurate, or engaged in fraud or misconduct that caused or partially caused the need for a material financial restatement by the Company or any Affiliate; and

^^a lower granting, vesting, or payment of such Award would have occurred based upon the conduct described in clause (b) of this Section.

In each instance, the Committee will, to the extent practicable and allowable under Applicable Laws, require Reimbursement, Termination or Rescission of, or Recapture relating to, any such Award granted to a Participant; provided that the Company will not seek Reimbursement, Termination or Rescission of, or Recapture relating to, any such Awards that were paid or vested more than three years prior to the first date of the applicable restatement period.

^**Relationship to other Benefits****.** No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder.

^**Administration of the Plan****.** The Committee shall administer the Plan in accordance with its terms, provided that the Board may always act as the Committee on any matter. The Committee shall hold meetings at such times and places as it may determine and shall make such rules and regulations for the conduct of its business as it deems advisable. In the absence of a duly appointed Committee, the Board shall function as the Committee for all purposes of the Plan.

^^Committee Composition. The Board shall appoint the members of the Committee if other than the Board. If and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Committee may authorize one or more executive officers to make Awards to Eligible Persons other than themselves. The Board may at any time appoint additional members to the Committee, remove and replace members of the Committee with or without Cause, and fill vacancies on the Committee however caused.

^^Powers of the Committee. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion:

^^^to grant Awards and to determine Eligible Persons to whom Awards shall be granted from time to time, and the number of Shares, units, or dollars to be covered by each Award;

^^^to determine, from time to time, the Fair Market Value of Shares;

^^^to determine, and to set forth in Award Agreements, the terms and conditions of all Awards, including any applicable exercise or purchase price, the installments and conditions under which an Award shall become vested (which may be based on performance), terminated, expired, canceled, or replaced, and the circumstances for vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and other restrictions and limitations;

^^^to approve the forms of Award Agreements and all other documents, notices and certificates in connection therewith which need not be identical either as to type of Award or among Participants;

^^^to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and any Award Agreement, to determine the meaning of their terms, and to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and procedures relating to the Plan and its administration;

^^^to the extent consistent with the purposes of the Plan and without amending the Plan, to modify, to cancel, or to waive the Company’s rights with respect to any Awards, to adjust or to modify Award Agreements for changes in Applicable Law, and to recognize differences in foreign law, tax policies, or customs;

^^^to require, as a condition precedent to the grant, vesting, exercise, settlement, and/or issuance of Shares pursuant to any Award, that a Participant agree to execute a general release of claims (in any form that the Committee may require, in its sole discretion, which form may include any other provisions, e.g. confidentiality and restrictions on competition, that are found in general claims release agreements that the Company utilizes or expects to utilize);

^^^in the event that the Company establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated system for the documentation, granting, settlement, or exercise of Award, such as a system using an internet website or interactive voice response, to implement paperless documentation, granting, settlement, or exercise of Awards by a Participant may be permitted through the use of such an automated system; and

^^^to make all interpretations and to take all other actions that the Committee may consider necessary or advisable to administer the Plan or to effectuate its purposes.

Subject to Applicable Law and the restrictions set forth in the Plan, the Committee may delegate administrative functions to individuals who are Directors or Employees.

^^Local Law Adjustments and Sub-plans. To facilitate the making of any grant of an Award under this Plan, the Committee may adopt rules and provide for such special terms for Awards to Participants who are foreign nationals or who are employed by the Company or any Affiliate outside of the United States of America as the Committee may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company is specifically authorized to adopt rules and procedures regarding the conversion of local currency, taxes, withholding procedures and handling of stock certificates which vary with th e customs and requirements of particular countries. The Company may adopt sub-plans and establish escrow accounts and trusts, and settle Awards in cash in lieu of shares, as may be appropriate, required or applicable to particular locations and countries.

^^Action by Committee. Unless otherwise established by the Board or in any charter of the Committee, a majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, and acts approved in writing by all members of the Committee in lieu of a meeting, shall be deemed the acts of the Committee. Each member of the Committee is entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to that member by an officer or other employee of the Company or any Affiliate, the Company’s independent certified public accounts, or any executive compensatio n consultant or other professional retained by the Company to assist in the administration of the Plan.

^^Deference to Committee Determinations. The Committee shall have the discretion to interpret or construe ambiguous, unclear, or implied (but omitted) terms in any fashion it deems to be appropriate in its sole discretion, and to make any findings of fact needed in the administration of the Plan or Award Agreements. The Committee’s prior exercise of its discretionary authority shall not obligate it to exercise its authority in a like fashion thereafter. The Committee’s interpretation and construction of any provision of the Plan, or of any Award or Award Agreement, and all determinations the Committee makes pursuant to the Plan sha ll be final, binding, and conclusive. The validity of any such interpretation, construction, decision or finding of fact shall not be given de novo review if challenged in court, by arbitration, or in any other forum, and shall be upheld unless clearly made in bad faith or materially affected by fraud.

^^No Liability; Indemnification. Neither the Board nor any Committee member, nor any Person acting at the direction of the Board or the Committee, shall be liable for any act, omission, interpretation, construction or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement. The Company and its Affiliates shall pay or reimburse any member of the Committee, as well as any Director, Employee, or Consultant who in good faith takes action on behalf of the Plan, for all expenses incurred with respect to the Plan, and to the full extent allowable under Applicable Law shall indemnify each and every one of them for any claims, liabilities, and costs (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of their good faith performance of duties on behalf of the Plan. The Company and its Affiliates may, but shall not be required to, obtain liability insurance for this purpose.

^^Expenses**.** The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne jointly and severally by the Company and its Affiliates.

^**Modification of Awards and Substitution of Options****.** Within the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may modify an Award to accelerate the rate at which an Option may be exercised, to accelerate the vesting of any Award, to extend or renew outstanding Awards, to accept the cancellation of outstanding Awards to the extent not previously exercised, or to make any change that the Plan would permit for a new Award. However, except in connection with a Change in Control or as approved by the Company’s stockholders for any period during which it is subject to the reporting requirem ents of the Exchange Act, the Committee may not cancel an outstanding Option whose exercise price is greater than Fair Market Value at the time of cancellation for the purpose of reissuing the Option to the Participant at a lower exercise price, or granting a replacement award of a different type, or otherwise allowing for a “repricing” within the meaning of applicable federal securities laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no modification of an outstanding Award may materially and adversely affect a Participant’s rights thereunder unless either (i) the Participant provides written consent to the modification, or (ii) before a Change in Control, the Committee determines in good faith that the modification is not materially adverse to the Participant; provided, however, that no action pursuant to Section 9 shall be considered to materially or adversely affect Participant’s rights.

^**Plan Amendment and Termination**.

^^General Rules. This Plan, the granting of Awards, the exercise of Options, and the obligations of the Company hereunder (including those to pay cash or to deliver, sell or accept the surrender of any of its Shares or other securities) shall be subject to all Applicable Law. In the event that any Shares are not registered under any Applicable Law prior to the required delivery of them pursuant to Awards, the Company may require, as a condition to their issuance or de livery, that the persons to whom the Shares are to be issued or delivered make any written representations and warranties (such as that such Shares are being acquired by the Participant for investment for the Participant’s own account and not with a view to, for resale in connection with, or with an intent of participating directly or indirectly in, any distribution of such Shares) that the Committee may reasonably require, and the Committee may in its sole discretion include a legend to such effect on the certificates representing any Shares issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan.

^^Black-out Periods. Notwithstanding any contrary terms within the Plan or any Award Agreement, the Committee shall have the absolute discretion to impose a “blackout” period on the exercise of any Option, as well as the settlement of any Award, with respect to any or all Participants (including those whose Continuous Service has ended) to the extent that the Committee determines that doing so is either desirable or required in order to comply with applicable securities laws.

^**No Stockholder Rights*****.*** Neither a Participant nor any transferee or Beneficiary of a Participant shall have any rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares underlying any Award until the date of issuance of a share certificate to such Participant, transferee, or Beneficiary for such Shares in accordance with the Company’s governing instruments and Applicable Law. Prior to the issuance of Shares or Restricted Shares pursuant to an Award, a Participant shall not have the right to vote or to receive dividends or any other rights as a stock holder with respect to the Shares underlying the Award (unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement for Restricted Shares), notwithstanding its exercise in the case of Options. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right that is determined based on a record date prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Plan or an Award Agreement.
