^**Adjustments to the Number of Option Shares.**

If, at any time, the Company shall take any action, whether by stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares or otherwise, which results in a proportionate increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock theretofore issued and outstanding, the number of shares subject to this Option shall, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Committee, be increased or decreased in the same proportion, provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue fractional shares.

In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, combination or exchange of shares or other corporate change, the number of shares of Common Stock shall be adjusted in such manner and to such extent, if any, as Committee deems to be appropriate.
