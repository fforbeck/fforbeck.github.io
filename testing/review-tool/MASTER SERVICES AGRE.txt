Where applicable, Supplier shall ensure that its invoices to MetroPCS are issued in such a way that these invoices meet the requirements for deduction of input value-added tax by MetroPCS. MetroPCS shall in no event be liable for the payment of any taxes or like charges based upon the net income of Supplier. 

Long Distance MSA     

***3.3.2 Exemptions.*** Supplier shall not collect otherwise applicable taxes or like charges if a valid tax exemption certificate is furnished by MetroPCS to Supplier. If Supplier collects taxes and MetroPCS either: (a) subsequently determines that the taxes were not due; or (b) had previously issued to Supplier a valid exemption certificate or (c) MetroPCS subsequently provides a valid exemption certificate, Supplier will make all reasonable efforts to assist MetroPCS in obtaining a refund of such taxes collected in error, including, but not limited to, issuing a credit memo and/or filing a refund claim on behalf of MetroPCS if requested to do so in writing by MetroPCS. 

***3.3.3 Special Provision Relating to State Sales and Use Taxes***. If MetroPCS receives Services in the United States from Supplier and such transfer is subject to sales or use tax of a particular state in the United States, MetroPCS will reimburse Supplier for any such taxes paid by Supplier over and above the purchase price for such goods; provided, however, that MetroPCS shall not reimburse Supplier for any such taxes charged against Supplier or MetroPCS on account of Supplier’s mis-delivery or other failure to comply with MetroPCS’ delivery instructions. 

***3.3.4 Protested Taxes***. Supplier shall promptly notify MetroPCS in writing of: (a) any Tax Assessment by a state or local taxing authority; and (b) any decision with respect to a Tax Assessment which has been appealed or protested; provided, however, that Supplier shall in all instances give MetroPCS written notice of such event no later than *** prior to the date by which a response, protest, contest, or other appeal of such Tax Assessment must be filed. In the first instance, Supplier shall have the exclusive right to contest any Tax Assessment at its own expense. If all or any portion of a Tax Assessment must be paid in order to contest the imposition of any such Tax Assessment in connection with a contest that Supplier elects to pursue, or to avoid the existence of a lien on the assets of Supplier during the pendency of such contest, Supplier shall be responsible for such payment and shall be entitled to the benefit of any refund or recovery. MetroPCS shall pay all valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessments (or reimburse Supplier in the event Supplier pays any or all valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessments) upon presentation by Supplier of proof of a valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessment. MetroPCS’ liability for valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessments will be limited to the actual tax that was originally due without respect to any sampling projection that may occur during a tax audit. A “***valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessment***” shall mean one that is issued by a state or local taxing authority in accordance with the applicable Law and which is not subject to any further administrative or judicial review and all times for appeal, reconsideration, or requests for reassessment have run without an appeal, reconsideration, or request for reassessment having been taken. If Supplier elects not to contest a Tax Assessment, Supplier must either: (c) waive its right to reimbursement from MetroPCS for that Tax Assessment in which event MetroPCS shall have no right to contest the Tax Assessment and MetroPCS shall have no liability for such Tax Assessment; or (d) promptly notify MetroPCS in writing that it is: (1) not responding, protesting, contesting, or appealing the Tax Assessment; and (2) seeking reimbursement for the Tax Assessment as if it were a valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessment which notice shall set forth the legal and/or factual basis for not contesting the Tax Assessment along with a copy of the Tax Assessment; provided, however, that Supplier shall in all instances give MetroPCS written notice of such decision to not protest, contest or appeal such Tax Assessment no later than *** prior to the date by which a response, contest, protest or other appeal of such Tax Assessment must be filed; provided, further, that Supplier may not elect the option set forth in **subsection (d)** (e.g., to notify MetroPCS and not protest, contest, or appeal a Tax Assessment) unless Supplier has a good faith belief that there is no reasonable basis in Law or fact for a contest, protest, or appeal of such Tax Assessment; provided, finally, that in the event that Supplier elects the option set forth in **subsection (d)** and fails to notify MetroPCS in writing in time to allow MetroPCS to file a response, protest, or contest, Supplier shall be deemed to have waived its right to seek reimbursement from MetroPCS for that Tax Assessment. In the instance Supplier notifies MetroPCS that it is not contesting the Tax Assessment, MetroPCS may elect, at its sole discretion, to pursue the contest of the Tax Assessment in good faith, at its own expense, or to pay to Supplier the Tax Assessment. If MetroPCS elects to contest a Tax Assessment and, further, in the event that all or a portion of a Tax Assessment must be paid in order to contest the imposition of any such Tax Assessment or to avoid the existence of a lien on the assets of Supplier during the pendency of such contest, MetroPCS shall be responsible for such payment. If any such contest must be pursued in the name of Supplier, Supplier shall permit MetroPCS to pursue and control the contest in the name of Supplier, and Supplier shall have the opportunity to participate fully in the preparation of such contest at its own expense. In any contest of a Tax Assessment, the party bringing the protest shall promptly furnish the other party with written notice of the pending proceeding, copies of all filings in any proceeding, protest, contest, or legal challenge, all rulings issued in connection therewith, all correspondence between such party and the state or local taxing authority, the final resolution thereof, and any action therein that would affect Supplier’s obligation to collect and remit, and the party bringing the contest shall allow the other party to participate in such contest with its own counsel at its own expense.

This SA-1 describes the terms and conditions under which US South will provide Domestic Long Distance Service (including Extended Service), Toll Free Services and Travel Talk Services (all of the foregoing as defined in Section 1.0 of this SA-1) to MetroPCS, its Affiliates and Designated Entities. *** . All capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined, in this SA-1 shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms and Conditions. Any telecommunications-related capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined, in this SA-1 or in the Terms and Conditions shall have the meanings ascribed to them under generally applicable industry standards. 

^^**DOMESTIC LONG DISTANCE SERVICE.**

^^US South will provide to MetroPCS, its Affiliates and/or Designated Entities domestic long distance termination service for calls made by the end user subscribers of MetroPCS, its Affiliates and Designated Entities (the “***Customers***”) originating on the networks of MetroPCS, its Affiliates and/or Designated Entities *** , to the called automated number identification terminating in: (a) the contiguous forty-eight (48) states (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Guam, Hawaii and the U.S. Virgin Islands); and (b) Alaska and Puerto Rico (“***Extended Service***”) (the services described in the foregoing **subsections (a)** and (b) are collectively referred to herein as the “***Domestic Long Distance Service***”). Domestic Long Distance Service includes four (4) categories (each, a “***Category***,” and collectively, the “***Categories***”): (w) Wireless; (x) Wireless Direct; (y) MetroPCS-to-MetroPCS; and (z) other. For purposes of this SA-1, the Categories are defined as follows:

^^^The “***Wireless***” Category includes all Domestic Long Distance Service calls originated by Customers and terminated to any CMRS provider’s subscribers according to Telecordia’s Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) in the categories of “PCS” and “Wireless,” excluding MetroPCS, its Affiliates and/or Designated Entities and those wireless carriers included in the Wireless Direct Category;

^^^The “***Wireless Direct***” Category includes all calls originated by Customers and terminated to any of the wireless carriers with which US South has established direct peering relationships as set forth on the attached **Exhibit A**, as such Exhibit may be amended from time to time by US South with notice to MetroPCS,

^US South will provide Domestic Long Distance Service to MetroPCS, its Affiliates and Designated Entities in accordance with the terms of the Service Level Agreements set forth in Section 5.0 of this SA-1.

^US South agrees that calls originating via a toll free number (*i.e.*, 800, 888, 866) (the “***Toll Free Services***”) will be originated on US South’s network and transported via a dedicated facility for MetroPCS, its Affiliates and/or Designated Entities to provide call treatment or other services. Toll Free Services: (a) are limited to the contiguous forty-eight (48) states, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Canada; and (b) except for Canada, do not include international origination services.

^^**EXCLUSIVITY; PARTIES’ AUDIT RIGHTS.**

^^**MetroPCS International Long Distance Traffic Routing Requirements.**

^^MetroPCS shall deliver to US South for termination during the SA-2 Term at least: *** (“***Percentage of Delivered ILD Calls***”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following international long distance calls generated by the Customers will be excluded from any calculations to determine compliance with the Percentage of Delivered ILD Calls: (i) calls made by Customers during a Transition Period (if any); (ii) calls made by Customers during any period that a Force Majeure Event prevents, hinders or delays US South from providing International Long Distance Service; (iii) calls made by customers of a Person that becomes an Affiliate or Designated Entity of MetroPCS following the SA-2 Effective Date; and (iv) calls made by Customers to a Particular Destination that is excluded from such calculation under the terms of Section 3.01(b).

US South shall implement the Additional Carrier no later than *** after its receipt of MetroPCS’ written notice; provided, however, that for a period of *** following implementation of such Additional Carrier (the “***Trial Period***”), any calls terminated by such Additional Carrier shall not be: (i) *** ; or (ii) *** ; provided that MetroPCS shall pay US South *** . Within *** after commencement of the Trial Period, MetroPCS and US South shall meet (in person or telephonically) to review the performance of the Additional Carrier and, based upon such performance, determine whether to retain or remove the Additional Carrier for purposes of terminating Customers’ calls to the Particular Destination. If the parties agree to retain the Additional Carrier, the parties will further mutually determine whether calls terminated by such Additional Carrier will be subject to the SLAs and, if so, whether to implement any revisions or amendments to the SLAs as a result of the retention of the Additional Carrier. If MetroPCS wants to remove the Additional Carrier from the MetroPCS Destination Schedule, then such Additional Carrier shall be removed from the MetroPCS Destination Schedule, and MetroPCS shall not terminate any International Long Distance Service calls to the Particular Destination through such Additional Carrier for a period of *** following the date on which MetroPCS removes the Additional Carrier from the MetroPCS Destination Schedule. If MetroPCS wants to retain the Additional Carrier but US South does not want to retain the Additional Carrier, then the Additional Carrier shall be removed from the MetroPCS Destination Schedule and the Particular Destination thereafter shall be excluded from calculation of the Percentage of Delivered ILD Calls.
