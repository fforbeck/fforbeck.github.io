^If the Secured Parties exercise their rights under the Pledge Agreement after a default on the Notes by the Company, resulting in a loss by 2020 Energy of all or any portion the Pledged Shares, the Company is willing to reimburse 2020 Energy by issuing new shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $[[USD Value 1: Number]] per share (the “**Common Stock**”) to 2020 Energy to replace the Pledged Shares.
