Section 1.3. **Term and Territory**. The licenses granted hereby shall be in perpetuity so long as this Agreement has not been terminated by its terms (the “Term”) and shall apply throughout the world (the “Territory”). In the event the Term terminates, VPG agrees that within twenty-four (24) months thereafter, VPG will change its corporate name so as not to include the term VISHAY.

Section 1.4. **Rights in VPG**. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement shall not restrict VPG from using the acronym “VPG” in any Name, or in any Mark, so long as such Name or Mark does not contain VISHAY (except as otherwise permitted pursuant hereto).

VPG shall be permitted to use any document number on data sheets, package drawings, instructions or other materials posted to the internet (each a “Document Number”) or any SKU number, part number, or other number and/or letter sequence printed on or identified with any part (each a “Part Number”) on or in connection with VPG Products and Services, so long as such Document Number or Part Number does not contain the prefix or suffix VSH.

Section 1.6. **VPG Acknowledgement**. VPG acknowledges and agrees that: (i) VSH is the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Marks; (ii) all goodwill associated with the Licensed Marks shall inure to the sole and exclusive benefit of VSH; and (iii) nothing in this Agreement or any related agreement, instrument or document shall be construed to give VPG any legal or beneficial ownership interest in or title to the Licensed Marks.

^^During the Term, and subject to section 1.8(e), VSH shall not, under a Mark or Name which includes the term VISHAY immediately followed by the term PRECISION: (i) directly or indirectly, design, develop, manufacture, market or provide any products, except to the extent such usage exists (and limited to those products with respect to which such usage exists) immediately following the Effective Date; or (ii) use such Mark or Name in connection with any aspect of its business, operations or affairs, whether conducted directly or indirectly, and whether or not such usage would otherwise require permission of VPG, except to the extent such usage is not otherwise prohibited by clause (i) of this paragraph. Without limitation, the foregoing restriction shall apply to the legal name or fictitious name (“d/b/a”) of any subsidiary of VSH or any other entity under the control of VSH.

^^During the Term, VSH shall not, under a Mark or Name which includes the acronym “VPG”: (i) directly or indirectly, design, develop, manufacture, market or provide any products that overlap (i.e. compete) with any products within the product range of VPG or any of its subsidiaries as constituted immediately following the Effective Date; or (ii) use such acronym in connection with any aspect of its business, operations or affairs, whether conducted directly or indirectly, and whether or not such usage would otherwise require permission of VPG, except to the extent such usage is not otherwise prohibited by clause (i) of this paragraph. Without limitation, the foregoing restriction shall apply to the legal name or fictitious name (“d/b/a”) of any subsidiary of VSH or any other entity under the control of VSH.

^^During the Term, except as otherwise permitted pursuant to this Agreement, VPG shall not, under a Mark or Name which includes the term VISHAY INTERTECHNOLOGY or VISHAY, or under the acronym VSH: (i) directly or indirectly, design, develop, manufacture, market or provide any products that overlap (i.e. compete) with any products within the product range of VSH or any of its subsidiaries as constituted immediately following the Effective Date; or (ii) use such Mark, Name or acronym in connection with any aspect of its business, operations or affairs, whether conducted directly or indirectly, and whether or not such usage would require permission of VSH, unless the term VISHAY is immediately followed by the term PRECISION (so long as the term PRECISION has no less prominence than the term VISHAY and such Name does not include the term VISHAY together with the term INTERTECHNOLOGY), except to the extent such usage is not otherwise prohibited by clause (i) of this paragraph.

^^For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 1.8 shall be construed to impose any restriction on the right of VSH to use the term PRECISION in a descriptive manner (but not as a Mark or Name) in connection with the design, development, manufacture, marketing, provision or performance of any goods or services, so long as the term PRECISION does not immediately follow the term VISHAY. A non-exhaustive, representative list of descriptive uses of the term PRECISION permissible by VSH, in marketing materials, engineering documents, data handbooks and packaging and similar materials, is shown on Schedule C.

^ADDITIONAL MARKS; REGISTRATION OF MARKS; ENFORCEMENT

Section 3.1. **Additional Licensed Marks**. If VPG proposes to use any Mark or Name containing VISHAY that is not on Schedule A, prior to such use, VPG shall notify VSH in advance in writing, unless the term PRECISION immediately follows the term VISHAY in such Mark or Name (with the term PRECISION having no less prominence than the term VISHAY) and such Mark or Name does not include the term VISHAY together with the term INTERTECHNOLOGY. If VSH does not object in writing within thirty (30) business days after receipt of such notice, VSH shall be deemed to have approved the use of such Mark for the VPG Products and Services only, such Mark shall be deemed to be a Licensed Mark and such Mark shall be added to Schedule A. If VSH shall object to the use of a Mark by VPG, the parties shall resolve their dispute with respect to such objection in accordance with the resolution procedures referred to in Section 5.16. During the Term, VPG shall be permitted to use any Mark or Name in which the term VISHAY is immediately followed by the term PRECISION (so long as the term PRECISION has no less prominence than the term VISHAY and such Mark or Name does not contain the term VISHAY together with the term INTERTECHNOLOGY), on or in connection with the VPG Products and Services, without the need to seek consent to such use by VSH, and upon notification by VPG to VSH of any such use, such Mark or Name shall be added to Schedule A.

Section 3.1. **Registration of Licensed Marks**. At VPG’s reasonable request and expense, VSH shall: (i) take all reasonably necessary steps to procure registration of any of the Licensed Marks for the VPG Products and Services; and (ii) maintain any and all such registrations in full force and effect during the Term so long as such Licensed Mark is being used by VPG, and VPG shall, at its sole expense, cooperate with VSH in connection with the forgoing. VPG shall not seek to register any of the Licensed Marks or any similar Marks, unless authorized by VSH in writing, and such registration shall be held by VPG on behalf of VSH.

Section 3.2. **Domain Names**. VSH hereby licenses to, and approves of the use by VPG of the internet domain names containing the term VISHAY listed on Schedule D (“Licensed Domain Names”). VPG agrees that, in securing the registration of such domain names, it has acted as agent of VSH. If VPG proposes to secure the registration of any additional domain name containing the term VISHAY, it shall notify VSH in advance in writing, unless the term PRECISION immediately follows the term VISHAY in such domain name and such domain name does not include the term VISHAY together with the term INTERTECHNOLOGY. If VSH does not object in writing within thirty (30) business days after receipt of such notice, VSH shall be deemed to have approved VPG’s registration of such any such domain name, such domain name shall be deemed to be a Licensed Domain Name and such domain name shall be added to Schedule D. If VSH shall object to the registration of a domain name by VPG, the parties shall resolve their dispute with respect to such objection in accordance with the resolution procedures referred to in Section 5.16. Without the written consent of VSH, under no circumstances shall VPG transfer or assign the registration of any Licensed Domain

Name to any person other than a wholly-owned subsidiary without the written consent of VSH or any other person to whom VPG is permitted to assign sublicense or otherwise transfer its rights under this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.5.

Section 3.3. **Display of Marks**. The parties agree that it is in their mutual best interest that, and shall cooperate so that, subject to Section 1.2, the Licensed Marks utilized by VPG shall appear distinctive from Marks utilized by VSH, and the Marks utilized by VSH shall appear distinctive from the Licensed Marks utilized by VPG. Any dispute with respect to the appearance of a Licensed Mark or a VSH Mark shall be resolved in accordance with the resolution procedures referred to in Section 5.16.

Section 3.4. **Legal Notices**. VPG shall, to the extent commercially practicable, place appropriate notices (e.g. ® or ™) to designate the Licensed Marks as trademarks or service marks.

Section 3.5. **Enforcement**.  

^^VPG shall, at its own reasonable expense, cooperate fully and promptly with VSH in the protection of VSH’s rights in the Licensed Marks, in such manner and to such extent as VSH may reasonably request.

^^Each party shall promptly advise the other party in writing of any actual or potential infringement, or any other unauthorized use of or violation of any of the Licensed Marks of which it becomes aware (each an “Infringement”). VSH may take such action as it, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable to stop any Infringement. VPG may request in writing that VSH institute an action to stop an Infringement. If VSH receives such a written request and does not institute such action within thirty (30) days, VPG shall be entitled to institute such action as it deems necessary or advisable to stop the Infringement, in which VSH shall be entitled to join. The party not taking the lead in any action shall cooperate fully with the other party at the other party’s reasonable request and expense.

^^Any monetary recovery or sums obtained in settlement of any action to stop an Infringement shall be allocated between VSH and VPG as shall be fair and equitable, taking into account their actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, and the damages sustained by each of them. Any dispute with respect to the allocation of recoveries shall be resolved in accordance with the resolution procedures referred to in Section 5.16.

Section 5.3. **Relationship of the Parties**. This Agreement shall not be construed to place the parties in the relationship of legal representatives, partners, joint venturers or agents of or with each other. No party shall have any power to obligate or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever, except as specifically provided herein.

Section 5.4. **Third Party Beneficiaries**. Except for the indemnification rights under this Agreement of any Indemnified Parties (as hereafter defined), the provisions of this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and are not intended to confer upon any person, except the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 5.5. **Assignment and Sublicense**.  

^^The license shall be assignable or sublicenseable to any direct or indirect Majority Owned Subsidiary of VPG, provided that VPG shall be responsible for the compliance by any such Majority Owned Subsidiary with the terms of this Agreement. As used herein, “Majority Owned Subsidiary of VPG” means any subsidiary of VPG (x) of which both over [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the voting securities and over [[Percentage 1]]% of the outstanding equity interests, whether voting or non-voting, are owned by VPG or by one or more of Majority-Owned Subsidiaries of VPG or by VPG and one or more of its Majority-Owned Subsidiaries, and (y) which is engaged in the design, development, manufacture, marketing, provision and performance of VPG Products and Services as part of the business of VPG under the management and control of VPG.

^^If VPG shall sell or transfer its business of the design, development, manufacture, marketing, provision and performance of VPG Products and Services substantially as an entirety, to a single purchaser or other single transferee, whether such sale or other transfer is structured as a sale of stock, assets or otherwise, and thereafter VPG shall cease to be engaged in such business, the purchaser or other transferee shall succeed to the rights and obligations of VPG under this Agreement; provided such purchaser or other transferee shall execute documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to VSH agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the following actions shall not be deemed an assignment, delegation or other transfer of VPG’s rights, benefits, powers, duties, responsibilities or obligations under this Agreement or the license granted hereby or any interest therein: (1) assignment or transfer of the stock of VPG, including by way of a merger, consolidation, or other form of reorganization in which outstanding shares of VPG are exchanged for securities, or (2) any transaction effected primarily for the purpose of (A) changing VPG’s state of incorporation or (B) reorganizing VPG into a holding company structure such that, as a result of any such transaction, VPG becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company owned by the holders of VPG’s securities immediately prior to such transaction.

^^Except as provided in this Section, the license granted hereby shall be non-assignable and non- sublicenseable. Any purported license or assignment in violation of this Agreement shall be void.

^^This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 5.6. **Press Releases; Public Announcements**. Neither party shall issue any release or make any other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written approval of the other party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, however, that either party shall be permitted to make any release or public announcement that in the opinion of its counsel it is required to make by law or the rules of any national securities exchange of which its securities are listed; provided further that it has made efforts that are reasonable in the circumstances to obtain the prior approval of the other party.

Section 5.7. **Waiver of Defaults**. Waiver by any party hereto of any default by the other party hereto of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver by the waiving party of any subsequent or other default, nor shall it in any way affect the validity of this Agreement or prejudice the rights of the other party thereafter to enforce each and ever such provision. No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

Section 5.8. **Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, as the case may be, is not affected in any manner adverse to any party hereto or thereto. Upon such determination, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable provision to effect the original intent of the parties hereto.

Section 5.9. **Indemnification**. Each of the parties shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, each of its respective current and former directors, officers and employees, and each of their respective heirs, executors, successors and assigns (“Indemnified

All indemnification procedures and payments shall be governed by Sections 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 of the Master Separation Agreement between the parties, dated [[Date 5: Date]] (the “Master Separation Agreement”), as applicable.

Section 5.10. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**. IN NO EVENT SHALL VSH OR VPG BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, COLLATERAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS OR FAILURE TO REALIZE EXPECTED SAVINGS OR OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS OF ANY KIND, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT LIMIT EITHER PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

Section 5.11. **Confidential Information**. VSH and VPG shall hold and shall cause each of their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors and other representatives to hold, in strict confidence and not to disclose or release without the prior written consent of the other party, any and all proprietary or confidential information, material or data of the other party that comes into its possession in connection with the performance by the parties of their rights and obligations under this Agreement.

Each of the parties irrevocably waives any objection to venue in the federal and state courts located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.15. **Specific Performance**. The parties hereto agree that the remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement may be inadequate, and that any party hereto shall be entitled to specific performance in addition to any other appropriate relief or remedy, if and to the extent that the remedy of specific performance is available in accordance with Section 8.2(g) of the Master Separation Agreement.
