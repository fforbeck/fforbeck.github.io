Magen shall have a period of [*] ([*]) days to review such [[ and ]] Information regarding the Follow-On Compound, and to exercise such Follow-On Option. If Magen exercises the Follow-On Option, then the Parties shall immediately enter into licensing negotiations regarding such Follow-On Compound and shall seek diligently and in good faith to agree on the commercially reasonable terms of and to execute a separate licensing agreement covering the license to Magen of such Follow-On Compound in the Field, by the date that is [*] ([*]) days after such exercise. [[ and ]] may not license any Follow-On Compound to a Third Party in the Field without first providing to Magen the Follow-On Option covering such Follow-On Compound and complying with the above procedures. With respect to any such Follow-On Option provided by [[ and ]], if: (i) [[ and ]] receives written notice from Magen that it does not want to license the applicable Follow-On Compound, or (ii) Magen does not exercise such Follow-On Option within the above [*] day exercise period, or (iii) the Parties fail to successfully negotiate and execute a licensing agreement for the Follow-On Compound, in the case Magen has exercised such Follow-On Option, then [[ and ]] shall be free to license the applicable Follow-On Compound to a Third Party, *provided that* such terms are no less favorable to [[ and ]] than those refused by Magen. 

^^**Covenant Not to Sue**. During the term of this Agreement, [[ and ]] covenants that it will make no claim nor commence or prosecute against Magen any suit, action or proceeding of any kind based upon assertion of infringement of any claim of any issued patent owned or licensed by [[ and ]] to the extent that such claim covers a Licensed Compound or Licensed Product.

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

^^Magen shall pay royalties due under this Section 4.3 concurrently with the remittance of the royalty report in accordance with Section 4.4. For sales of a particular Licensed Product in a particular country (or jurisdiction), royalties shall be owed and payable under this Section 4.3 for such sales during the Royalty Term applicable to such Licensed Product in such country (or jurisdiction). 

^^The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the [[ and ]] Patents and [[ and ]] Know-How licensed pursuant to this Agreement justify royalties of differing amounts with respect to sales of the Licensed Product, which royalties could be applied separately to the Licensed Product involving the exercise of such [[ and ]] Patents and/or the incorporation of such [[ and ]] Know-How, and that if such royalties were calculated separately, royalties relating to the [[ and ]] Patents and royalties relating to the [[ and ]] Know-How would last for different terms. In light of such considerations and for reasons of convenience, the Parties have hereby determined that blended royalty rates for the [[ and ]] Patents and the Lily Know-How licensed hereunder will apply during a single Royalty Term and that the utilization of such blended royalty rates is advantageous to both Parties. 

^^**Record Retention, Royalty Reports, and Royalty Payment Schedule.** Magen shall keep (and shall cause its Affiliates and require its sublicensees to keep) complete and accurate books and records that are necessary to ascertain and verify royalty payments owed under Section 4.3. Such records shall be kept in accordance with GAAP and Magen’s or its Permitted Sellers internal practices and procedures, consistently applied. Magen shall furnish [[ and ]] with a quarterly report on Net Sales of Licensed Product occurring in each particular Calendar Quarter, within [*] ([*]) days after the end of the Calendar Quarter. Such report shall include a written report detailing: (i) the Net Sales of Licensed Products for the previous Calendar Quarter, broken down by country and between Magen and any Permitted Sellers, (ii) the royalty payment that is due and payable for the Net Sales in such Calendar Quarter, and (iii) the basis for calculating such royalty payment. Magen will mail such reports to the attention of: Eli [[ and ]] and Company, [[ and ]] Royalty Administration in Finance, Drop Code 1063, [[ and ]] Corporate Center, [[Address 3: Address]], 46285. The amount of royalty payment due to [[ and ]] shall be paid by Magen concurrently with the remittance of each royalty report (that is, within [*] ([*]) days of the end of each Calendar Quarter). All amounts payable to [[ and ]] under this Article 4 shall be paid in U.S. dollars by electronic wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by [[ and ]] (unless otherwise instructed by [[ and ]] in writing). 

^^**Audits.** [[ and ]] will have the right, during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to have such books and records of Magen described in Section 4.4 audited no more than [*] per calendar year so as to verify the accuracy of the information previously reported to [[ and ]] under Section 4.4. Any such audit shall be conducted by an independent certified public accounting firm of national standing selected by [[ and ]] and approved by Magen (which firm may be Magen’s independent certified public accounting firm), such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Such audit may cover the period back to the beginning of two (2) full calendar years preceding the date of the request for such audit and may not cover any prior period. [[ and ]] may audit a given period of sales [*]. Such audit right shall continue for [*] ([*]) calendar years following expiration or termination of the Agreement. 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

Such accountants will keep confidential any information obtained during such audit and will report to [[ and ]] only their conclusions. The cost of such audit will be borne by [*]; however, if as a result of such audit the Parties agree that the actual amount of royalties owed to [[ and ]], for the period audited, is more than the amount of royalties paid by Magen for the period that is the subject of the audit by greater than [*] percent ([*]%) of such amount owed, then the cost of the audit will be borne by Magen. Within [*] ([*]) days after both Parties have received a copy of an audit report, Magen or [[ and ]], as appropriate, will compensate the other Party for payment errors or omissions revealed by the audit. Magen will include in all sublicenses granted in accordance herewith, and any other agreements enabling a Third Person to be a Permitted Seller, an audit provision substantially similar to the foregoing requiring such Permitted Seller to keep full and accurate books and records relating to the Licensed Product and granting [[ and ]] the right to have an independent public accounting firm audit the accuracy of the information reported by the sublicensee in connection therewith. 

^^Taxes And Currency. All payments made under this Agreement shall be in United States dollars. Any and all taxes levied on any payments by Magen under this Agreement shall be the liability of and paid by [[ and ]] If laws or regulations require the withholding of such taxes, the taxes will be deducted by Magen from the payment and remitted by Magen to the proper tax authority, provided that Magen will furnish [[ and ]] with a copy of the official tax receipt on such withholdings as soon as practicable after such withholding, and give [[ and ]] such assistance, at [[ and ]]’s expense, as may be reasonably necessary to enable or assist [[ and ]] to claim exemption or take credit therefrom. Proof of payment shall be provided to [[ and ]] within [*] ([*]) days after payment. Magen will cooperate, at [[ and ]]’s expense, in pursuing tax refunds, if such refund is appropriate in [[ and ]]’s determination. 

^^Late Payment. Any amounts not paid by Magen when due under this Agreement will be subject to interest from and including the date payment is due through and including the date upon which [[ and ]] has collected the funds in accordance herewith at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) the sum of [*] percent ([*]%) plus the United States prime rate of interest quoted in the Money Rates (or equivalent) section of the *Wall Street Journal* per annum, calculated daily on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year, or (ii) the maximum interest rate allowed by law. 

\centered INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS 

^^Prosecution and Maintenance of [[ and ]] Patents. 

^^[[ and ]] shall be responsible for the preparation, prosecution and maintenance of all the [[ and ]] Patents (collectively, ***“Patent Responsibilities”***) under this Agreement. During such efforts, [[ and ]] shall be obligated to provide Magen copies of all documents proposed to be filed with a patent office (reasonably in advance of such filing) and all correspondence with any patent office (including office actions and the like) relating to such efforts, to consult with Magen, and to reasonably incorporate Magen’s comments with respect to matters related to prosecution and maintenance of the [[ and ]] Patents, insofar as the prosecution and maintenance of the [[ and ]] Patents may reasonably be considered to affect Magen’s development and commercial interests described herein. 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

^^If [[ and ]] may determine that it no longer desires to fulfill the Patent Responsibilities for any of the [[ and ]] Patents under this Agreement or if [[ and ]] decides to allow any [[ and ]] Patent to lapse or desires to abandon or discontinue prosecution of any [[ and ]] Patent, [[ and ]] shall promptly so notify Magen, and in such case, at [[ and ]]’s sole discretion, either (i) Magen shall thereafter assume such Patent Responsibilities (except as otherwise provided below) as Magen desires with respect to the affected [[ and ]] Patent(s) or (ii) [[ and ]] shall assign the [[ and ]] Patents to Magen (in which case Magen shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to prosecute, maintain and enforce such assigned Patents). Further, if Magen reasonably believes that [[ and ]] is prosecuting any [[ and ]] Patent in a manner that negatively affects Magen’s development and commercial interests, or that [[ and ]]’s inaction is likely to result in the abandonment of any [[ and ]] Patent(s), then, upon Magen’s request, [[ and ]] shall transfer the Patent Responsibilities for such [[ and ]] Patent(s) to Magen or, in [[ and ]]’s sole discretion assign such [[ and ]] Patents to Magen. When Magen assumes any Patent Responsibilities or upon an assignment of the [[ and ]] Patents, [[ and ]] shall provide Magen with all Information and documents concerning the patent portfolio as shall be necessary or helpful to Magen in assuming such Patent Responsibilities or assignment. If [[ and ]] determines to have Magen undertake the Patent Responsibilities, [[ and ]] will irrevocably designate and appoint Magen and its duly authorized officers and agents as [[ and ]]’s agent and attorney-in-fact with respect to the [[ and ]] Patents for which [[ and ]] has transferred Patent Responsibilities to Magen, to act for and in [[ and ]]’s behalf to execute, deliver and file any and all documents with the same legal force and effect as if executed by [[ and ]] 

^^During the period when Magen is assuming the Patent Responsibilities, Magen shall, within [*] ([*]) days after each calendar year, provide [[ and ]] with a written report describing the status of all [[ and ]] Patents, including the patent country, patent and application numbers, filing date, issue date, expiration date, and any other relevant information reasonably requested by [[ and ]] Such report shall be mailed to Eli [[ and ]] and Company, Deputy/Patent General Counsel, Drop Code 1104, [[ and ]] Corporate Center, [[Address 3: Address]], 46285. 

^^If, after Magen assumes the Patent Responsibilities, Magen decides to allow any [[ and ]] Patent to lapse or wishes to abandon or discontinue prosecution of any [[ and ]] Patent, Magen shall notify [[ and ]] in writing not less than [*] ([*]) days prior to taking such action, and [[ and ]] shall have the right to assume the responsibility for such [[ and ]] Patents. If [[ and ]] does so, then Magen shall surrender to [[ and ]] its rights under Article 2 under the patent or patent application in the country or countries so affected, and [[ and ]] may assume control of the same at [[ and ]]’s sole expense (it being understood that all other rights under the license to such [[ and ]] Patent in other countries and to all other [[ and ]] Patents under Article 2 continue). 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

^^Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights. Magen and [[ and ]] will promptly notify the other of any infringement or suspected infringement that may come to its notice of any intellectual property rights relating to the Licensed Products, including, without limitation, the [[ and ]] Patents and [[ and ]] Know-How, and will provide the other Party with information with respect thereto. If a Third Person infringes or misappropriates any [[ and ]] Patent or [[ and ]] Know-How, Magen (or its Affiliate or sublicensee) will have the first right (but not the obligation), at its own expense, to pursue any and all injunctive relief, and any or all compensatory and other remedies and relief (collectively, ***“Remedies”***), against such Third Person, and [[ and ]] will have the right to participate in such action at its own expense. Should Magen determine not to pursue Remedies with respect to any such infringement or misappropriation of [[ and ]] Patents or [[ and ]] Know-How within [*] ([*]) days after receipt of written notice from [[ and ]] requesting Magen to do so, then [[ and ]] will have the right (but not the obligation), at its own expense, to pursue Remedies against such Third Person, and Magen shall have the right to participate in such action at its own expense. 

^^Assistance and Cooperation. If a Party pursues Remedies hereunder with respect to infringement or misappropriation of [[ and ]] Patents or [[ and ]] Know-How, the other Party will use all reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with the Party pursuing such Remedies, including joining in any action or providing a power of attorney if necessary. Each Party will bear its own costs and expenses relating to such pursuit. Any damages or other amounts collected will be distributed, first, to the Party that pursued Remedies to cover its costs and expenses; and second, to the other Party to cover its costs and expenses, if any, relating to the pursuit of such Remedies; and any remaining amount will be distributed to the Party that pursued the Remedies, provided that any recovery by Magen attributable to lost sales of Licensed Product shall be deemed Net Sales under this Agreement, occurring at the time such recovery is received by Magen. 

^^Settlement of Litigation. No settlement, consent judgment or other final disposition of an action for infringement or validity may be entered into as to any [[ and ]] Patent or [[ and ]] Know-How without [[ and ]]’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

^^Infringement of Third Person Rights. If a Third Person institutes a patent, trade secret or other infringement suit against Magen or a Permitted Seller during the term of this Agreement, alleging that the manufacture, marketing, sale, use or importation of a Licensed Product infringes one or more patent or other intellectual property rights held by such Third Person, then Magen (or its Affiliate or sublicensee, as applicable) will have the sole right (but not the obligation), at [*] expense, to assume direction and control of the defense of such claims. [[ and ]] will use all reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with Magen in Magen’s defense of the claims, including providing a power of attorney if necessary. Magen will not have the right to settle or otherwise dispose of any such claim in a manner that materially negatively impacts [[ and ]]’s interest in the [[ and ]] Patents without the consent of [[ and ]], which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. 

^^Magen Technology. Magen will be the sole and exclusive owner of the Magen Technology, with the sole rights, at its discretion, to seek to obtain Patents and other applicable intellectual property protection covering any such Magen Technology, at it expense.

The failure of an Indemnitee to give notice in the manner provided herein will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article 9, except to the extent that such failure to give notice materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such claim. 

^^**Defense of Action.** In case any action that is subject to indemnification under this Article 8 shall be brought against an Indemnitee and it shall give written notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate and, if it so desires, to assume the defense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee.
