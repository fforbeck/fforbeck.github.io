RE: Investment Advisory Services on behalf of The Film Department Holdings, Inc. 

Dear Mr. Gill:  

Girard Securities, Inc. (“Girard”, “us” or “we”) is pleased to act as financial advisor for The Film Department Holdings, Inc. (the “Company” or “TFD”) for a period of six months following the effective date of the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) to be co-managed by Girard. Such financial advisory services to the Company will include: (i) evaluating and advising on a continuing basis following the IPO, the Company’s financial condition and capital structure, and (ii) assisting and advising the Company in connection with proposed corporate acquisitions as well as future debt and equity financings to finance such acquisitions or for general corporate purposes. The purpose of this letter agreement is to memorialize the terms of our engagement by the Company. 

^Transaction Summary. During the term of this engagement, as defined in Section 4, Girard will serve as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the matters set forth above. 

^Information Provided to Girard In connection with our engagement, the Company has agreed to furnish to Girard, on a timely basis following the effective date of the IPO, with all relevant information needed by Girard to perform under the terms of this letter agreement. During our engagement, it may be necessary for us to (i) interview the management of, the auditors for, and the consultants and advisors to the Company; (ii) rely (without independent verification) upon data furnished to us by them; and (iii) review any financial and other reports relating to the business and financial condition of the Company as we may determine to be relevant to our advisory services. In this connection, the Company will make available to us such information as we may request, including information with respect to the assets, liabilities, earnings, earning power, financial condition, historical performance, future prospects and financial projections and the assumptions used in the development of such projections of the Company. We agree that all nonpublic information obtained by us in connection with our engagement will be held by us in strict confidence and will be used by us solely for the purpose of performing our obligations relating to our engagement. 

We do not assume any responsibility for, or with respect to, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information and data supplied to us by the Company or its representatives. In addition, the Company acknowledges that we will assume, without independent verification, that all information supplied to us with respect to the Company will be true, correct and complete in all material respects and will not contain any untrue statements of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the information supplied to us not misleading. If at any time during the course of our engagement the Company becomes aware of any material change in any of the information previously furnished to us, it will promptly advise us of the change or furnish us with additional information. 

^^^^^ 
^Scope of Engagement. Girard has been engaged by the Company only in connection with the IPO (for which we are being compensated separately pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement to be entered into in connection with the IPO) and the matters described in this letter agreement, and for no other purpose. We have not made, and will assume no responsibility to make any representation in connection with our engagement as to any legal matter. Except as specifically provided in this letter agreement, Girard shall not be required to render any advice or reports in writing or to perform any other services to the Company. 

^Term of Engagement. We will act as the Company’s financial advisor for a period of six months from the effective date of the IPO. 

^Compensation. As compensation for our advisory services, the Company will issue to us on the effective date of the IPO, or as soon as practicable thereafter, warrants to purchase [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of common stock (“Warrants”) exercisable at [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the IPO price of our shares of common stock. The Warrants will be exercisable commencing six months from the effective date of the IPO and for a period of four and one half years thereafter. The Warrants will not be assignable except to officers and directors of Girard. The Warrants will include a one-time right to require the underlying shares to be registered for resale on Form S-3, subject to customary terms and conditions, and customary piggyback registration rights as generally contained in underwriting warrants issued in connection with public offerings of securities.
