This Settlement Agreement dated as of [[Date 1: Date]] (the “Agreement”) is entered into by and among Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. (“Holdings”), Cooper-Standard Automotive Inc. (“CSA”) and Cooper-Standard Automotive Canada Limited (“CSA Canada,” and together with Holdings and CSA, “Defendants”), the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Holdings et al. (the “Creditors’ Committee”) and Cooper Tire & Rubber Company (“Plaintiff,” and together with Defendants and the Creditors’ Committee, the “Parties”). 

WHEREAS, on [[Date 2: Date]], Plaintiff, Cooper Tyre & Rubber Company UK Limited (“Cooper Tyre UK” and, together with Plaintiff, the “Sellers”) and CSA Acquisition Corp. (n/k/a Holdings), entered into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), as amended on [[Date 3: Date]], pursuant to which Holdings acquired (the “Acquisition”) the capital stock of CSA and certain other companies listed therein (the “Sold Companies”) on [[Date 4: Date]] (the “Closing Date”); 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, in addition to the Final Purchase Price (as defined therein) paid at or about the time of the Acquisition, Holdings is obligated to remit to the Sellers certain tax refunds attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date; 

WHEREAS, the value of the Sold Companies has diminished significantly since the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement, and, as a result of such diminution in value, Holdings asserts that the amount of the tax refunds required to be remitted exceeds the value of the Sold Companies held by Holdings and that Holdings is financially unable to remit such tax refunds in the amount required by the Stock Purchase Agreement; 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Plaintiff is obligated to indemnify Holdings and its affiliates for all taxes imposed on or payable with respect to the Sold Companies and their direct and indirect majority or wholly-owned subsidiaries attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date; 

WHEREAS, on [[Date 5: Date]], Holdings and each of its direct and indirect wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries (collectively with Holdings, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors’ Chapter 11 Cases (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) are being jointly administered under Case No. 09-12743 (PJW); 

WHEREAS, on [[Date 6: Date]], CSA Canada, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CSA, sought relief under the Companies’ Creditors’ Arrangement Act (“CCAA”) in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (the “Canadian Court”) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (the “CCAA Proceeding”); 

WHEREAS, on [[Date 7: Date]], Plaintiff filed the adversary proceeding, captioned Cooper Tire & Rubber Company v. Cooper-Standard Holdings, Inc. et al, Adv. Proc. No. 09-52014 (PJW) (the “Cooper Tire Adversary Proceeding”), against Holdings and CSA seeking payment of an income tax refund received by CSA Canada in the approximate amount of CAD $[[USD Value 2: Number]] million from the Canada Revenue Agency (the “Canadian Tax Refund”) and, among other things, a declaratory judgment that the Canadian Tax Refund and any additional income tax refunds received by CSA Canada from the Ontario provincial government (the “Anticipated Canadian Tax Refund,” and together with the Canadian Tax Refund, the “Tax Refunds”) is property of Plaintiff pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement; 

WHEREAS, on [[Date 8: Date]], the Canadian Court in the CCAA Proceeding issued an order (the “Canadian Tax Order”) (i) lifting the stay in the CCAA Proceeding so that Plaintiff could commence proceedings against CSA Canada in the Bankruptcy Court and (ii) requiring that CSA Canada segregate any forthcoming tax refunds until further order of the Canadian Court; 

WHEREAS, on [[Date 9: Date]], Plaintiff filed an amended complaint in the Cooper Tire Adversary Proceeding adding CSA Canada as a defendant in the proceedings; 

WHEREAS, on [[Date 10: Date]], Plaintiff and Defendants each filed a motion for summary judgment in the Cooper Tire Adversary Proceeding, and the Creditors’ Committee filed a memorandum in support of Defendants’ motion; 

WHEREAS, by letter dated [[Date 11: Date]], the Bankruptcy Court advised the parties in the Cooper Tire Adversary Proceeding that it intended to schedule a trial on the merits;

WHEREAS, the Parties believe that the terms of this Agreement and the compromise and settlement embodied herein are fair and reasonable and are in the best interest of each of the Parties. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each of the Parties hereby agrees as follows: 

^Payment of Cash Consideration. Within three (3) business days of the entry of an order authorizing and approving this Agreement becoming a final order no longer subject to appeal (the “Settlement Effective Date”), Defendants shall pay to Plaintiff, by wire transfer, $[[USD Value 1: Number]] in cash (the “Cash Consideration”), pursuant to the following wiring instructions:

^Surgoinsville Lease Guaranty. 

^Letter of Credit. On the date that is the earlier of the following (the “Cooper Tire L/C Deadline”): (i) seventy-five (75) days from the Settlement Effective Date or (ii) the effective date of Defendants’ Chapter 11 plan (the “Plan”) in the Chapter 11 Cases (the “Plan Effective Date”), Defendants shall have caused Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Bank of America, N.A., or another commercial bank reasonably acceptable to Plaintiff and Defendants, to issue an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit, in customary form for letters of credit for this type (reasonably satisfactory to Plaintiff and Defendants), with automatic renewal and drawing conditions substantially as set forth on the attached Exhibit A (or as such terms are otherwise reasonably satisfactory to Plaintiff and Defendants) in the initial stated amount of $[[USD Value 3: Number]] million (the “Cooper Tire L/C”), which may be drawn upon, one or more times, by Plaintiff only: (a) if the Cooper Tire L/C has not been renewed for at least a 1-year period in accordance with its terms (unless, as a result of any notice of non-renewal received in connection therewith, Defendants cause a replacement letter of credit with identical substantive terms as the then-existing Cooper Tire L/C to be issued by a different commercial bank reasonably acceptable to Plaintiff not less than 30 days prior to the expiry date of the then-existing Cooper Tire L/C); or (b) to reimburse Plaintiff for any amounts that Plaintiff has paid (prior to or concurrently with such draw) on account of, and pursuant to, that certain Guaranty, dated as of [[Date 12: Date]] (the “Surgoinsville Lease Guaranty”), between Plaintiff, as successor to Siebe Inc., and Bank of [[Address 1: Address]] to United States Trust Company; provided, however, that (i) prior to Defendants obtaining the Cooper Tire L/C, if Plaintiff hereafter pays any amounts on account of, and pursuant to, the Surgoinsville Lease Guaranty, Plaintiff shall have an allowed administrative expense priority in the Chapter 11 Cases for the amounts so paid, which shall be paid promptly upon demand, and the Cooper Tire L/C shall be reduced by the amount of such administrative expense claim for which Plaintiff has received payment and (ii) in the case where the Cooper Tire L/C is issued prior to the Plan Effective Date, at the request of Defendants after the occurrence of the Plan Effective Date, Plaintiff agrees to cooperate with Defendants in a commercially reasonable manner in having a replacement letter of credit issued by the letter of credit issuer under the Defendants’ exit working capital facility (which issuer would be Bank of America, N.A., or another commercial bank reasonably acceptable to Plaintiff), it being understood that such replacement letter of credit would contain identical substantive terms as the then-existing Cooper Tire L/C, and that if such replacement letter of credit (or any replacement letter of credit otherwise specified in this clause A(b)(ii)) contains non-identical substantive terms, Defendants shall reimburse Plaintiff for the amount of any reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees incurred by Plaintiff reviewing the replacement letter of credit. On each yearly anniversary of the date of the issuance of the Cooper Tire L/C, the aggregate principal amount of the Cooper Tire L/C shall (by its terms) be automatically reduced by $[[USD Value 4: Number]] million until such time that the Cooper Tire L/C has been reduced to zero (0) dollars and, upon such time, the Cooper Tire L/C, and Defendants’ obligations thereunder, shall cease to exist and be terminated. To the extent that the Cooper Tire L/C is not issued prior to the confirmation of the Plan, the Plan shall obligate Defendants to have issued the Cooper Tire L/C on the Plan Effective Date, and a condition precedent to the occurrence of the Plan Effective Date shall be the issuance of the Cooper Tire L/C in favor of Plaintiff. 

^Release of Guaranty. Prior to the Cooper Tire L/C Deadline, Defendants shall seek to obtain an unconditional release of Plaintiff’s obligations under the Surgoinsville Lease Guaranty. If Defendants are able to obtain the unconditional release of Plaintiff’s obligations under the Surgoinsville Lease Guaranty, Defendant shall have no obligation to obtain or maintain the Cooper Tire L/C, and the issuance of the Cooper Tire L/C shall not be a condition precedent to the occurrence of the Plan Effective Date. 

^Renewal of Lease. If Defendants are unable to obtain the unconditional release of Plaintiff’s obligations under the Surgoinsville Lease Guaranty, Defendants shall not renew the lease (the “Lease”) being guaranteed by the Surgoinsville Lease Guaranty, nor modify or amend the Lease in a manner that increases or extends Plaintiff’s obligations under the Surgoinsville Lease Guaranty, without the prior written approval and consent of Plaintiff. Plaintiff shall not unreasonably withhold such approval and consent. For clarification purposes only, Plaintiff’s withholding of consent would not be unreasonable if, for example, the renewal, modification, or amendment of the Lease would cause the amount of the Cooper Tire L/C to be insufficient to satisfy in full Plaintiff’s obligations under the Surgoinsville Lease Guaranty at any point in time. 

^Dismissal of Pending Proceedings. 

^Cooper Tire Adversary Proceeding. Within three (3) business days after receipt by Plaintiff of: (i) the Cash Consideration; and (ii) the Cooper Tire L/C, if Defendants, prior to the Cooper Tire L/C Deadline, are unable to obtain the unconditional release of Plaintiff’s obligations under the Surgoinsville Lease Guaranty (the “Release Date”), Plaintiff shall file with the Bankruptcy Court a stipulation of dismissal, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, signed by each of the Parties, stating that Plaintiff dismisses all of its claims in the Cooper Tire Adversary Proceeding with prejudice, with the Parties to bear their own costs. 

^Canadian Litigation. On the Release Date, Plaintiff and CSA Canada shall file with the Canadian Court and the Court of Appeal for Ontario (the “Court of Appeal”) any and all notices or motions required or advisable so as to give effect to this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) a notice or motion filed with the Canadian Court for the Canadian Court to withdraw or vacate the Canadian Tax Order and (ii) a notice or motion filed with the Court of Appeal for CSA Canada to withdraw its appeal of the Canadian Tax Order, with Plaintiff and CSA Canada to bear their own costs. 

^Withdrawal of Proof of Claims. On the Release Date, the proofs of claim filed by Plaintiff in the Chapter 11 Cases shall be deemed withdrawn without the necessity for a further court order and Plaintiff understands and agrees that it shall file no further proofs of claim in the Chapter 11 Cases. 

^Mutual Releases. 

^Release by Plaintiff. Subject to subparagraph 4.C., upon the payment of the Cash Consideration and the issuance of the Cooper Tire L/C, Plaintiff, Cooper Tyre UK, and all of their agents, representatives, officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, trustees, advisors, accountants, attorneys, successors and assigns hereby release, acquit, and forever discharge Defendants and all of their agents, representatives, officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, trustees, advisors, accountants, attorneys, successors and assigns from any and all claims, counterclaims, demands, damages, causes of action, suits, rights to legal remedies, rights to equitable remedies, rights to payment, liabilities, costs and interests of any kind relating to arising under or in connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Tax Refunds, or any other arrangements or agreements between Plaintiff, Cooper Tyre UK and/or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates on one hand and the Defendants and/or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates on the other, including attorneys’ fees and costs, whether known or unknown, in law, equity or otherwise, from the beginning of time through the Release Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Plaintiff, Cooper Tyre UK and/or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates understand and agree that, as of the Release Date, they have no right, claim, or interest in the Tax Refunds or any other tax refunds that may be paid to Defendants or their subsidiaries or affiliates. 

^Release by Defendants. Subject to subparagraph 4.C., upon the completion by Cooper Tire of its obligations set forth in paragraph 3 of this Agreement, Defendants and all of their agents, representatives, officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, trustees, advisors, accountants, attorneys, successors and assigns hereby release, acquit, and forever discharge Plaintiff, Cooper Tyre UK, and all of their agents, representatives, officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, trustees, advisors, accountants, attorneys, successors and assigns from any and all claims, counterclaims, demands, damages, causes of action, suits, rights to legal remedies, rights to equitable remedies, rights to payment, liabilities, costs and interests of any kind relating to arising under or in connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Tax Refunds or any other arrangements or agreements between Defendants and/or their subsidiaries or affiliates on one hand and Plaintiff, Cooper Tyre UK, and/or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates on the other, including attorneys’ fees and costs, whether known or unknown, in law, equity or otherwise, from the beginning of time through the Release Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Defendants understand and agree that, as of the Release Date, Plaintiff has no duty or obligation to indemnify Holdings or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates for any taxes imposed on or payable with respect to the Sold Companies and their direct and indirect majority or wholly-owned subsidiaries. Further, Plaintiff and Cooper Tyre UK and their affiliates have no obligation to make any payments related to the “Siebe Plan” as set out in Paragraph 5.7 of the Stock Purchase Agreement, and Defendants have no right to be reimbursed for any payments made or to be made with respect to the “Siebe Plan.” 

^Ongoing Obligations Not in Dispute. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that they shall continue to honor and be bound by the following obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement whether or not any such obligations remain unfulfilled in whole or in part as of the date hereof: 

^^^Defendants shall fully honor their obligations with respect to “Pre-Closing Self Insured Workers’ Compensation Arrangements” in accordance with section 5.7 of the Stock Purchase Agreement; and 

^^^Plaintiff shall fully honor its indemnification obligations with respect to sections 8.1(a)(vi) and (vii) of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Defendants represent that, as of the date they execute this Agreement, neither Defendants nor their subsidiaries or affiliates have knowledge of any facts that would give rise to an indemnification obligation under sections 8.1(a)(vi) or (vii) of the Stock Purchase Agreement, except for (a) those items of which Plaintiff has been previously notified in writing or is aware; (b) those items listed in Schedule 3.15 or Schedule 8.1(a)(vi)(D) of the Stock Purchase Agreement; or (c) those items listed in Schedule 15 of the “Siebe Purchase Agreement” as defined in Section 8.1 of the Stock Purchase Agreement. 

Upon completion of the obligations set out in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of this Agreement, the Parties will have no obligations to one another under the Stock Purchase Agreement other than obligations specified here in subparagraphs 4.C(i) and (ii). 

^Preservation of Defendants’ Obligations under this Agreement. The confirmation of any plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation, including without limitation, the Debtors’ Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization, shall not impair, abridge or otherwise affect any of the Defendants’ obligations arising under this Agreement. Further, the Defendants shall include language in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Plaintiff and the Creditors’ Committee in any order submitted to approve any plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation to preserve the Defendants’ obligations arising under this Agreement. 

^Motion for Approval of this Agreement. Within seven (7) days of execution of this Agreement by the Parties, Defendants shall file with the Bankruptcy Court a joint motion (the “Motion for Approval”) seeking approval of this Agreement. The Motion for Approval shall be noticed for consideration by the Bankruptcy Court at the first omnibus hearing scheduled in the Chapter 11 Cases no later than twenty-five (25) days after execution of this Agreement by all of the Parties.

This Agreement will become effective on the Settlement Effective Date.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an admission of the validity of any claim being settled hereby or of any liability with respect to any such claim. In the event that this Agreement is not approved by the Bankruptcy Court, this Agreement shall be of no force or effect, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be an admission or concession of, or be in any way binding upon, any of the Parties, and this Agreement shall be inadmissible in any proceeding as a settlement document governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and/or its analogous state rules. 

^Stay of Proceedings. 

^Cooper Tire Adversary Proceeding.
