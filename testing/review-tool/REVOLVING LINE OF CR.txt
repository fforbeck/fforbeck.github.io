FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned BALLANTYNE STRONG, INC. (“Borrower”) promises to pay to the order of WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“Bank”) at its office at 13625 California Street, Suite 200, [[Address 2: Address]], or at such other place as the holder hereof may designate, in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds, the principal sum of Twenty Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 1]]), or so much thereof as may be advanced and be outstanding, with interest thereon, to be computed on each advance from the date of its disbursement as set forth herein.

DEFINITIONS:

As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth after each, and any other term defined in this Note shall have the meaning set forth at the place defined:

^^“Business Day” means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which commercial banks in Nebraska are authorized or required by law to close.

^^“Daily One Month LIBOR” means, for any day, the rate of interest equal to LIBOR then in effect for delivery for a one (1) month period.

^^“LIBOR” means the rate per annum (rounded upward, if necessary, to the nearest whole 1/8 of [[Percentage 1: Number]]%) and determined pursuant to the following formula:

LIBOR =      \centered Base LIBOR
\centered [[Percentage 2: Number]]% - LIBOR Reserve Percentage

^^^“Base LIBOR” means the rate per annum for United States dollar deposits quoted by Bank as the Inter-Bank Market Offered Rate, with the understanding that such rate is quoted by Bank for the purpose of calculating effective rates of interest for loans making reference thereto, for delivery of funds for one (1) month in an amount equal to the outstanding principal balance of this Note. Borrower understands and agrees that Bank may base its quotation of the Inter-Bank Market Offered Rate upon such offers or other market indicators of the Inter-Bank Market as Bank in its discretion deems appropriate including, but not limited to, the rate offered for U.S. dollar deposits on the London Inter-Bank Market.

^^^“LIBOR Reserve Percentage” means the reserve percentage prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for “Eurocurrency Liabilities” (as defined in Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board, as amended), adjusted by Bank for expected changes in such reserve percentage during the term of this Note.

INTEREST:

^^Interest. The outstanding principal balance of this Note shall bear interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed) at a fluctuating rate per annum determined by Bank to be one and one quarter percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) above Daily One Month LIBOR in effect from time to time. Each change in the rate of interest hereunder shall become effective on each Business Day a change in 

Daily One Month LIBOR is announced within Bank. Bank is hereby authorized to note the date and interest rate applicable to this Note and any payments made thereon on Bank’s books and records (either manually or by electronic entry) and/or on any schedule attached to this Note, which notations shall be prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information noted.

^^Taxes and Regulatory Costs. Borrower shall pay to Bank immediately upon demand, in addition to any other amounts due or to become due hereunder, any and all (i) withholdings, interest equalization taxes, stamp taxes or other taxes (except income and franchise taxes) imposed by any domestic or foreign governmental authority and related in any manner to LIBOR, and (ii) future, supplemental, emergency or other changes in the LIBOR Reserve Percentage, assessment rates imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or similar requirements or costs imposed by any domestic or foreign governmental authority or resulting from compliance by Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other governmental authority and related in any manner to LIBOR to the extent they are not included in the calculation of LIBOR. In determining which of the foregoing are attributable to any LIBOR option available to Borrower hereunder, any reasonable allocation made by Bank among its operations shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower.

^^Payment of Interest. Interest accrued on this Note shall be payable on the first day of each month, commencing [[Date 2: Date]].

^^Default Interest. From and after the maturity date of this Note, or such earlier date as all principal owing hereunder becomes due and payable by acceleration or otherwise, or at Bank’s option upon the occurrence, and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the outstanding principal balance of this Note shall bear interest at an increased rate per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed) equal to four percent ([[Percentage 4: Number]]%) above the rate of interest from time to time applicable to this Note.

Borrower may from time to time during the term of this Note borrow, partially or wholly repay its outstanding borrowings, and reborrow, subject to all of the limitations, terms and conditions of this Note and of any document executed in connection with or governing this Note; provided however, that the total outstanding borrowings under this Note shall not at any time exceed the principal amount stated above.

the fact that persons other than those authorized to request advances may have authority to draw against such account. The holder shall have no obligation to determine whether any person requesting an advance is or has been authorized by Borrower.

^^Application of Payments. Each payment made on this Note shall be credited first, to any interest then due and second, to the outstanding principal balance hereof.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT:

Any default in the payment or performance of any obligation under this Note, or any defined event of default under the Credit Agreement, shall constitute an “Event of Default” under this Note.
