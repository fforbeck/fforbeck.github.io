Re: Exenatide Manufacturing Agreement between Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Amylin”) and Mallinckrodt Inc. (“Mallinckrodt”) effective [[Date 2: Date]], as amended (the “Agreement”)

Dear Tom:

As a consequence of the immediately preceding sentence, and notwithstanding Section 2.3 of the Agreement, Amylin will be required to purchase [***] ([***]) kilograms of Product during the eighth Contract Year (calendar year 2011), it being the understanding of Amylin and Mallinckrodt that the intent of the amendments to the Agreement contemplated by this paragraph is only to alter the timing of Amylin’s purchases and not the total volume of Product that Amylin is required to purchase during the sixth, seventh and eighth Contract Years (calendar years 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively).

In addition, Amylin and Mallinckrodt agree that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Agreement, including, without limitation Section 2.4, the price per gram for Product purchased in the sixth Contract Year (calendar year 2009) and seventh Contract Year (calendar year 2010) will be $ [***].

Except as expressly set forth above, the terms and conditions of the Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. The terms and conditions of this amendment letter will be incorporated into and made a part of the Agreement effective as of [[Date 3: Date]]. Defined terms used herein, if not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.
