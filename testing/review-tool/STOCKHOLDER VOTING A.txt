NOW, THEREFORE, in and as consideration of and for the foregoing premises and the representations, warranties, agreements, and covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

^**Voting**. During the term of this Agreement, the Stockholders agree to vote, or cause to be voted (at all meetings of stockholders of the Company and pursuant to all written consents in lieu of voting at a meeting), all shares of the Company’s voting securities now or hereafter owned by them, whether beneficially or otherwise, or as to which they have voting power (the “**Shares**”) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

^**Board of Directors**.  
^^**Voting**. The Board of Directors of the Company shall initially consist of three (3) directors comprised of the individuals set forth on Schedule 1.6(b) of the Merger Agreement. During the term of this Agreement, each of the Stockholders agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, all Shares beneficially owned by such Person, in such a manner as may be necessary (whether at an annual, special, adjourned or postponed meeting of shareholders, by written consent or otherwise) to elect the individuals set forth on Schedule 1.6(b) of the Merger Agreement (each, a “**Director**”) as members of the Board of Directors.

^^**Vacancies**. In the event that any Director is removed for cause, resigns or is otherwise unable or unwilling to serve as a director of the Company prior to the expiration of the term of such Director, the holders of the Shares will take such action necessary to cause the election or appointment of a replacement director designated by the remaining Directors to fill the vacancy and serve as a director of the Company for the unexpired term of such Director.

^**Proxy**. In order to implement the voting agreement set forth in Section 1 and Section 2, and limited thereto, each Stockholder hereby grants to the Agent, with the Agent having full power of substitution, a proxy (a “**Proxy**”) to vote, on all matters relating solely to the election of directors and the filling of vacancies on the Board of Directors as contemplated by Section 2 above and consistent with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, on which the Shares are entitled to vote, any and all Shares which such Stockholder is entitled to vote, and to give written consents in lieu of voting such Shares, in the same manner that the Agent votes, or provides written consent in lieu of a vote as to, Shares owned by the Agent.

^**Irrevocable Proxy**. EACH STOCKHOLDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ITS PROXY IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST, AND AGREES THAT ITS PROXY IS IRREVOCABLE. THE PROXY WILL AUTOMATICALLY EXPIRE UPON TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 8 BELOW. SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING, THIS PROXY WILL SURVIVE THE DEATH, DISABILITY, OR INCAPACITY OF THE STOCKHOLDERS.

^**Exercise of Rights**. Each Stockholder agrees and acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement limits the ability of the Agent to exercise any of the Agent’s rights under this Agreement or as a stockholder of the Company in accordance with the Agent’s own interests without regard to the interests of such Stockholder. The Agent has the right to vote or exercise (or refrain from voting or exercising) this proxy at any time and from time to time as it may elect in its sole discretion.

^**Reasonable Efforts to Cooperate**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, and/or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
