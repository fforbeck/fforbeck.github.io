Assured Guaranty Corp., a Maryland-domiciled insurance company (“Assured Guaranty”), in consideration of the payment of the premium and on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Policy (which includes each endorsement hereto), hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of the Insured Obligations, that portion of the Insured Amounts which shall become Due for Payment during the Term of the Policy but shall be unpaid by reason of Nonpayment. Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the endorsement attached hereto. 

Assured Guaranty will make payment of any amount required to be paid under this Policy following receipt of notice as described in the endorsement attached hereto. Such payments of principal and interest shall be made only upon presentation of an instrument of assignment in form and substance satisfactory to Assured Guaranty, transferring to Assured Guaranty all rights under such Insured Obligations to receive the principal of and interest on the Insured Obligations, to the extent of such payments of principal and interest. Payment by Assured Guaranty to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders shall discharge the obligations of Assured Guaranty under this Policy to the extent of such payment. 

In the event that the Trustee for the Insured Obligations has notice that any payment of principal of or interest in an Insured Obligation which has become Due for Payment and which has been made to a Holder by or on behalf of the Trustee has been deemed a preferential transfer and has been recovered from such Holder pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code in accordance with a final, nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction, such Holder will be entitled to payment from Assured Guaranty to the extent of such recovery if sufficient funds are not otherwise available (in accordance with the endorsement attached hereto). 

This Policy is non-cancelable for any reason. The premium on this Policy is not refundable for any reason. This Policy does not insure against loss of any prepayment premium or other acceleration payment which at any time may become due in respect of any Insured Obligation, other than at the sole option of Assured Guaranty, nor against any risk other than Nonpayment, including the failure of the Trustee to remit amounts received to the Holders of Insured Obligations and any shortfalls attributable to withholding or other taxes, including interest and penalties in respect of such liability. 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Assured Guaranty hereby waives, in each case for the benefit of the Holders only, all rights and defenses of any kind (including, without limitation, the defense of fraud in the inducement or in fact or any other circumstance that would have the effect of discharging a surety, guarantor or any other Person in law or in equity) that may be available to Assured Guaranty to deny or avoid payment of its obligations under this Policy in accordance with the express provisions hereof. Nothing in this paragraph will be construed (i) to waive, limit or otherwise impair, and Assured Guaranty expressly reserves, Assured Guaranty’s rights and remedies, including, without limitation: its right to assert any claim or to pursue recoveries (based on contractual rights, securities law violations, fraud or other causes of action) against any Person or entity, in each case, whether directly or acquired as a subrogee, assignee or otherwise, subsequent to making any payment to the Beneficiary in accordance with the express provisions hereof, and/or (ii) to require payment by Assured Guaranty of any amounts that have been previously paid or that are not otherwise due in accordance with the express provisions of this Policy. Assured Guaranty does not waive its rights to seek payment of all amounts to which it is entitled pursuant to the Operative Documents. 

This Policy (which includes each endorsement hereto) sets forth in full the undertaking of Assured Guaranty with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified, altered or affected by any other agreement or instrument, including, without limitation, any modification thereto or amendment thereof. 

This Policy shall be governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of [[Address 1: Address]]

^^^The amount determined under paragraph 3 of Endorsement No. 1 to the Policy is $ .

^^^The Trust Collateral Agent is making a claim under the Policy for the Shortfall to be applied to the payment of Scheduled Payments. 

\centered A-1 

^^^The Trust Collateral Agent agrees that, following receipt of funds from Assured Guaranty, it shall (a) hold such amounts in trust and apply the same directly to the payment of Scheduled Payments on the Insured Obligations when due; (b) not apply such funds for any other purpose; (c) not commingle such funds with other funds held by the Trust Collateral Agent and (d) maintain an accurate record of such payments with respect to each Insured Obligation and the corresponding claim on the Policy and proceeds thereof, and, if any Insured Obligation is required to be surrendered or presented for such payment, shall stamp on each such Insured Obligation the legend “$[insert applicable amount] paid by Assured Guaranty and the balance hereof has been cancelled and reissued” and then shall deliver such Insured Obligation to Assured Guaranty. 

^^^The Trust Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Holders and the Indenture Trustee, hereby assigns to Assured Guaranty (a) all rights of the Holders and the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Insured Obligations to the extent of any payments under the Policy and (b) any claims in respect of amounts due to the Holders or the Indenture Trustee in respect of securities law violations, fraud or other claims arising out of or relating to the offer and sale of the Insured Obligations. The foregoing assignments are in addition to, and not in limitation of, rights of subrogation otherwise available to Assured Guaranty in respect of such payments. Payments to Assured Guaranty in respect of the foregoing assignments shall in all cases be subject to and subordinate to the rights of the Holders to receive all Scheduled Payments in respect of the Insured Obligations. The Trust Collateral Agent shall take such action and deliver such instruments as may be reasonably requested or required by Assured Guaranty to effectuate the purpose or provisions of this clause (ix). 

^^^The Trust Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Holders and the Indenture Trustee, hereby appoints Assured Guaranty as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust Collateral Agent, the Indenture Trustee and each such Holder in any legal proceeding with respect to the Insured Obligations. The Trust Collateral Agent hereby agrees that, so long as an Insurer Default (as defined in the Indenture) shall not exist, Assured Guaranty may at any time during the continuation of any proceeding by or against the Obligor under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, rehabilitation or similar law (an “Insolvency Proceeding”) direct all matters relating to such Insolvency Proceeding, including without limitation, (A) all matters relating to any claim in connection with an Insolvency Proceeding seeking the avoidance as a preferential transfer of any payment made with respect to the Insured Obligations (a “Preference Claim”), (B) the direction of any appeal of any order relating to any Preference Claim at the expense of Assured Guaranty but subject to reimbursement as provided in the Insurance Agreement and (C) the posting of any surety, supersedeas or performance bond pending any such appeal. In addition, the Trust Collateral Agent hereby agrees that Assured Guaranty shall be subrogated to, and the Trust Collateral Agent on its behalf and on behalf of each Holder, hereby delegates and assigns, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the rights of the Trust Collateral Agent and each Holder in the conduct of any Insolvency Proceeding, including, without limitation, all rights of any party to an adversary proceeding or action with respect to any court order issued in connection with any such Insolvency Proceeding. 

^^^Payment should be made by wire transfer directed to [ACCOUNT TO BE SPECIFIED].
