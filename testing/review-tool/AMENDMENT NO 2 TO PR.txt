WHEREAS, Borrower and Lender desire to amend the terms and conditions of the Note, in order that, among other things, the maturity date will be extended by one month.

\centered **AMENDMENT** 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 

^Maturity Date Extension and Interest. The maturity date of the Note shall be amended from [[Date 1]] to [[Date 4: Date]]. All accrued interest to [[Date 1]] shall be paid on [[Date 5: Date]]. 

^Warrants. As consideration for extending the maturity date of the Note, Lender shall exchange (a) its Class A warrants to purchase up to [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of Borrower common stock, $[[USD Value 4: Number]] par value per share, at an exercise price of $[[USD Value 5: Number]] per share and (b) its Class D warrants to purchase up to [[Shares 2: Number]] shares of Borrower common stock at an exercise price of $[[USD Value 6: Number]] per share, for (c) two (2) Class G Warrants to purchase up to 697,639 and [[Shares 2]] shares of Borrower common stock, respectively, each with an exercise price of $[[USD Value 7: Number]] per share. In addition, we will issue 1,040,000 Class G Warrants with an exercise price of $[[USD Value 7]] if the note and accrued interest is not repaid in full by [[Date 4]], in which case, the maturity date will become [[Date 6: Date]] and the interest rate compounded annually will become [[Percentage 1: Number]]%. The terms of the Class G Warrants shall be substantially similar to prior class G warrants issued by Borrower. 

^Legend. All Warrants issued pursuant hereto, and any certificates evidencing Shares issued upon the exercise of such Warrants, shall bear a legend that reads: 

THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR 

^^^^^ 
THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT. 

^Existing Terms. Except as provided herein, the Note shall remain in full force and effect. 

^Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same Amendment. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amendment No. 2 to Promissory Note to be effective as of the date first above written.
