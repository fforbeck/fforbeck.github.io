Attn: Ms. Maria Kraus and Mr. Ted Kaminer 

Re: $[[USD Value 1: Number]] Committed Line of Credit  
Dear Ms. Kraus and Mr. Kaminer:  

We are pleased to inform you that PNC Bank, National Association (the **“Bank”**), has approved your request for a committed line of credit to BIOCLINICA, INC. and OXFORD BIO-IMAGING RESEARCH, INC. (jointly and severally, individually and collectively, the **“Borrower”**). We look forward to this opportunity to help you meet the financing needs of your business. All the details regarding your line of credit are outlined in the following sections of this letter. 

^Facility and Use of Proceeds. This is a committed revolving line of credit under which the Borrower may request and the Bank, subject to the terms and conditions of this letter, will make advances to the Borrower from time to time until the Expiration Date, in an amount in the aggregate at any time outstanding not to exceed $[[USD Value 2: Number]] (the **“Line of Credit”** or the **“Loan”**). The **“Expiration Date”** means [[Date 2: Date]], or such later date as may be designated by the Bank by written notice to the Borrower. Advances under the Line of Credit will be used for working capital or other general business purposes of the Borrower, and, subject to the provisions of this Letter Agreement, for letters of credit and for acquisitions. Voluntary reductions of the commitment under the Line of Credit by the Borrower must be in minimum amounts of $[[USD Value 3: Number]]. 

The Borrower may request that the Bank, in lieu of cash advances, issue standby letters of credit (individually, a **“Letter of Credit”** and collectively the **“Letters of Credit”**) under the Line of Credit having expiration dates not later than eighteen (18) months after the Expiration Date, in the face amount in the aggregate at any time outstanding not to exceed $[[USD Value 4: Number]]; provided, however, that after giving effect to the face amount of such Letter of Credit, the sum of the aggregate outstanding advances under the Loan and the aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit issued and outstanding shall not exceed the Loan. The availability of advances under the Line of Credit shall be reduced by the face amount of each Letter of Credit issued and outstanding (whether or not drawn). Each payment by the Bank under a Letter of Credit shall in the Bank’s discretion constitute an advance of principal under the Line of Credit and shall be evidenced by the Note (as defined below). The Letters of Credit shall be governed by the terms of this letter and by one or more reimbursement agreements, in form and content satisfactory to the Bank, executed by the Borrower in favor of the Bank (collectively, the **“Reimbursement Agreement”**). Each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit must be accompanied by the Borrower’s execution of an application on the Bank’s standard forms (each, an **“Application”**), together with all supporting documentation. Each Letter of Credit will be issued in the Bank’s sole discretion and in a form reasonably acceptable to the Bank. Borrower shall pay: (i) a Letter of Credit Fee in the annual amount set forth on Annex 1 attached hereto, payable quarterly, in arrears, on the 

^^^^^

Page 2 

daily average aggregate face amount of the Letters of Credit; and (ii) the Bank’s other fees, commissions and expenses incurred in connection with the issuance and administration of each Letter of Credit as are customarily charged from time to time by the Bank. This letter is not a pre-advice for the issuance of a letter of credit and is not irrevocable. 

^Note. The obligation of the Borrower to repay advances under the Line of Credit shall be evidenced by a promissory note (the **“Note”**) in form and content satisfactory to the Bank. 

This letter (the **“Letter Agreement”**), the Note and the other agreements and documents executed and/or delivered pursuant hereto, as each may be amended, modified, extended or renewed from time to time, will constitute the **“Loan Documents.”** Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Loan Documents. 

^Interest Rate. Interest on the unpaid balance of the Line of Credit advances will be charged at the rates, and be payable on the dates and times, set forth in the Note. 

^Repayment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Letter Agreement, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow under the Line of Credit until the Expiration Date, on which date the outstanding principal balance and any accrued but unpaid interest shall be due and payable. Interest will be due and payable as set forth in the Note, and will be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid on the actual number of days that principal is outstanding. 

^Security. The Borrower must cause or has previously caused the following to be executed and delivered to the Bank in form and content satisfactory to the Bank as security for the Loan: 

^^guaranty and suretyship agreements, under which RED OAK RESEARCH, INC. and BIOCLINICA ACQUISITION, INC. (individually or collectively, the **“Guarantor”**) will unconditionally jointly and severally guarantee the due and punctual payment of all indebtedness owed to the Bank by the Borrower. 

The Loan will be cross-defaulted with all other present and future Obligations (as defined in the Loan Documents) of the Borrower to the Bank. 

^Covenants. Unless compliance is waived in writing by the Bank, until payment in full of the Loan and termination of the commitment for the Line of Credit: 

^^The Borrower will promptly submit to the Bank such information as the Bank may reasonably request relating to the Borrower’s affairs 

^^Neither the Borrower nor the Guarantor will make or permit: (i) any material change in its form of organization or the nature of its business as carried on as of the date of this Letter Agreement; or (ii) any change in stock ownership such that one person or entity, together with their affiliates, owns thirty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) or more of the equity interests in BioClinica, Inc. 

^^The Borrower will notify the Bank in writing of the occurrence of any Event of Default or an act or condition which, with the passage of time, the giving of notice or both might become an Event of Default. 

^^The Borrower will comply with the financial and other covenants included in Exhibit “A” hereto.

^^The Borrower has full power and authority to enter into the transactions provided for in this Letter Agreement and has been duly authorized to do so by all necessary and appropriate action and when executed and delivered by the Borrower, this Letter Agreement and the other Loan Documents will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement may be limited by equitable principles or by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting creditors’ rights generally. 

^^There does not exist any default or violation by the Borrower of or under any of the material terms, conditions or obligations of: (i) its organizational documents; (ii) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, franchise, permit, contract, agreement, or other instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound; or (iii) any law, regulation, ruling, order, injunction, decree, condition or other requirement applicable to or imposed upon the Borrower by any law or by any governmental authority, court or agency.
