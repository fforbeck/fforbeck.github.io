**WHEREAS**, the Compensation Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors decided that the Participant should be granted stock options to purchase shares of the Corporation’s common stock, $[[USD Value 3: Number]] par value per share (“Common Stock”), on the terms and conditions set forth below, and in accordance with the terms of the Plan. 

**NOW, THEREFORE**, in consideration of the covenants and agreements herein contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

^**Grant of Options**.  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Corporation hereby grants to the Participant the right and option to purchase up to a total of ___ shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation, at the option price of $  per share (the “Options”).

MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES    MAXIMUM NUMBER OF THAT MAY BE PURCHASED BY    SHARES THAT MAY BE EXERCISING NONSTATUTORY    PURCHASED BY PERIOD    OPTIONS    EXERCISING ISOs From , 20 to , 20    Up to  shares (less any shares previously purchased by exercising Nonstatutory Options)    Up to  shares (less any shares previously purchased by exercising ISOs)  

If, during any of these periods, the Participant fails to exercise the Options with respect to all or any portion of the shares that may be acquired at such time, the Participant shall be entitled to exercise the Options with respect to the remaining portion of such shares at any subsequent time prior to the termination date of the Options. 

The Options intended to be ISOs are subject to the $[[USD Value 1: Number]] annual limit on vesting of ISOs as set forth in Section 422(d) of the Code. To the extent the aggregate fair market value (determined at the date of grant) of the shares of Common Stock with respect to which those ISOs first become exercisable by the Participant during any calendar year under this Section 2 (when aggregated with any prior ISOs granted to the Participant under stock option plans of the Corporation) exceeds $[[USD Value 2: Number]] whether by reason of accelerated vesting under Sections 8, 9 or 10 or otherwise, the Options shall consist of ISOs for the maximum number of shares that may be covered by ISOs without violating Section 422(d) of the Code, and the remaining Options becoming exercisable in that year shall be treated as Nonstatutory Options. 

^**Termination Date of Options**.  

The Options granted herein shall terminate on , 20, the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, and the Participant shall have no right to exercise the Options at any time thereafter. 

^**Manner of Exercise**.  

If the Participant elects to exercise the Options to purchase shares of Common Stock, the Participant shall give written notice of such exercise to the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation. The notice of exercise shall state the number of shares of Common Stock as to which the Options are being exercised, and the Corporation shall determine whether the Options exercised are ISOs or Nonstatutory Options. 

The Participant may exercise the Options to purchase all, or any lesser whole number, of the number of shares of Common Stock that the Participant is then permitted to purchase under Section 2. 

^**Payment for Shares**.  

Full payment of the option price for the shares of Common Stock purchased by exercising the Options shall be due at the time the notice of exercise is delivered pursuant to Section 4. Such payment may be made (i) in cash, (ii) by delivery of shares of Common Stock currently owned by the Participant with a fair market value equal to the option price, or (iii) in any other form acceptable to the Corporation. 

Alternatively, the Participant shall be deemed to have paid the full option price due upon exercise of the Options, if the Participant’s notice of exercise is accompanied by an irrevocable instruction to the Corporation to deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Options (less any shares withheld to satisfy the Participant’s tax obligations pursuant to Section 7 below) promptly to a broker-dealer designated by Participant, together with an irrevocable instruction to such broker-dealer to sell at least that portion of the shares necessary to pay the option price (and any tax withholding related expenses specified by the parties), and that portion of the sale proceeds needed to pay the option price is delivered directly to the Corporation no later than the close of business on the settlement date. 

^**Issuance of Stock Certificates for Shares**. 

The stock certificates (or other evidence of ownership) for any shares of Common Stock issuable to the Participant upon exercise of the Options shall be delivered to the Participant (or to the person to whom the rights of the Participant shall have passed by will or the laws of descent and distribution) as promptly after the date of exercise as is feasible, but not before the Participant has paid the option price for such shares and made any arrangements for tax withholding, as required by Section 7. 

^**Tax Withholding**.  

Whenever the Participant exercises Options, the Corporation shall notify the Participant of the amount of tax (if any) that must be withheld by the Corporation under all applicable federal, state and local tax laws. With respect to each exercise of the Options, the Participant agrees to make arrangements with the Corporation to (a) remit the required amount to the Corporation in cash, (b) authorize the Corporation to withhold a portion of the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon the exercise with a value 

^^^^^ 
equal to the required amount, (c) deliver to the Corporation shares of Common Stock with a value equal to the required amount, (d) authorize the deduction of the required amount from the Participant’s compensation, or (e) otherwise provide for payment of the required amount in any other manner satisfactory to the Corporation. 

^**Termination of Employment; Change in Corporate Control**. 

In the event of a Change in Corporate Control (as described below), or if the Participant’s employment with the Corporation is terminated before the Options expire or have been exercised with respect to all of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Options (as provided in subsections (a) and (b) below), the Participant shall have the right to exercise the Options during a period of ninety (90) days following the date of the Change in Corporate Control or termination of employment (as applicable), but in no event later than , 20, and the Options shall expire at the end of such period. 

^^In the event of a Change in Corporate Control, or if the Participant’s employment is terminated involuntarily without “Cause” (as defined in the Participant’s Employment Agreement), any portion of the Options not previously exercisable under Section 2 shall become immediately exercisable. 

^^In the case of an involuntary termination not described in subsection (a) above, or a voluntary termination by the Participant not following a Change in Corporate Control, the maximum number of shares the Participant may purchase by exercising the Options shall be the number of shares which could be purchased at the date of termination pursuant to Section 2. 

For purposes of this Section 8, termination of employment as a result of the expiration of the Participant’s Employment Agreement shall be considered a voluntary termination if the notice of non-renewal was delivered by the Participant and an involuntary termination if the notice of non-renewal was delivered by the Corporation and in both instances, the Participant is no longer employed by the Corporation. 

For purposes of this Section 8, a “Change in Corporate Control” shall have the meaning set forth in the Participant’s Employment Agreement. To the extent that there is a conflict between the definition set forth in the Participant’s Employment Agreement and the definition set forth in the Plan, the definition of “Change in Corporate Control” set forth in the Participant’s Employment Agreement shall control. 

^**Effect of Death**.  

If the Participant dies before the Options expire or have been exercised with respect to all of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Options, any portion of the Options not previously exercisable under Section 2 shall become exercisable, and the Participant’s executor, administrator, or any person to whom the Options may be transferred by the Participant’s will or by the laws of descent and distribution, shall have the right to exercise the Options, to the extent not previously exercised, at any time prior to the first anniversary of the date of death, but in no event later than , 20. For this purpose, the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to such person as if he or she was the Participant. 

^**Effect of Permanent and Total Disability or Retirement After Age 65**. 

If the termination of the Participant’s employment occurs after a finding of the Participant’s permanent and total disability, or as a result of retirement after age 65, any portion of the Options not previously exercisable under Section 2 shall become exercisable, and the Options may be exercised at any time during the period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination of employment, or retirement, as the case may be, but in no event later than , 20. 

^**Nontransferability**.  

The Participant’s rights under this Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by the Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The Options may not be exercised by anyone other than the Participant or, in the case of the Participant’s death, by the person to whom the rights of the Participant shall have passed by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 

^**Securities Laws**.  

The Corporation may from time to time impose any conditions on the exercise of the Options as it deems necessary or advisable to ensure that the Options granted hereunder, and each exercise thereof, satisfy the applicable requirements of federal and state securities laws. Such conditions to satisfy applicable federal and state securities laws may include, without limitation, the partial or complete suspension of the right to exercise the Options until the offering of the shares covered by the Options have been registered 

^^^^^ 
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the printing of legends on all stock certificates issued to the Participant describing the restrictions on transfer of such shares. 

^**Rights Prior to Issuance of Certificates**. 

Neither the Participant nor any person to whom the rights of the Participant shall have passed by will or the laws of descent and distribution shall have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock until the date of the issuance to him or her of certificates (or other evidence of ownership) for such Common Stock as provided in Section 6 above. 

^**Options Not to Affect Employment**.  

Neither this Agreement nor the Options granted hereunder shall confer upon the Participant any right to continued employment with the Corporation. This Agreement shall not in any way modify or restrict any rights the Corporation may have to terminate such employment under the terms of the Participant’s Employment Agreement. 

^**Miscellaneous**.  

^^This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts all of which taken together will constitute one and the same instrument. 

^^The terms of this Agreement may only be amended, modified or waived by a written agreement executed by both of the parties hereto. 

^^The validity, performance, construction and effect of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law; provided, however, that matters of corporate law, including the issuance of shares of the Common Stock, shall be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

**IN WITNESS WHEREOF**, the parties have executed this Agreement on the date and year first above written.
