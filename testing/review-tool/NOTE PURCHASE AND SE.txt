^\centered SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

^^**Survival**. The representations and warranties of the Borrower, the Subsidiaries and the Purchasers contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Loan Documents.

^^**Indemnification**. The Borrower and each Subsidiary, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold each Purchaser, its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, attorneys, successors and assigns (each a “**Purchaser Indemnified Party**”) harmless from and against all Losses incurred, suffered or arising out of, or by reason of, any matter relating, directly or indirectly, to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, unless such Losses are the result of the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of such Purchaser Indemnified Party. Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify, defend and hold the Borrower and each Subsidiary, their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys, successors and assigns (each a “**Borrower Indemnified Party**”) harmless against all Losses as a result of the breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by such Purchaser in this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, unless such Losses are a result of the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of such Borrower Indemnified Party.

^^**Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings***.*** Promptly after receipt by any Indemnified Party of notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement of any action, proceeding or investigation in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8.2, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Borrower or the applicable Purchaser, as applicable (each an “Indemnifying Party**”) in writing and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and shall assume the payment of all fees and expenses; provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure to notify. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless: (a) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel; or (b) in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such Indemnified Party representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Indemnifying Party shall not effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such proceeding.

The security interest granted hereunder will terminate upon repayment in full of all Note Indebtedness.

^^^Each Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that such security interest granted hereunder may be enforced only by the action of the holders of a majority of the Note Indebtedness and that no such holder shall have any right individually to seek to enforce any such security interest or to realize upon the security granted hereby, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the holders of a majority of the Note Indebtedness for the benefit of all such holders upon the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

^^**Severability**.

^^**Delays or Omissions**. No delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing to any party under this Agreement, upon any breach or default of any other party under this Agreement, shall impair any such right, power or remedy of such nonbreaching or nondefaulting party nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring.

^^**Governing Law**.

Upon execution of this Agreement, each of the Purchasers shall have been deemed to appoint Terry Phillips, as their agent and attorney-in-fact (the “Representative”), with full power and authority (including power of substitution), except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, in the name of and for and on behalf the Purchasers, or in such person’s own name as the Representative of each of the Purchasers, to execute any subordination and intercreditor agreements with SunTrust or any other Senior Lender; provided any such agreement applies to all Purchasers to the same effect without any distinction. The authority conferred under this Section 9.16 shall be an agency coupled with an interest, and all authority conferred hereby is irrevocable and not subject to termination by the Purchasers or any of them, or by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of any Purchasers, the termination of any trust or estate or the occurrence of any other event. If Terry Phillips resigns, dies or is otherwise unable to serve as the Representative, the successor Representative shall be designated in writing by the Purchasers holding a majority of the Note Indebtedness.
