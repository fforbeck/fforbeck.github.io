This Warrant is issued in conjunction wi th the shares of the Company’s Common Stock issued pursuant to the Subscription Agreement dated as of [[Date 1]], by and between the Company and the Investor.

1.**Definitions****.** As used herein, the following terms shall have the following respective meanings:

^^“Aggregate Warrant Price” shall mean the dollar value obtained by multiplying $[[USD Value 1: Number]] by 215,285.

^^“Common Stock” shall mean the common stock of the Company.

^^“Exercise Period” shall mean the period commencing on [[Date 1]], and ending on [[Date 2: Date]].

^^“Exercise Price” shall mean $[[USD Value 1]] per share of Common Stock.

^^“Exercise Shares” shall mean any Common Stock acquired upon exercise of this Warrant.

^^“Share Number”, at any time, shall mean (i) the Aggregate Warrant Price minus the aggregate exercise price previously paid upon exercise of this Warrant, divided by (ii) the Exercise Price then in effect.

2.**Exercise of Warrant****.**  
^^**General; Exercise of Warrant** .  
^^The rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised as a whole or in part at any time during the Exercise Period, by delivery of the following to the Company at its address set forth above (or at such other address as it may designate by notice in writing to the Holder):

^^^An executed Notice of Exercise in the form attached hereto;

^^^Payment of the Exercise Price either in cash or by check; and

^^^This Warrant.  
^^Upon the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, a certificate or certificates for the Exercise Shares so purchased, registered in the name of the Holder or persons affiliated with the Holder, if the Holder so designates (and such designation is in compliance with applicable securities laws and any stockholders, investor rights or similar agreement), shall be issued and delivered to the Holder as promptly as practicable after the rights represented by this Warrant shall have been so exercised.

^^The person in whose name any certificate or certificates for Exercise Shares are to be issued upon exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares on the date on which this Warrant was surrendered and payment of the Exercise Price was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such certificate or certificates, except that, if the date of such surrender and payment is a date when the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the holder of such shares at the close of business on the next succeeding date on which the stock transfer books are open.

^^**Net Issue Exercise** .  
^^In lieu of paying the Exercise Price in cash or by check as provided in Section 2.1, the Holder may elect a “Net Issue Exercise” pursuant to which the Holder will receive Exercise Shares equal to the value (as determined below) of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being exercised) by surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company together with an executed Notice of Exercise in the form attached hereto in which event the Company shall issue to the Holder a number of Exercise Shares computed using the following formula:

^= Y (A-B) 
^Where:  
^= the number of Exercise Shares to be issued to the Holder;

^= the number of Exercise Shares purchasable under the Warrant or, if only a portion of the Warrant is being exercised, the portion of the Warrant being exercised (at the date of such exercise);

^= the Fair Market Value of one share of the Company’s Common Stock (at the date of such exercise); and

^= the Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such exercise).

^^For purposes of the above calculation, “Fair Market Value” shall be determined as follows:

^^^If the Common Stock is listed on any established stock exchange or a national market system, including, without limitation, The Nasdaq Stock Market’s Global Select or Global Market, the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock will be the average closing sales price for such stock (or the closing bid, if no sales are reported) as quoted on that system or exchange (or the system or exchange with the greatest volume of trading in Common Stock), over the five (5) trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the day the Warrant is being exercised, as reported in the Wall Street Journal or any other source the Company considers reliable.

^^^If the Common Stock is quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market ( but not on The Nasdaq Stock Market’s Global Select or Global Market) or is regularly quoted elsewhere by recognized securities dealers but selling prices are not reported, the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock will be the average mean between the high bid and low asked prices for the Common Stock over the five (5) trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the day the Warrant is being exercised, as reported in the Wall Street Journal or any other source the Company considers reliable.

^^^If the Common Stock is not traded as set forth above, the Fair Market Value will be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company.

^^If this Warrant is not exercised in full by a Net Issue Exercise, then, the “Share Number” in effect immediately after such partial exercise shall be appropriately adjusted to take into account the effect of the Net Issue Exercise.

3.**Covenants of the Company.**  
^^**Covenants as to Exercise Shares** . The Company covenants and agrees that all Exercise Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant will, upon issuance, be validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issuance thereof. The Company further covenants and agrees that the Company will at all times during the Exercise Period have authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, a sufficient number of shares of its Common Stock to provide for the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant. If at any time during the Exercise Period the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to permit exercise of this Warrant, the Company will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes.

^^**No Impairment** . Except and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the exercise rights of the Holder against impairment.
