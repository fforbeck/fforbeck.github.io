^^CBay Discontinues Certain Marketing Efforts. From and after the Effective Date until the Expiration Date, except as otherwise agreed upon in writing by MedQuist (following approval by the MedQuist Audit Committee) and CBay on a case-by-case basis, CBay will cease any New Customer sales efforts for Transcription Services to Hospitals in North America. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitation in the previous sentence will not restrict CBay from the following activities: 

^^Current Customer Relationships with Hospitals. Maintaining, developing and growing its relationships with current Hospital customers set forth on Schedule A (the “Current Customers Schedule”), including their Affiliates and existing, new, or subsequently acquired facilities of such persons (collectively, “Current Customers”) and servicing and providing additional work types/services for such Current Customers, including the Company’s products and services set forth on Schedule B (the “Current Products and Services Schedule”). 

^^Other Market Segments. Prospecting for New Customers in any other market segment, including, but not limited to, the Physician Practice market segment. 

^^Other Product/Service Categories. Selling any product/service, other than Transcription Services, to any Hospital, including but not limited to, Revenue Cycle Management products/services. 

^^Current Pipeline. Servicing and continuing its sales efforts to the Hospitals actively being pursued as of the date of this Agreement (“Current Pipeline Customers”), set forth on Schedule C (the “Current Pipeline Customers Schedule”), for twelve (12) months after the Effective Date. Unless the parties mutually agree to extend this twelve (12) month period (which agreement in the case of MedQuist will require the approval of the MedQuist Audit Committee), CBay will discontinue its sales efforts to any Hospitals that have not become customers as of twelve (12) months after the Effective Date. 

^^Marketing of Transcription Services. During the Term of this Agreement, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell and market Transcription Services to Hospitals in North America other than Current Customers and Current Pipeline Customers. With CBay’s express written consent, the Company may sell and market Transcription Services to any Current Customer, Current Pipeline Customer or facilities acquired by either Current 

*******    - Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

^^^^^ 

Customers or Current Pipeline Customers. CBay will provide the Company with such marketing assistance, technical information and other cooperation as is reasonably requested by the Company in connection with its marketing efforts. 

^^General Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, neither CBay nor MedQuist or their Affiliates shall be prohibited or restricted from acquiring, holding or investing in, directly or indirectly through any of its Affiliates, securities of an entity engaged in any business after the Effective Date, including the medical transcription business, the Hospital sector, and/or the Physician Practice market. The provisions of this Agreement will apply to any entity acquired after the Effective Date of this Agreement, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise (which agreement in the case of MedQuist will require the approval of the MedQuist Audit Committee). 

^^Group Purchasing Order Contracts. During the Term of this Agreement, CBay will cooperate with the Company to transfer, to the fullest extent permissible, the rights and benefits under CBay’s Group Purchasing Order (“GPO”) contracts set forth on Schedule D (the “GPO Contracts Schedule”) to the Company in order to allow MedQuist to market its products and services solely to New Customers that are Hospitals covered by such GPO contracts. If any such GPO contract cannot be transferred, CBay shall provide or cause to be provided all commercially reasonable assistance to the Company (not including the payment of any consideration) reasonably requested by the Company to secure any lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by the Company under which the Company shall obtain (without infringing upon the legal rights of any third party) the economic claims, rights and benefits under such GPO contract and shall assume any related economic burden with respect to such GPO contract. If any such GPO contract cannot be transferred, and CBay cannot facilitate MedQuist’s beneficial use of any such GPO contract pursuant to the previous sentence, then CBay shall contract for sales under such GPO contract and engage the Company to provide Transcription Services thereunder pursuant to the Subcontracting Agreement. 

\centered **OFFSHORE TRANSCRIPTION SERVICES** 

^^Termination of the TSA. The TSA is hereby terminated and superseded in its entirety by this Agreement, other than with respect to the payment of any fees or penalties for services provided under the TSA through the date of termination and Section 5.5 and Article VIII thereof, which provisions shall survive such termination and not be superseded solely with respect to services provided under the TSA through the date of termination. 

^^Exclusive Vendor Relationship. As of the Effective Date, until the Agreement is terminated or this provision ceases to be applicable in accordance with Sections 5.5 or 7.5 hereof, CBay shall be the Company’s exclusive provider of Indian or Asian Transcription Services, except as otherwise agreed upon in writing by MedQuist and CBay on a case-by-case basis, MedQuist will cease to directly or indirectly (except through CBay) purchase Indian or Asian Transcription Services from any person or entity other than CBay or perform Indian or Asian Transcription Services itself except pursuant to the Company’s International Labor Partner (“MQ ILP”) Vendor Contracts for Indian or Asian Transcription Services set forth on Schedule E 

*******    - Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

^^^^^ 

(“ILP Contracts”) prior to their assignment to CBay pursuant to Section 3.3. CBay shall provide the Indian or Asian Transcription Services at substantially the same level of quality as CBay provides similar services to its other clients, but in no event less than the standards customary in the industry. 

^^MedQuist’s Current International Labor Partner Vendor Contracts. As of the Effective Date the Company will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain consent, if required, for the assignment of the ILP Contracts from each MQ ILP. The Company will assign to CBay, and CBay will assume, each of the Company’s ILP Contracts in order to allow CBay to perform initially the necessary Indian or Asian Transcription Services for the Company promptly following its receipt of the consent of the MQ ILP party to such ILP Contract of such assignment. For purposes of clarity, following such assignment, CBay shall be solely responsible to MedQuist for the performance of all Indian and Asian Transcription Services and all other obligations under such ILP Contract and such services shall be deemed to be performed by or on behalf of CBay. Following the assignment of an ILP Contract, CBay shall have the right to amend, modify, terminate and replace ILP Contracts and vendors in its discretion, and MedQuist will not be entitled to any discounts, rebates, reductions in price or penalties under the ILP Contracts (except to the extent set forth in Section 3.4(h)). If any ILP does not consent to the assignment of its ILP Contract, the Company shall provide or cause to be provided all commercially reasonable assistance to CBay (not including the payment of any consideration) reasonably requested by CBay to secure such consent or cooperate with CBay (at CBay’s expense for any out-of pocket expenses) in any lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by CBay under which CBay shall obtain (without infringing upon the legal rights of any third party) the economic claims, rights and benefits under such ILP contract and shall assume any related economic burden with respect to such ILP contract. 

^^Pricing; Profit Sharing.  

^^ILP Contracts. With respect to any ILP Contract that is assigned to CBay, following such assignment, for Non-Client Ready Services performed under such ILP Contracts, CBay will bill the Company, and the Company agrees to pay CBay, the amount required to be paid for services under the ILP Contract at the rates in effect as of the Effective Date as set forth in Schedule E, regardless of the date of actual transfer of the ILP Contract or the date CBay begins or ceases to provide services under such contract (the “ILP Contract Rate”). For Client Ready Services performed under such ILP Contracts, CBay will bill the Company, and the Company agrees to pay CBay, the ILP Contract Rate plus *******. Upon termination of an ILP Contract in accordance with its terms, CBay will be paid the Services Fee under clause (b). 

^^Services Fee. For Indian or Asian Transcription Services provided by CBay other than through the ILP Contracts assigned to CBay, CBay will be paid at the rates set forth in Schedule F (the “Services Fee Schedule”) (subject to changes for currency fluctuation as described below) (the “Services Fee”). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Services Fee net of impact of amounts received by the Company pursuant to the Profit Sharing pursuant to Section 3.4(i) be greater than the fee charged by CBay to any other customer to whom it is providing substantially similar Transcription Services. 

*******    - Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

^^^^^ 

^^^Invoicing. An invoice for Service Fees will be generated by CBay twice each month and payment is due within thirty (30) calendar days after the Company’s receipt of the invoice and any other contractual reporting obligations of CBay due during the applicable billing period. 

^^Currency Fluctuation. If the average Rupee Exchange Rate during any three month period following the Effective Date (such rate, the “Adjusted Rupee Exchange Rate”) is [[Percentage 4: Number]]% higher or lower than the average Rupee Exchange Rate during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the Effective Date (such rate, the “Baseline Rupee Exchange Rate”), the prices charged by CBay for its Indian or Asian Transcription Services under this Agreement shall be adjusted upwards or downwards, as the case may be, by a factor equivalent to the ratio of the Baseline Rupee Exchange Rate to the Adjusted Rupee Exchange Rate. The most recent date on which such a modification occurs shall be deemed the “Exchange Rate Price Modification Date.” Once the prices have been modified pursuant to this paragraph, the first sentence of this paragraph shall be applied by replacing the words “Effective Date” with the words “Exchange Rate Price Modification Date” and adjustments may be made thereafter as set forth above. 

^^Additional Costs. If the Company requests a material change in the scope of the Transcription Services provided by CBay (including without limitation accelerated TAT times (2 hours instead of 12 hours) or significantly more nighttime work), and CBay informs the Company that such changes would increase CBay’s production costs over the costs that would be incurred if there were no material change in the scope of Transcription Services provided by CBay, then, in any such case, the expected additional costs, as specified in a new increased cost per line rate, shall have to be identified and agreed to by the Company before CBay begins performance of the Transcription Services incorporating the requested changes. If the Company agrees to the additional production costs resulting from the changes requested by the Company, as specified in a new increased cost per line rate, the Company shall thereafter pay CBay the increased per line rate. If the Company does not agree to the additional production costs resulting from the changes requested by the Company, as reflected in a specified increased cost per line rate, CBay will not perform the requested changes and the per line rate will remain constant. The parties shall work in good faith to minimize the amount of any cost increases resulting from material changes in the scope of the Transcription Services requested by the Company. 

^^CBay assumes all Taxes, Duties, Delivery and Installation Fees. CBay assumes responsibility for all excise, sales, use and similar taxes, export or import duties and shipment, and delivery or installation fees. 

^^Uncollected Services Fee. To the extent the Company cannot pay, or cause to be paid, the Services Fee for any reason, including by reason of any prohibition on such payment pursuant to any applicable law or the terms of any debt financing of the Company or its subsidiaries, the payment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to CBay of the Services Fee will be payable immediately on the earlier of (i) the first date on which the payment of such deferred Services Fee is no longer prohibited by law or 

*******    - Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

^^^^^ under any contract applicable to the Company and the Company is otherwise able to make such payment or cause such payment to be made, and (ii) total or partial liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, under any applicable law or under any contract applicable to the Company or its subsidiaries, any forbearance of collection of the Services Fee by CBay shall not be deemed to be a subordination of such payments to any other person, entity or creditor of the Company or its subsidiaries. Any installment of the Services Fee not paid on the scheduled due date will bear interest at an annual rate of six percent ([[Percentage 5: Number]]%), compounded quarterly, from the date due until paid. 

^^Disputed Services Fee. In the event that any invoiced amount is disputed by the Company, the Company shall deliver written notice of such disputed amount to CBay within thirty (30) calendar days after the date the invoice is due. Upon receipt of written notice of a billing dispute, CBay and Company shall promptly exchange any backup or other information reasonably necessary to support the correctness of any disputed amount. The parties shall thereafter have thirty (30) calendar days (“Invoice Review Period”) in which to examine such information, and to the extent such information substantiates payment, reductions or credits in the applicable invoice, such will be applied promptly. Thereafter, if CBay and the Company are unable to reach an agreement as to any remaining disputed amount, CBay and the Company shall immediately enter into good faith negotiations to resolve any remaining dispute, provided that in the case of MedQuist any resolution shall require the approval of the MedQuist Audit Committee. In the event the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within fifteen (15) calendar days after the end of the Invoice Review Period, the dispute shall be settled pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.12 of this Agreement. 

^^Penalties. The Company shall receive from CBay reimbursement for any actual penalties paid (whether in cash or by credit against future services) by the Company to its customers for Transcription Services performed either directly or indirectly (through an ILP Contract) by CBay which due to CBay’s action or inaction fail to meet the Quality Assurance or Turnaround Time performance requirements (as those terms are defined in the underlying contracts with the Company’s customers) under the contracts with such customers. 

^^^On a monthly basis, the Company shall submit to CBay any and all invoices, if any, for penalties paid by the Company to a customer due to CBay’s action or inaction as explained above. 

^^^CBay shall have 20 days to object to the Company’s conclusion that CBay’s action or inaction caused the Company to incur a penalty to its customer. If CBay objects, the parties will discuss the objection and try to resolve any disagreement in good faith (provided that in the case of MedQuist any resolution shall require the approval of the MedQuist Audit Committee), failing which the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with Section 11.12. If CBay does not object or the objection is resolved, then within 10 days thereafter CBay shall pay to the Company an amount in cash equal to the sum of the penalties paid by the Customer and submitted as invoices to CBay 

*******    - Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

^^^^^ under paragraph (i) above; provided that if CBay does not object to the full amount of the penalty, then CBay shall within 10 days of receipt of the invoice pay to the Company an amount in cash equal to the portion of the penalties as to which CBay is not objecting. Any penalties not paid on the due date set forth in this paragraph (ii) will bear interest at an annual rate of six percent ([[Percentage 5]]%), compounded quarterly, from the date due until paid. 

^^Profit Sharing. The Company shall be entitled to [[Percentage 1]]% of CBay’s Profit Sharing Amount (the “Company’s Share”) in each Fiscal Year of CBay. Within 60 days after the close of each Fiscal Year of CBay, the calculation of the Company’s Share will be reviewed as part of the annual audit and CBay shall prepare and submit to the Company a certificate, signed by CBay’s chief financial officer, specifying in reasonable detail the relevant calculation of the Revenues, Direct Production Costs, Indirect Production Costs and Profit Sharing Amount related to CBay’s Indian or Asian Transcription Services performed for the Company; and the results of its operations and cash flow for the relevant transactions, together with payment of the Company’s Share as set forth in the certificate. The Company shall have 21 days to object to the calculation set forth in the certificate. If the Company objects, the parties will discuss the objection and try to resolve any disagreement in good faith (which resolution in the case of MedQuist will require the approval of the MedQuist Audit Committee), failing which the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with Section 11.12. If the Company has objected to the calculation, then within 10 days following resolution of the objection, CBay shall pay to the Company (or the Company shall pay to CBay, as the case may be) an amount in cash equal to the difference, if any, between the Company’s Share as finally resolved and the Company’s Share as set forth in the certificate and previously paid. 

^^^Example. By way of example only, if CBay earns $[[USD Value 5: Number]] million in Revenue from Transcription Services sold to the Company, and $[[USD Value 6: Number]] million in Contribution Margin on such services, the Company would be entitled to a payment of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] according to the following calculations. Contribution Margin in excess of the Contribution Ratio would equal $[[USD Value 6]] million less $[[USD Value 7: Number]] million ([[Percentage 3]]% Contribution Ratio on $[[USD Value 5]] million in Transcription Services Revenues), or $[[USD Value 8: Number]] million of which [[Percentage 1]]%, or $[[USD Value 2: Number]] would be paid to the Company. 

^^Excess Quality Assurance Expense. The Company shall have the right to charge, and CBay shall pay, an amount equal to the Excess Quality Assurance Expense as explained in Schedule F. 

^^Books of Account. Appropriate records and books of account of CBay’s transactions with, and the provision of services to, the Company under this Agreement shall be maintained by CBay in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. Such records and books of account shall at all times be maintained at such place of business of CBay as shall have been notified to the Company. The books of account and the records of CBay shall be audited as of the end of each Fiscal Year by its independent auditors. All such records shall be maintained during the Term of this Agreement, or such longer period as may be required by relevant Law. 

*******    - Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

^^^^^ 

^^Inspection Rights of the Company. The Company, and any accountants, attorneys, financial advisers and other representatives of the Company, may, from time to time at the Company’s sole expense, visit and inspect the properties of CBay, examine (and make copies and extracts of) CBay’s books, records and documents solely for purposes of confirming the calculation of Revenues, Direct Production Costs, Indirect Production Costs, Contribution Margin, the Profit Sharing Amount and the Company’s Share related to the Indian or Asian Transcription Services provided by CBay to the Company under this Agreement, and may discuss those transactions with its officers, employees and independent accountants, all at such reasonable times as the Company may request on reasonable notice. 

^^Other Information. Upon the reasonable request of the Company, CBay shall, to the extent reasonably practicable without interfering unduly with the ongoing operation and management of CBay’s business and without imposing any significant expense or cost on CBay, prepare and furnish, or cause to be prepared and furnished, to the Company, as soon as practicable following such request, any additional financial or operating information or reports as are so reasonably requested by the Company, related to determining Revenues, Direct Production Costs, Indirect Production Costs, Contribution Margin, the Profit Sharing Amount and the Company’s Share.

**Notes**
^^MQ production is currently carried out at all captive production facilities. Of these CTU4,CTU5,CTU7,CKAR-DSK and CTS are fully dedicated to MQ production.
^^MQ work is carried out in a secured, enclosed environment with access controls and restrictions. G&A costs are therefore allocated on seat basis
^^The current account codes, groups etc could change in the event of software upgradation, integration, account code streamlining etc. These are ongoing activities.

**Example of Direct Labor Cost Allocation:** 

**The transcriptionist labor costs (wages, bonuses, fringe benefits, and incentives) for individuals or facilities that are identifiable and dedicated to production work for MedQuist would be charged to MedQuist production volumes. However, such costs for individuals or facilities that are performing transcription for both MedQuist and other customers, will be allocated between MedQuist and the other customers based upon the most direct method possible or based upon a ratio of MedQuist volume to total production volume. An example follows:** 

**If labor costs at the CTU4 facility was $[[USD Value 1]] and all production volume from CTU4 is for MQ, the labor cost pool charged to MQ would be $[[USD Value 1]]**

**If labor costs at Ckar was $[[USD Value 3: Number]] and it could not be allocated more directly (either by individual or work group) and MQ accounted for [[Percentage 7: Number]]% of the total production at Ckar, then [[Percentage 7]]% of the cost or $[[USD Value 4: Number]] would be allocated to MQ.**
