^**Grant of Stock Unit Award** 

^^*Grant of Stock Units.* The Company hereby grants to the Grantee a number of Stock Units to be determined by the Company immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger, which number will be equal to $[] divided by the Per Share Common Amount, as defined in the Merger Agreement, and communicated to the Grantee as soon as reasonably practicable following the closing date of the Merger (the “**Award**”) on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and as otherwise provided in the Plan. 

^^*Incorporation of Plan; Capitalized Terms.* The provisions of the Plan are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and any capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the definitions set forth in the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall have final authority to interpret and construe the Plan and this Agreement and to make any and all determinations thereunder, and its decision shall be binding and conclusive upon the Grantee and his/her legal representative in respect of any questions arising under the Plan or this Agreement. 

^**Terms and Conditions of Award** 

The grant of Stock Units provided in Section 1(a) shall be subject to the following terms, conditions and restrictions: 

^^*Limitations on Rights Associated with Units.* The Stock Units are bookkeeping entries only. The Grantee shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, no dividend rights and no voting rights with respect to the Stock Units. 

^^*Restrictions.* Stock Units and any interest therein, may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, during the Restricted Unit Period (as defined below). Any attempt to dispose of any Stock Units in contravention of the above restriction shall be null and void and without effect. 

^^*Lapse of Restrictions.* Except as otherwise provided herein, one-third (1/3) of the Stock Units subject to the Award shall vest and become non-forfeitable on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Date of Grant. (The period commencing on the Date of Grant and ending on the date the Stock Units vest is referred to as the “**Restricted Unit Period**.”) 

^^*Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units.* As soon as practicable after (and in no case more than 74 days after) the date any Stock Units subject to the Award become non-forfeitable (the “**Payment Date**”), such Stock Units shall be paid by the Company delivering to the Grantee, a number of shares of Common Stock (“**Shares**”) equal to the number of Stock Units that become non-forfeitable upon that Payment Date. The Company shall issue the Shares either (i) in certificate form or (ii) in book entry form, registered in the name of the Grantee. Delivery of any certificates will be made to the Grantee’s last address reflected on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless the Company is otherwise instructed in writing. Neither the Grantee nor any of the Grantee’s successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall have any further rights or interests in any Stock Units that are so paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares in payment of the Stock Units unless such issuance and such payment shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and the requirements of any applicable securities exchange. 

^^*Termination of Employment.* In the event of the termination of Grantee’s employment or service with the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary for any reason prior to the lapsing of the restrictions in accordance with Section 2(c) hereof with respect to any of the Stock Units granted hereunder, such portion of the Stock Units held by Grantee shall be automatically forfeited by the Grantee as of the date of termination. Neither the Grantee nor any of the Grantee’s successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall have any rights or interests in any Stock Units that are so forfeited. 

^^*Corporate Transactions.* The following provisions shall apply to the corporate transactions described below: 

^^^In the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Award will terminate and be forfeited immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction, unless otherwise provided by the Plan Administrator. 

^^^In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, the Award shall be assumed or substituted with an equivalent award by such successor corporation, parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation; provided that the Plan Administrator may determine, in the exercise of its sole discretion in connection with a transaction that constitutes a permissible distribution event under Section 409A(a)(2)(v) of the Code, that in lieu of such assumption or substitution, the Award shall be vested and non-forfeitable and any conditions or restrictions on the Award shall lapse, as to all or any part of the Award, including Stock Units as to which the Award would not otherwise be non-forfeitable. 

^^*Income Taxes.* Except as provided in the next sentence, the Company shall withhold and/or reacquire a number of Shares issued in payment of (or otherwise issuable in payment of, as the case may be) the Stock Units having a Fair Market Value equal to the taxes that the Company determines it or any Parent or Subsidiary is required to withhold under applicable tax laws with respect to the Stock Units (with such withholding obligation determined based on any applicable minimum statutory withholding rates). In the event the Company cannot (under applicable legal, regulatory, listing or other requirements, or otherwise) satisfy such tax withholding obligation in such method or in the event that the Stock Units are paid in cash (as opposed to Shares), the Company may satisfy such withholding by any one or combination of the following methods: (i) by requiring the Grantee to pay such amount in cash or check; (ii) by reducing the amount of any cash otherwise payable to Grantee with respect to the Stock Units; (iii) by deducting such amount out of any other compensation otherwise payable to the Grantee; and/or (iv) by allowing the Grantee to surrender shares of Common Stock of the Company which (a) in the case of shares initially acquired from the Company (upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise), have been owned by the Grantee for such period (if any) as may be required to avoid a charge to the Company’s earnings, and (b) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the amount required to be withheld;. For these purposes, the Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or repurchased, as applicable, shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. 

^**Miscellaneous** 

^^*Notices.* Any and all notices, designations, consents, offers, acceptances and any other communications provided for herein shall be given in writing and shall be delivered either personally or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, which shall be addressed, in the case of the Company to both the Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel of the Company at the principal office of the Company and, in the case of the Grantee, to the Grantee’s address appearing on the books of the Company or to the Grantee’s residence or to such other address as may be designated in writing by the Grantee. 

^^*No Right to Continued Employment.* Nothing in the Plan or in this Agreement shall confer upon the Grantee any right to continue in the employ of the Company, a Parent or any Subsidiary or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the right of the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary, which is hereby expressly reserved, to remove, terminate or discharge the Grantee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without Cause and with or without advance notice.

^^*Headings.* The headings of the Sections hereof are provided for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction, and shall not constitute a part, of this Agreement. 

^^*Counterparts.* This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
