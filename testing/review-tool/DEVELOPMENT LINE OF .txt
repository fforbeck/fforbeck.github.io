THIS DEVELOPMENT LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT (this “**Agreement**”), dated as of [[Date 1: Date]], is entered into by and between the borrowing entities identified on Exhibit A attached hereto (jointly and severally, the “**Borrower**”), DIVERSIFIED RESTAURANT HOLDINGS, INC., a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]], acting as “**Borrowing Agent**” for Borrower, and RBS CITIZENS, N.A., a national banking association, and its successors and assigns (the “**Lender**”). 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 

^Loan Terms.  
^^Amount of Loan. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Lender shall make a loan to Borrower in the maximum principal amount of Six Million and no/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]) (the “**Loan**”), which is the maximum aggregate amount of DLOC Advances that may be made and converted to a Term Loan pursuant to this Agreement. Borrower’s obligation to repay the Loan shall be evidenced by a promissory note substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the “**Note**”). During the Draw Period, DLOC Advances will be made in accordance with Section 2 of this Agreement. From and after the Term Loan Effective Date, no additional DLOC Advances will be available. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement and the Loan Documents to the contrary, during the Draw Period the Loan is a straight line of credit and not a revolving line of credit and, accordingly, principal amounts paid and prepaid may not be re-borrowed or re-advanced. The DLOC Advances will be converted to a Term Loan on the Term Loan Effective Date, as provided in this Agreement. 

^^Maturity Date.  
^^^Each DLOC Advance together with any accrued and unpaid interest shall, in the aggregate, be converted to a Term Loan on the Term Loan Effective Date. 

^^^The Term Loan shall have a term of sixty-six (66) months from the first day of the first month after the Term Loan Effective Date. The Term Loan shall mature and be due and payable in full on [[Date 2: Date]] (the “**Maturity Date**”). 

^^^On the Maturity Date, in addition to any required Monthly Payment, Borrower shall also pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to the Loan, together with any other amounts payable under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 

^^Payments.  
^^^Interest on each DLOC Advance shall be due and payable in arrears on the fifth (5th) day of each month following the Closing Date. Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to automatically deduct from any deposit account of Borrower each monthly payment of interest and any other fees the Lender may assess Borrower from time to time pursuant to this Agreement. If the funds in the account are insufficient to cover any payment due to Lender, Lender will not be obligated to advance funds to cover the payment. Failure of Lender to charge any account or to give any notice shall not affect the obligation of Borrower to pay all amounts due hereunder or under the Note. 

^^^^^ 
^^^With respect to the Term Loan, Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to automatically deduct from any deposit account of Borrower for each Monthly Payment based upon the Term Loan Period, payable on or before the eighth (8th) day of each month, beginning on the eighth (8th) day of the first (1st) month following the Term Loan Effective Date and continuing on the last day of each succeeding month thereafter (each a “**Term Loan Payment Date**”) until the Maturity Date, along with any other fees the Lender may assess Borrower from time to time pursuant to this Agreement. All outstanding payments of interest, principal, and other sums shall be paid in full on the Maturity Date. If the funds in the account are insufficient to cover any payment due to Lender, Lender will not be obligated to advance funds to cover the payment. Failure of Lender to charge any account or to give any notice shall not affect the obligation of Borrower to pay all amounts due hereunder or under the Note. 

^^^Borrower shall pay Lender a fee in an amount equal to one-quarter percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) per annum on the unused portion of the Loan during the Draw Period, calculated using the average balance of the Note, such fee to be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December, commencing on the last day of [[Date 3: Date]]. Any unused fee that has accrued and not paid shall be due and payable on the Term Loan Effective Date. 

^^Interest.  
^^^Interest shall be set and accrue beginning on the first date a DLOC Advance is made by Lender to Borrower and shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the LIBOR Advantage Rate for such LA Interest Period plus the LA Margin. 

^^^Upon the Term Loan Effective Date, the principal sum outstanding on the Loan shall bear interest at the Term Interest Rate. All computations of interest shall be computed upon the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year consisting of 360 days. 

^^^Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and while such Event of Default is continuing, the Term Interest Rate on the Loan shall increase by five percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) per annum over the existing Interest Rate, compounded annually (the “**Default Rate**”). 

^^^Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Interest Rate charged on the Loan exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted under applicable state and/or federal usury law. Any payment of interest that would be deemed unlawful under applicable law for any reason shall be deemed received on account of, and will automatically be applied to reduce, the principal sum outstanding on the Loan and any other sums (other than interest) due and payable to Lender under this Agreement, and the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed amended to provide for the highest rate of interest permitted under applicable law. 

^^Use of Proceeds. Each DLOC Advance shall be used in connection with the development and operation of Buffalo Wild Wings franchised locations and the development and operation of Bagger Dave’s locations as follows: 

^^^^^ 
^^^up to seventy percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the development cost for Buffalo Wild Wings locations; or

^^^purchases of real estate, limited to the lesser of eighty percent ([[Percentage 5: Number]]%) of appraised value of the said real estate or eighty percent ([[Percentage 5]]%) of the purchase price of said real estate. Any DLOC Advance related to the purchase of real estate (**“Real Estate Advance”**) shall be subject to receipt of satisfactory real estate appraisals, environmental reports, construction monitoring (including architectural inspection) (collectively, the **“Real Estate Due Diligence”**) and such other items as may be required by Lender including, but not limited to the filing of mortgages (including leasehold mortgages), in Lender’s sole discretion 

Borrower acknowledges that appropriate documentation, as requested by Lender, may be required prior to any DLOC Advance and that no more than twenty-five percent ([[Percentage 6: Number]]%) of the Loan shall be apportioned to Bagger Dave’s locations. No DLOC Advance shall be used for personal, family, or household purposes. 

^^Transaction Costs; Reimbursement of Expenses. On the Closing Date, Borrower shall pay Lender a sum equal to all of Lender’s transaction-related expenses, including attorneys’ fees and costs and fees for real estate evaluations, background checks, transaction related travel, any and all required due diligence and Lender’s closing fee, all of which will be in addition to any commitment or related fees due to Lender. In addition, Borrower shall reimburse Lender for all fees, costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with the exercise of Lender’s rights and duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the preservation and protection of the Collateral, and the enforcement or attempted enforcement of Borrower’s obligations under the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees. Further, Borrower shall reimburse Lender for all trustee, receiver and property manager fees and commissions and all costs, expenses and charges incurred by those parties in connection with this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Collateral.
