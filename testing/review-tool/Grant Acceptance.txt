The RSA Award represents the method of payment selected by the Committee for a portion of each of the following installments of your Earned Award under the Company’s Senior Executive Performance Incentive Plan (As Amended and Restated Effective [[Date 2: Date]]) (the “Performance Plan”): [[Date 3: Date]], [[Date 4: Date]] and [[Date 5: Date]]. The RSA Award equals % of % of the portion of your Earned Award due on each such installment date.

On each such installment date, one-third of the RSA Award will vest, subject to forfeiture or acceleration as provided in Article IV and Section 5.2 of the Performance Plan. 

The Restricted Shares included in the RSA Award will be registered in your name in a restricted shares account with the Company’s transfer agent. The Restricted Shares will remain in the custody or otherwise under the control of the Company or its designee until vesting, and you hereby agree to provide the Company a stock power substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, endorsed in blank, so as to permit retransfer to the Company of all or any portion of the Restricted Shares that shall be forfeited or otherwise not become vested in accordance with the Performance Plan. 

The RSA Award shall constitute issued and outstanding shares of the Company for all corporate purposes. You hereby contractually agree not to vote any of the Restricted Shares or to permit any other person, whether by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise, to vote any of the Restricted Shares prior to vesting thereof. Subject to the foregoing and to the limitations the LGI Incentive Plan with respect to Restricted Shares issued prior to vesting, you will have all rights, powers and privileges of a holder of common stock of the same series with respect to the Restricted Shares included in the RSA Award. Such limitations on your rights as a stockholder with respect to such Restricted Shares will cease at such time as the Restricted Shares vest and are delivered to you.

The RSA Award is subject to all of the terms and conditions of your Participation Certificate, the Performance Plan and the LGI Incentive Plan, and administrative interpretations of the Committee under the Performance Plan and LGI Incentive Plan. 

As soon as practicable after the vesting of the Restricted Shares included in the RSA Award, and subject to the withholding referred to below, the Company will cause to be delivered to you a statement of holdings reflecting that the applicable number of shares of Common Stock, free of restrictions, are held for your benefit in uncertificated form by the third party service provider designated by the Company (currently UBS Financial Services Inc.). Delivery will be deemed effected for all purposes when the statement of holdings reflecting such shares of Common Stock has been delivered personally to you or, if delivery is by mail, when the statement of holdings has been deposited in the United States mail, addressed to you.

To the extent that the Company is subject to withholding tax requirements under any national, state, local or other governmental law with respect to the vesting of all or any portion of the RSA Award, the Company shall withhold from the shares of Common Stock represented by the vested Restricted Shares and otherwise deliverable to you a number of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld by the Company under such tax laws in connection with the vesting of such Restricted Shares, as determined by the Company (the “Required Withholding Amount”), unless you remit the Required Withholding Amount to the Company in cash in such form and by such time as the Company may require or other provisions for withholding such amount satisfactory to the Company have been made. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Grant Acceptance, the delivery of any shares of Common Stock represented by vested Restricted Shares may be postponed until any required withholding taxes have been paid to the Company.
