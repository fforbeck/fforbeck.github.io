^^If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time after the issuance of the Shares and until such time as the Purchaser no longer owns any shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement (including shares issued pursuant to this Section 5.3) or six (6) months after the date of this Agreement, whichever occurs first, issue shares of Common Stock, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for shares of Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities without consideration or for consideration per share (including, in the case of such options, rights, or securities, the additional consideration required to be paid to the Company upon exercise, conversion or exchange) less than the Effective Price Per Share (as hereinafter defined) (each such issuance, a “Triggering Issuance”), then (i) the Company shall issue to the Purchaser, for no additional consideration, such number of shares of Common Stock which when aggregated with the Shares issued hereunder to Purchaser prior to the applicable Triggering Issuance would result in an effective purchase price per share of Common Stock to the Purchaser (calculated by dividing the Purchase Price by such aggregate number of shares) equal to the effective price per share of Common Stock of the Triggering Issuance (calculated by dividing the total consideration received by the Company for such issuance (as determined below) divided by the number of shares issued (as determined below)), and (ii) the Effective Price Per Share shall be adjusted to equal the effective price per share of Common Stock of the Triggering Issuance. “Effective Price Per Share” shall mean $[[USD Value 4: Number]], as subsequently adjusted pursuant to this Section 5.3.

^^For the purposes of calculating the number of shares of Common Stock issuable and the adjustment in the Effective Price Per Share pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 5.3, the following provisions shall be applicable: 

^^^In the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock for cash in a public offering or private placement, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting therefrom any discounts, commissions or placement fees payable by the Company to any underwriter or placement agent in connection with the issuance and sale thereof. 

^^^In the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Warrant) thereof. 

^^^In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for shares of Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities: 

^the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Company upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum purchase price provided in such options or rights for the shares of Common Stock covered thereby; 

^the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, exercise, or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion, exercise or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities, options, or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration received by the Company for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Company upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights; 

^no further adjustment of the Effective Price Per Share adjusted upon the issuance of any such options, rights, convertible securities or exchangeable securities shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of Common Stock or the exercise of any such rights or options or any conversion or exchange of any such securities. 

^Extraordinary Events Regarding Common Stock. In the event that the Company shall (a) issue additional shares of the Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution on outstanding Common Stock or any preferred stock issued by the Company, (b) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock, (c) combine its outstanding shares of the Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of the Common Stock, then, in each such event, the Effective Price Per Share shall be adjusted to a number determined by multiplying the Effective Price Per Share immediately prior to any such event by a fraction of which (a) the numerator is the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately prior to any such event, and (b) the denominator is the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately after to any such event. 

^Lock Up Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Shares, the Warrant Shares, and any additional shares issuable in connection with this Agreement or the Warrant, shall be “Common Stock” under, and subject to, that certain Lock-Up Letter Agreement executed on or about [[Date 5: Date]] by the Purchaser in favor of the Company for effectiveness as of [[Date 6: Date]].
