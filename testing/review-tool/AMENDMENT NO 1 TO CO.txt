“SECTION 6.9. Additional Backstops.

^^The Company may, at its option, include in the Plan an offering (the “GGP Backstop Rights Offering”) to its then-existing holders of Common Stock of rights to purchase New Common Stock on the Effective Date in an amount sufficient to yield to the Company aggregate net proceeds on the Effective Date of up to $[[USD Value 4: Number]] or such lesser amount as the Company may determine (the “GGP Backstop Rights Offering Amount”). In connection with the GGP Backstop Rights Offering:

^^^Purchaser and the Pershing Investors (together with the Purchaser, the “Backstop Investors”) and the Company shall appoint a mutually-acceptable and internationally-recognized investment bank to act as bookrunning dealer-manager for the GGP Backstop Rights Offering (the “Dealer Manager”) pursuant to such arrangements as they may mutually agree;

^^^the Dealer Manager will, no later than the fifth business day in advance of the commencement of the solicitation of votes on the Plan and offering of rights in the GGP Backstop Rights Offering (which shall not be longer than 60 days), recommend in writing to the Backstop Investors and the Company the number of shares of New Common Stock that may be purchased for each share of Common Stock, the subscription price of such purchase and the other terms for the rights offering that the Dealer Manager determines are reasonably likely to yield committed proceeds to the Company at the Effective Date equal to the GGP Backstop Rights Offering Amount (it being understood that the Dealer Manager will have no liability if it is later determined that its good faith determination was erroneous);

^^^the Backstop Investors agree, severally but not jointly and severally, to subscribe, or cause one or more designees to subscribe, for New Common Stock on a pro rata basis to the extent rights are declined by holders of Common Stock, subject to the subscription rights among the Backstop Investors set forth in clause (iv);

^^^the Backstop Investors will have subscription rights in any such offering allowing them to maintain their respective proportionate pro forma New Common Stock - -equivalent interests on a Fully Diluted Basis with the effect that the Backstop Investors will be assured of the ability to acquire such number of shares of New Common Stock as would have been available to them pursuant to Section 5.9 had the GGP Backstop Rights Offering been made after the Closing;

^^^the Backstop Investors will receive aggregate compensation in the form of New Common Stock (whether or not the backstop commitments are utilized) with a value equal to three percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the GGP Backstop Rights Offering Amount; and

^^^the amount of New Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to the GGP Backstop Rights Offering will be subject to reduction to the extent that either (A) the Company Board determines in its business judgment after consultation with the Backstop Investors that it has sufficient liquidity and working capital available to it in light of circumstances at the time and the costs and benefits to the Company of consummation of the GGP Backstop Rights Offering or (B) the Backstop Investors have agreed that they will provide to the Company, in lieu of the GGP Backstop Rights Offering, the Bridge Securities contemplated in clause (b) below.

^^The Company shall give each Backstop Investor written notice of its estimate of the amount the Backstop Investors will be required to fund pursuant to Section 6.9(a) no later than six (6) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If each Backstop Investor agrees, the Backstop Investors shall have two (2) Business Days from the date of receipt of such notice to notify the Company in writing that they intend to elect to purchase from the Company in lieu of all or part of the proceeds to be provided by the GGP Backstop Rights Offering its pro rata portion of senior subordinated unsecured notes and/or preferred stock instruments (at the election of the Backstop Investors) on market terms except as provided below (the “Bridge Securities”). The Bridge Securities would have a final maturity date, in the case of a note, and a mandatory redemption date, in the case of preferred stock, on the 270th day after the Effective Date, would not require any mandatory interim cash distributions except as contemplated in (i) below, and would yield to the Company on the Closing Date cash proceeds (net of OID) of at least the proceeds from the GGP Backstop Rights Offering that such Bridge Securities are intended to replace. The Bridge Securities would be subordinated in right of payment to any New Debt, would have market coupon and fees, would allow for any interest due prior to maturity to be “paid in kind” (rather than paid in cash) at the election of the Company, would be prepayable, without any prepayment penalty or prepayment premium, on a pro rata basis at any time, and would otherwise be on market terms (determined such that fair value of the Bridge Securities as of the Effective Date is equal to par minus OID).

If the GGP Backstop Rights Offering is completed or the Bridge Securities are issued:

^^^unless the Backstop Investors otherwise agree, the Bridge Securities shall be subject to mandatory prepayment on a pro rata basis out of the proceeds of any equity or debt securities offered or sold by the Company at any time the Bridge Securities are outstanding (other than the New Common Stock sold to the Backstop Investors, any New Common Stock sold in the GGP Backstop Rights Offering and the New Debt); and

^^^if the Bridge Securities are issued and not repaid on or before the date that is thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, the Company shall conduct a rights offering in an amount equal to the outstanding amount due with respect to the Bridge Securities and with a pro rata backstop by each applicable Backstop Investor on substantially the same procedure and terms provided in clause (a) above, with such rights offering to have a subscription period of not more than 30 days that ends no later than the 10th day prior to the final maturity date or mandatory redemption of the Bridge Securities.

^^If the Company requests Purchaser and the Fairholme/Pershing Investors (collectively, the “Initial Investors”), in writing, at any time prior to fifteen (15) days before the commencement of solicitation of acceptances of the Plan, each Initial Investor agrees that it shall, severally but not jointly and severally, provide or cause a designee to provide its pro rata share of a backstop for new bonds, loans or preferred stock (as determined by the Initial Investor) in an aggregate amount equal to $[[USD Value 5: Number]] less the Reinstated Amounts, at a market rate and market commitment fees, and otherwise on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed among the Initial Investors and the Company. The new bonds, loans or preferred stock would require no mandatory interim cash principal payments prior to the third anniversary of issuance (unless funded from committed junior indebtedness or junior preferred stock), and would yield proceeds to the Company on the Closing Date net of OID of at least $[[USD Value 5]] less the Reinstated Amounts. Any Initial Investor may at any time designate in writing one or more financial institutions with a corporate investment grade credit rating (from S&P or Moody’s) to make a substantially similar undertaking as that provided herein and, upon the receipt of such an undertaking by the Company in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, such Initial Investor shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement, the Fairholme Agreement or the Pershing Agreement, as applicable.

^^For the purposes of Section 6.9(a) and Section 6.9(b), the “pro rata share” or “pro rata basis” of each Backstop Investor shall be determined in accordance with the maximum number of shares of New Common Stock each Backstop Investor has committed to purchase at Closing pursuant to the Pershing Agreement or this Agreement, as applicable, as of the date hereof, in relation to the aggregate maximum number of shares of New Common Stock all Backstop Investors have committed to purchase at Closing pursuant to the Pershing Agreement or this Agreement, as applicable, as of the date hereof. For the purposes of Section 6.9(c), the “pro rata share” or “pro rata basis” of each Initial Investor shall be determined in accordance with the maximum number of shares of New Common Stock each Initial Investor has committed to purchase at Closing pursuant to the Fairholme/Pershing Agreements or this Agreement, as applicable, as of the date hereof, but excluding any shares of New Common Stock the Backstop Investors have committed to purchase pursuant to this Section 6.9.”
