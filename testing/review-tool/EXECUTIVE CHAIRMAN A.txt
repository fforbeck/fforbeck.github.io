employees, including, without limitation, its Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (the “Code of Business Conduct”). 

^^Executive may not engage, directly or indirectly, in any other business, investment, or activity that interferes with Executive’s performance of duties hereunder, is contrary to the interest of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or requires any significant portion of Executive’s business time. The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties recognize and agree that Executive may engage in passive personal investments and other business activities that do not conflict with the business and affairs of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or interfere with Executive’s performance of his duties hereunder. Executive will annually provide the Compensation Committee of the Board a list of the boards of organizations not affiliated with the Company on which he serves. 

^Term.  

^^Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the term of this Agreement shall be from the Effective Date until [[Date 2: Date]] (the “Employment Period”) at which time Executive irrevocably agrees that he will announce to employees and customers or others deemed appropriate by the Chief Executive Officer or the Board, in a manner and form approved by the Chief Executive Officer, of his change in status to senior advisor, as provided in Section 3(c)(ii). 

^^Following Executive’s ceasing, for whatever reason, to be an employee of the Company, each party shall have the right to enforce all its rights, and shall be bound by all obligations, that are continuing rights and obligations under the terms of this Agreement. 

^^In consideration of the economic consideration provided in this Agreement and Executive’s representations in Section 3(a) above, which are material hereto, and only in the event Executive retires from the Company on [[Date 2]], then: 

^^^The Company agrees that, notwithstanding the terms of the [[Company]] 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as the Board may amend it from time to time (the “Stock Incentive Plan”), all of Executive’s stock options and restricted stock (other than the stock options and restricted stock granted in Section 4(c) hereof) will be vested, and 

^^^The Company shall engage Executive as a senior advisor until [[Date 3: Date]] for which Executive would be paid $[[USD Value 1: Number]] annually, provided Executive executes the Company’s form of senior advisor agreement. 

^Compensation and Benefits. Executive shall be entitled to the compensation and other benefits provided in this Section 4 during the Employment Period. 

^^Salary.

Such restricted stock and stock options shall be governed by the terms of the Stock Incentive Plan, including the three year vesting period.

^^Savings, Retirement and Other Incentive Plans. Executive shall be eligible to participate in all savings, retirement and other incentive plans generally available to the Company’s executive officers.

^^the Company shall pay to Executive, his estate or succession in one lump-sum payment within 30 days after the date of such termination (except as otherwise specified in Section 16(a)), an amount equal to Executive’s Base Pay and target bonus for the remaining term of the Agreement (using the Base Pay rate in effect on the termination date and the target bonus

^Nondisclosure.  

^^Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

^^^^^ 
violation of an obligation of confidentiality to the Company), whether produced by the Company, Executive or a third party for the Company, and whether or not marked confidential, including, without limitation, information relating to the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ products and services, business plans, business acquisitions, processes, product or service research and development methods or techniques, training methods and other operational methods or techniques, quality assurance procedures or standards, operating procedures, files, plans, specifications, proposals, drawings, charts, graphs, support data, trade secrets, supplier lists, supplier information, purchasing methods or practices, distribution and selling activities, consultants’ reports, marketing and engineering or other technical studies, maintenance records, employment or personnel data, marketing data, strategies or techniques, financial reports, budgets, projections, cost analyses, price lists and analyses, employee lists, customer lists, customer source lists, proprietary computer software; and internal notes and memoranda relating to any of the foregoing. 

^^^“Company’s Business” means any of the following: (a) manufacturing, selling or renting specialized tools or equipment for use with onshore and offshore oil and gas well drilling, completion, production, workover, fishing and related activities; (b) providing oil and gas well intervention services, including, without limitation, coiled tubing, electric wireline, mechanical wireline, pumping and stimulation, artificial lift, well control, snubbing, recompletion, engineering, well evaluation and related services; (c) providing oilfield decommissioning or plugging and abandonment services; (d) chartering or operating liftboats or other similar oilfield service vessels; (e) providing oilfield waste management and environmental cleaning services; and (f) acquiring, producing, developing and operating mature offshore oil and gas producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico. 

^^Nondisclosure of Confidential Information. Executive shall use all Confidential Information solely within the scope of his employment with and for the Company’s exclusive benefit. At the end of the Employment Period, Executive agrees (i) not to communicate, divulge or make available to any person or entity (other than the Company) any such Confidential Information, except on the Company’s prior written authorization or as may be required by law or legal process, and (ii) to deliver promptly to the Company any Confidential Information in his possession. If any applicable law or any court order would require Executive to disclose or otherwise make available any Confidential Information, Executive shall give the Company prompt prior written notice of such required disclosure and an opportunity to contest the requirement of such disclosure or apply for a protective order with respect to such Confidential Information by appropriate proceedings. 

^^Non-Disparagement Covenant. Throughout the term of this Agreement and for the greater of 12 months thereafter or the maximum period allowed by law, Executive agrees that he shall not openly make or publish written or oral statements or remarks in an effort materially to disparage or damage the integrity, reputation or good will of the Company or its management, products or services. 

^^Injunctive Relief. The parties acknowledge that the intentional and material breach of any of paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section 7 may cause immediate and 

\centered 

[[Executive]] Executive Chairman Agreement    Page 5    Effective [[Date 1]]  

^^^^^ 
irreparable harm for which an adequate monetary remedy does not exist; hence, the parties agree that, if a breach of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this Section 7 during or after the Employment Period, shall entitle the non-breaching party to seek injunctive relief to restrain any violation of such paragraphs without the necessity of proof of actual damage or the posting of any bond, except as required by non-waivable, applicable law, if (i) the enforcing party first provides written notice to the breaching party of the details of the alleged breach and, within 14 days and following good faith negotiations, Executive and the Company are unable to satisfactorily resolve the alleged breach, and (ii) the alleged breach is intentional, significant and material. Subject to Section 9 (concerning arbitration), nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company or Executive from pursuing any other remedy at law or in equity to which each may be entitled under applicable law if either breaches this Agreement, including, but not limited to, enforcing any party’s separate obligations to the other (such as, for example, any option or restricted stock agreement), recovery of costs and expenses such as reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by reason of any such breach, and actual damages sustained as a result of any such breach. The prevailing party in any court action shall be entitled to recover reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees and costs, including costs for expert witnesses. 

^^Executive’s Understanding of this Section. The provisions of this Section 7 are supplemental to and do not supersede Executive’s obligations under applicable law, regulation, or policy. Executive understands and acknowledges that the Company has made substantial investments in its business, including its goodwill and Confidential Information. Executive agrees that such investments are worthy of protection, and that the Company’s need for the protection afforded by this Section 7 is greater than any hardship Executive might experience by complying with its terms. Executive hereby represents to the Company that he has read and understands, and agrees to be bound by, the terms of this Section 7. 

^Successors. This Agreement and all Executive’s rights hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive’s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. 

^Arbitration. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the Company and Executive agree to submit exclusively to final and binding arbitration any and all disputes or disagreements relating this Agreement (other than to obtain injunctive relief to enforce Executive’s obligations under Section 7) according to the National Rules for the resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) using a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall take place in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Executive and the Company agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties. Each party in such an arbitration proceeding shall be responsible for the costs and expenses incurred by such party in connection therewith (including attorneys’ fees) which shall not be subject to recovery from the other party in the arbitration. Any and all charges that may be made for the cost of the arbitration and the fees of the arbitrator shall be paid equally by both parties. If there is litigation to enforce an arbitration award in connection with or concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and disbursements incurred by such party in connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys’ fees). If for any reason, the parties are not required to arbitrate a dispute, the parties agree to waive any right they may have to a jury trial.

^^^^^ 
^Withholding. The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such federal, state or local taxes required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 

^Section 409A. Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply for purposes of complying with Code Section 409A and applicable Treasury regulations (“Section 409A”): 

^^If Executive is a “specified employee,” as such term is defined in Section 409A and determined as described below in this Section 16, any payments payable as a result of Executive’s employment termination (other than death or disability) shall not be payable before the earlier of (i) the date that is six months after Executive’s employment termination, (ii) the date Executive dies, or (iii) the date that otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 409A. This Section 16 shall be applied by accumulating all payments that otherwise would have been paid within six months of Executive’s employment termination and paying such accumulated amounts at the earliest date that complies with the requirements of Section 409A. Executive shall be a “specified employee” for the twelve-month period beginning on [[Date 4: Date]] of a year if Executive is a “key employee” as defined in Code Section 416(i) (without regard to Code Section 416(i)(5)) as of [[Date 5: Date]] of the preceding year. 

^^If any provision of the Agreement is capable of being interpreted in more than one manner, to the extent feasible, the provision shall be interpreted in a manner that does not result in an excise tax under Section 409A. For example, no payments shall be triggered by a “termination” under this Agreement unless there has been a “separation from service” under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). 

^Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to and governed by Louisiana law without regard to principles of conflict of laws. 

^Non-Assignability. This Agreement shall not be assignable by Executive. Neither Executive nor any other person acting on Executive’s behalf shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the amounts, if any, payable under this Agreement, or any part thereof. Nothing herein limits to Company’s right to assign or transfer this Agreement to a successor entity. 

^Successors. The Company shall require the ultimate parent entity of any successor (whether, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform this Agreement if no such succession had taken place. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Company” shall mean the Company and the ultimate parent entity of any successor to all or substantially all of the Company’s business or assets that assumes and agrees to perform the Company’s obligations under this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.
