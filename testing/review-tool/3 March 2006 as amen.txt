^^^ \centered (b)Neither the relevant Instructing Party instructing the Security Trustee, nor the Security Trustee itself, shall take into account the sharing of proceeds under Clause 8 (*Proceeds of Enforcement of Security*) when determining the manner of enforcement of Security (and which Security to enforce) and, if it is determined to enforce any direct Security over shares of one or more members of the Group (other than shares in the Company and/or New Intermediate Holdco), the relevant Instructing Party must in good faith believe that doing so will result in more aggregate proceeds resulting from enforcement of Security (disregarding the sharing of proceeds under Clause 8 (*Proceeds of Enforcement of Security*)) than would be realised solely from enforcing direct Security over shares in the Company and/or New Intermediate Holdco alone. The requirements of this paragraph (b) are solely for the benefit of the Priority Creditors and no Obligor shall have any rights under this paragraph (b). 

^^ \centered 7.12 Standstill Payments
