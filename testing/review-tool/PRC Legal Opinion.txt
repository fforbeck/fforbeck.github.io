^On [[Date 2: Date]], six PRC Government Agencies, namely, the Ministry of Commerce (the “**MOFCOM**”), the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “**CSRC**”), and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, jointly issued the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the “**Order 10**”), which became effective on [[Date 3: Date]]. On [[Date 4: Date]], the MOFCOM promulgated the amended Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the “**Order 6**”, together with Order 10, the “**New M&A Rules**”), which became effective immediately. The New M&A Rules purport, among other things, to require offshore special purpose vehicles formed for the purpose of overseas listing of the equity interests in PRC company and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC company and/or PRC individuals to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of their securities on overseas stock exchanges. On [[Date 5: Date]], pursuant to the Order 10 and other PRC Laws, the CSRC published on its official website relevant guidance with respect to the listing and trading of PRC domestic enterprises’ securities on overseas stock exchanges (the “**Related Clarifications**”), including a list of application materials regarding the listing on overseas stock exchange by special purpose vehicles.

Based on our understanding of the current PRC Laws publicly available as of the date hereof, we believe that since (a) the establishment of MeKeFuBang as a wholly foreign owned enterprise (b) the Business Combination described in the Registration Statement was between offshore companies, and the CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule concerning whether such transactions are subject to the New M&A Rules and Related Clarifications, and (c) the CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule concerning whether offerings like the Offering contemplated by the Company and as described in the Registration Statement is subject to the New M&A Rules and Related Clarifications, the Company is not required to obtain the approval of the CSRC under the New M&A Rules in connection with this Offering.

^The statements set forth in the Registration Statement under the headings “Risk Factors”, “Corporate Structure and History”, “Dividend Policy”, and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations”, insofar as such statements constitute summaries of PRC laws and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute correct and fair summaries of the matters described therein in all material aspects.

We are licensed to practice in the PRC and the foregoing opinion is limited to the PRC Laws currently in force and publicly available on the date of this opinion and is subject to the following additional qualifications:

^^^Our opinion is limited to the PRC Laws of general application effective as of the date hereof. We have made no investigation of, and do not express or imply any views on, the laws of any country other than the PRC;
