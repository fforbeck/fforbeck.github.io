Re.: Finder’s Agreement  
Dear Mr. Ross:

^**Services**

Beginning and effective as of [[Date 1]] **Accelerize New Media Inc**. (the “**Company**”) hereby engages Sandgrain Securities, Inc. (“**Sandgrain**” or “**Finder**”) for a period of thirty days (the “**Term**”) to act as a non-exclusive finder of investors for equity (the “**Securities**”) to be offered by the Company during the Term (the “**Services**”). In connection with the foregoing, the Finder shall introduce the Company, upon its written request, to prospective investors. Company and the prospective investors will consummate one or more financing transactions (each, a “**Financing Transaction**”).

^**Compensation**

In the event the Company consummates a Financing Transaction involving equity securities issued to an investor that was introduced to the Company within the Term as a result of Finder’s efforts made during the Term, the Company shall pay Finder the following fee (the “**Finder’s Fee**”):

^^^**Cash Fee:** Within one (1) business day of the closing of a Financing Transaction (the “**Closing**”), the Company shall pay Sandgrain a fee equal to seven percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the purchase price of Securities sold (the “**Finder’s Fee**”) by wire. In the event of multiple Closings, the Finder’s fee will be paid as the money is received by the Company.

**Warrant:** Upon the Closing (or each Closing, as the case may be) of a transaction, the Company shall deliver to Sandgrain (or Sandgrain’s designated nominee) warrants (the “Warrants”), for the issuance of such number of the Securities that equals five percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the amount of the Securities sold at such Closing (or Closings). The Warrants shall be assignable by the holder to any person, including an employee of Sandgrain. The Warrants shall be exercisable for three (3) years from the date of grant with an exercise price of sixty-five cents ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]). Additionally, all securities issued hereunder to Sandgrain shall have identical demand registration rights, co-sale rights and all other rights as given to investors under the financing transaction.

**Expenses**. Upon the first Closing (regardless of the purchase price of the securities sold), the Company shall, in addition to the foregoing, pay Sandgrain a fee of up to $[[USD Value 1: Number]] for the expenses incurred in connection with this agreement.
