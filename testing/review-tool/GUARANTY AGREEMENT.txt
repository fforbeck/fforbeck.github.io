^\centered THE GUARANTY 

^Guaranty. In consideration of the Lender entering into the Loan Agreement, the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guaranty to the Lender the due and punctual payment of all of the Guaranteed Obligations, as and when the same shall become due and payable, whether on demand or at maturity, by declaration or otherwise, according to the terms thereof, and all losses, costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements incurred by reason of a default under any of said Guaranteed Obligations. In case of any failure by the Borrower punctually to pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantors unconditionally, jointly and severally agree to cause such payment to be made punctually as and when the same shall become due, whether at maturity or by declaration or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Borrower. This Guaranty is an absolute, unlimited, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual payment by the Borrower of the Guaranteed Obligations and not merely of their collectibility, and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that the Lender first collect or attempt to collect the Guaranteed Obligations or any portion thereof from the Borrower or from any other guarantor (nor, as to any Guarantor, from any other Guarantor) of any of same or resort to any security or other means of obtaining payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations that the Lender now has or may acquire after the date hereof, or upon any other contingency whatsoever. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default (as defined herein) and written notice thereof to the Guarantors, all liabilities and obligations of each Guarantor to the Lender shall, at the option of the Lender, become due and payable to the Lender without further demand or notice of any nature, all of which are expressly waived by the Guarantors. Payments by the Guarantors hereunder may be required by the Lender on any number of occasions. 

^Guarantors’ Further Agreements to Pay. The Guarantors further jointly and severally agree, as principal obligors and not as guarantors, to pay to the Lender, on demand, in funds immediately available to the Lender, all costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) incurred or expended by the Lender in connection with the enforcement of this Guaranty, together with interest on any sum now or hereafter payable by the Guarantors under this Agreement, such interest to accrue from the date of demand for any payment to the date of actual payment. Such interest will be payable at the rate set forth in Section 6.04 below. 

^Freedom to Deal with Borrower and Other Parties. The Lender shall be at liberty, without giving notice to or obtaining the assent of any Guarantor and without relieving any Guarantor of any liability hereunder, to deal with each other Guarantor, with the Borrower and with each other party who now is or after the date hereof becomes liable in any manner for any of the Guaranteed Obligations in such manner as the Lender in its sole discretion deems fit. The Lender may in its sole discretion (to the extent permitted by the Loan Agreement) do any or all of the following things, none of which shall discharge or affect any Guarantor’s liability 

hereunder: (i) extend credit, make loans and afford other financial accommodations to the Borrower at such times, in such amounts and on such terms as the Lender may approve; (ii) modify, amend, vary the terms and grant extensions or renewals of any present or future indebtedness or of all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations held by Lender or any instrument relating to or securing same; (iii) grant time, waivers and other indulgences in respect thereto; (iv) vary, exchange, release or discharge, wholly or partially, or delay or abstain from perfecting and enforcing any security or guaranty held by Lender (including, as to any Guarantor, varying, exchanging, releasing, discharging or delaying or abstaining to enforce this Guaranty with respect to any other Guarantor ) or other means of obtaining payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations that the Lender now has or acquires after the date hereof; (v) take or omit to take any of the actions referred to in the Loan Documents or other instrument evidencing, securing or relating to any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any actions under this Agreement; (vi) fail, omit or delay to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy conferred on the Lender in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document or other instrument evidencing, securing or relating to any of the Guaranteed Obligations or take or refrain from taking any other action; (vii) accept partial payments from the Borrower or any other party; (viii) as to any Guaranteed Obligations held by Lender, release or discharge, wholly or partially, any other Guarantor, any endorser or any guarantor, or accept additional collateral for the payment of any Guaranteed Obligations held by Lender; (ix) compromise or make any settlement or other arrangement with the Borrower or any other Person as to the Guaranteed Obligations held by Lender; and (x) consent to and participate in the proceeds of any assignment, trust or mortgage for the benefit of creditors as to the Guaranteed Obligations held by Lender. 

^Unenforceability of Guaranteed Obligations; Invalidity of Security or Other Guaranties. If for any reason now or hereafter the Borrower has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any of the Guaranteed Obligations undertaken or purported to be undertaken by it or on its behalf, or if any of the moneys included in the Guaranteed Obligations have become irrecoverable from the Borrower by operation of law or for any other reason, this Agreement shall nevertheless be binding on the Guarantors jointly and severally to the same extent as if the Guarantors at all times had been the joint and several principal debtors on all of the Guaranteed Obligations (and no invalidity or unenforceability as to one Guarantor shall affect the obligations of any other Guarantor hereunder). This Agreement shall be in addition to any other guaranty or other security for the Guaranteed Obligations, and it shall not be prejudiced or rendered unenforceable by the invalidity of any such other guaranty or security. The liability of each Guarantor under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until payment and performance in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, any Guarantor or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 

^Waivers by Guarantors. Each Guarantor waives: notice of acceptance hereof and reliance hereon, notice of any action taken or omitted by the Lender in reliance hereon, any requirement that the Lender be diligent or prompt in making demands hereunder, any requirement as to any presentment, demand, protest, giving notice of any default by the Borrower (except as otherwise specifically required under the Loan Agreement) or asserting any other right 

of the Lender hereunder and all demands, notices (except as aforesaid) and all suretyship defenses generally. Each Guarantor also irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all defenses which at any time may be available in respect of such Guarantor’s obligations hereunder by virtue of any statute of limitations, valuation, stay, homestead or moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect. 

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this Agreement, the liability of each Guarantor shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by: 

^^^any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any obligation of the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; 

^^^any change in the time, manner, amount or place of payment of any Guaranteed Obligation or any modification or amendment of or supplement to any Loan Document or this Agreement; 

^^^any release, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or indirect security for any obligation of the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; 

^^^any change in the legal existence, structure, record or beneficial ownership or control of the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any such Person or its assets; 

^^^the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights that any Guarantor may have at any time against the Borrower, the Lender, any Guarantor or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person, whether or not arising in connection with this Agreement; 

^^^any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the Borrower or any Guarantor for any reason under any Loan Document or under this Agreement; or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by any Person of the principal of or interest on the Note or any other amount payable under any Loan Document or under this Agreement; or 

^^^any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Borrower, any other Guarantor, the Lender, or any other Person or any other circumstances whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of any Guarantor’s obligations hereunder. 

^Subrogation. Unless and until all Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and discharged, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives enforcement of any and all rights of subrogation, contribution or similar rights that, but for this Section 2.06, such Guarantor might otherwise have in relation to the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other guarantor as a result of this Agreement. No right of subrogation, 

contribution or any similar rights will in any event be deemed to give any Guarantor any cause of action against the Lender or any of its respective officers, employees or agents for any act or omission on the part of the Lender; the Lender may, without liability, release or fail to perfect any security interest and may take or omit to take any action under any of the Loan Documents, even if same would reduce the value of any Guarantor’s subrogation or similar rights. 

^No Contest with Lender. No set-off, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any obligation, or any claim or defense of any kind or nature that any Guarantor has or may have against the Borrower, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor, or the Lender, as the case may be, shall be available hereunder to any Guarantor. No Guarantor will, in any proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code or insolvency proceedings of any nature, prove in competition with the Lender in respect of any payment hereunder or be entitled to have the benefit of any counterclaim or proof of claim or dividend or payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or the benefit of any other security for any Guaranteed Obligation that, now or hereafter, any Guarantor may hold in competition with the Lender. 

^Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable jointly and severally by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Lender. 

^Payments. All payments by any Guarantor to the Lender hereunder shall be made, without withholding, deduction or offset of any sort, in lawful currency of the United States in immediately available funds at the offices of the Lender at One Kendall Square, Building 700, [[Address 1: Address]], or such other place as the Lender may designate. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and any interest payable thereon shall be payable for such extended time at the specified rate. Any payments received after 2:00 p.m. on any day will be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day.

Each Guarantor hereby consents to process being served in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in the preceding paragraph of this Section 6.09 either (i) by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to it at its address set forth in Section 6.03 or (ii) by serving a copy thereof upon it at its address set forth in Section 6.03. Each Guarantor irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claims of error by reason of any service as contemplated herein and agrees that such service shall (x) be deemed in every respect effective service upon such Guarantor in any such suit, action or proceeding and (y) to the fullest extent permitted by law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to such Guarantor. 

^Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (without giving effect to conflict of laws principles). 

^Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person, property or circumstances shall be held to any extent to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to Persons, properties or circumstances other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

^Usury. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of each Guarantor and the Lender at all times to comply with applicable state law or applicable United States federal law (to the extent that it permits the Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a greater amount of interest than under state law) and that this Section shall control every other covenant and agreement in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. If applicable state or federal law should be at any time be judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called for under this Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received with respect to this Agreement, or if the acceleration of any Guaranteed Obligation, or any prepayment, results in any Guarantor having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by applicable law, then it is the Lender’s express intent that all excess amounts theretofore actually collected by the Lender from such Guarantor and then retained by the Lender shall be credited on the principal balance of the indebtedness guaranteed hereby, and the provisions of this Agreement shall immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new documents, so as to comply with the applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder or thereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid by any Guarantor to the Lender for the use or forbearance of the Guaranteed Obligations shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full stated term of the Guaranteed Obligations until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest collected under this Agreement does not exceed the maximum lawful rate from time to time in effect and applicable to the obligations payable under this Agreement. 

^Headings. Article and Section headings in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.
