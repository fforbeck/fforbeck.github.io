Lender shall not share in and shall have no obligation with respect to any loss suffered by the Property.

^**General Provisions**.  
^^**No Partnership or Member**. Lender, by its acceptance hereof, does not become a partner with or a member of Borrower, and in no event shall Lender be liable for any of the debts, obligations, or liabilities of Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower, or claim any of the tax benefits resulting from the ownership of the Property, including, without limitation, any depreciation or investment tax credit on all or any portion of the Property, nor is Lender liable for any contributions to Borrower.

^^**Power and Authority**. Borrower represents and warrants that: (i) Borrower is a Delaware limited liability company validly formed and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and validly qualified to transact business in the State of Texas; (ii) Borrower is duly authorized and has all necessary partnership power and authority to grant the Lender’s Profits Interest; and (iii) the execution of this Agreement does not violate or conflict with the organizational documents of Borrower or any law, rule or regulation, or any other material agreement or instrument to which any such Person is a party or by which any such Person is bound.

Profits Interest Agreement - Page 5      
^^**Security**. Borrower agrees from time-to-time to execute and deliver to Lender UCC-1 Financing Statements and other instruments reasonably requested by Lender to evidence or perfect the Lender’s Profits Interest granted to Lender hereby.

^^**Lien**. The obligations of Borrower hereunder are secured by the liens and security interests securing the Loan, as they may from time-to-time be released as provided in the Loan Agreement and as they may from time-to-time be modified, renewed, extended, or increased.

^^**Notices**. Written notice required to be given to either party shall be deemed given if sent in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement.

^^**Subject to Senior Loan**. Lender acknowledges and agrees that the payment of and performance under this Agreement is subject to and subordinate to the Senior Loan in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. If any performance under this Agreement would cause a default under the Senior Loan, then such performance will not be required under this Agreement until such time as it would not cause a default under the Senior Loan.

^**Speculative and Contingent Rights**. Borrower and Lender acknowledge that the receipt by Lender of any amounts which may be payable for the Lender’s Profits Interest is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, the possibility of unanticipated costs in the ownership, operation, and leasing of the Property (including, without limitation, those resulting from unforeseen conditions or force majeure); the possibility of utility moratoria or materials or labor costs decreasing the Cash Flow or Second Tier Profits; and the possibility of a change in interest rates or the economy in general, or the addition of or improvements to competing properties impacting the leasing, value, or sale of properties of the same type as the Property. Borrower and Lender further acknowledge that Lender’s receipt of any of the Lender’s Profits Interest is contingent on the availability of Cash Flow and Second Tier Profits. To the extent the grant of the Lender’s Profits Interest is deemed to be interest on the Loan, the value of such grant shall be determined as of the date of this Agreement, taking into account the speculative and contingent nature of the profits interest granted hereunder. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrower and Lender at all times to comply with applicable state law or applicable United States federal law (to the extent that it permits Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve, or receive a greater amount of interest than under state law) and that this Section 9 shall control every other covenant and agreement in this Agreement, the Loan Agreement, and the documents reference d therein. If the applicable law (state or federal) is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called for under this Agreement, then it is Borrower’s and Lender’s express intent that all excess amounts theretofore collected by Lender be repaid to Borrower with interest thereon at the rate set forth in the Note, and the provisions of this Agreement immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder and thereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance, and detention of the indebtedness represented by the Loan Agreement and the Note shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that 

Profits Interest Agreement - Page 6      
the rate or amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Rate from time-to-time in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan remains outstanding.

ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY BORROWER WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY JUDGMENT ENTERED BY ANY COURT IN RESPECT HEREOF, MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, COUNTY OF TRAVIS, OR IN THE UNITED STATES COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS AS LENDER IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION MAY ELECT AND BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING. BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING IN SAID COURT BY THE MAILING THEREOF BY LENDER BY REGISTERED OR CERTI FIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO BORROWER’S ADDRESS SHOWN IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF LENDER TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST BORROWER OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF ITS PROPERTY IN COURTS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTIONS WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN THE COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, COUNTY OF TRAVIS, AND HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN ANY INCONVENIENT FORUM. ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY ANY BORROWER AGAINST LENDER SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT LOCATED IN TRAVIS COUNTY, TEXAS.
