^RECOGNIZE that my employment in certain capacities with a competitor would by its nature involve the unauthorized use or disclosure of Company Confidential Information and/or unauthorized conversion of goodwill developed at the Company’s expense to the benefit of the competitor; 

^RECOGNIZE that the Company’s Confidential Information and business relationships are critical to its success in the marketplace, and that the nature of the Confidential Information and customer goodwill that I will be provided with will be national in nature as the Company operates on a nationwide-basis. I recognize and concur that the legitimate business interests of the Company in protecting its Confidential Information and/or customer goodwill is nationwide in nature; 

^RECOGNIZE that the law regarding restrictive covenants varies from state to state and the law that will apply to this Agreement after I terminate will depend on factors such as where I live, where I work, the location of my employer, the location of my former employer and other factors, many which are unknown at this time; 

THEREFORE, in consideration for the employment provided to me, to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of Company Confidential Information and/or unauthorized conversion of customer goodwill, and to protect the Company’s valuable Confidential Information and/or customer goodwill, I agree to the following: 

^**Definitions.** 

^^**Confidential Information.** For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” shall mean any information, or compilation of information, including its business, its plans, its customers, its contracts, its suppliers, or its strategies, that has been or is created, maintained, or used by the Company in the course of its business and that is not generally known to the public or to those for whom it would have value or provide an actual or potential competitive advantage. Confidential Information includes third party information provided to the Company in confidence. Authorized disclosure of Confidential Information by the Company to a third party in confidence for a limited business purposes will not remove it from protection of this Agreement for any other party or for any other purpose. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, all such information I learned or developed during any previous employment with the Company or its predecessors in interest and all of the Company’s confidential, proprietary and trade secret information, which may include information and strategies relating to the Company’s products, processes and services, including customer lists and files, product description and pricing, information and strategy regarding profits, costs, marketing, purchasing, sales, customers, suppliers, contract terms, employees, salaries, product development plans, business, acquisition and financial plans and forecasts, and marketing and sales plans and forecasts. I acknowledge that requiring me to enter into this Agreement is one of the measures that the Company uses to maintain the secrecy of its Confidential Information. 

^^**Relevant Territory.** For purposes of this Agreement, “Relevant Territory” shall mean any territory or region in which I performed services on behalf of the Company or about which I learned Confidential Information regarding the Company during the two (2) years prior to my separation from the Company for any reason. 

^^**Services.** For purposes of this Agreement, “Services” shall mean the same as or similar in purpose or function to those activities in which I engaged during the two (2) years prior to my separation from the Company for any reason. 

^**Confidentiality.** I agree that I will not, during my employment with the Company (except in furtherance of the Company’s interests), or at any time after employment terminates, without the prior written consent of the Company Vice President of Human Resources, disclose any Confidential Information to or use any Confidential Information for, any third party or entity. This restriction prohibits me from, among other activities, engaging in or preparing to engage in developing, producing, marketing, distributing or selling lawn, garden, animal health, nutrition or pet related products for any business entity if that activity in any way involves the use or disclosure of Company Confidential Information and diverting or attempting to divert any business or customers from the Company using Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Confidential Information is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be confidential information that does not qualify for protection as a trade secret under applicable law, the prohibition on use and disclosure of that specific information provided for herein shall only be in effect for a period of three years after the termination of my employment with the Company; otherwise as to trade secret information the prohibition shall last until the information ceases to be a trade secret (other than through any breach of secrecy by me or other third parties under a duty of secrecy to the Company). In the event that after my employment with the Company ceases, if I have any doubt about whether particular information may be used or disclosed, I will contact the Company Vice President of Human Resources. I agree that I will return at termination, all Company property and information in any and all forms, including electronically stored information.

^**Post-Employment Activities** 

^^**Non-Competition.** For eighteen (18) months after the termination of my employment with the Company and/or any post-employment consulting agreement with the Company, I will not render Services, either directly or indirectly, for any business engaged in or about to be engaged in developing, producing, marketing, distributing or selling lawn, garden, animal health, nutrition or pet related products in the Relevant Territory. This paragraph shall only apply in those jurisdictions where restrictions such as contained in this paragraph are enforceable. While I reside in and am subject to the laws of California, this paragraph will not apply to me except to the limited extent I may not engage in conduct that requires me to engage in the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

^^**Non-Solicitation of Customers.** For eighteen (18) months after the termination of my employment with the Company and/or any post-employment consulting agreement with the Company, I will not solicit, directly or indirectly, any customer of the Company whose identity is a Company trade secret, or any customer about whom I learned Confidential Information while in the employ or service of the Company, in lawn, garden, animal health, nutrition, or pet related products. This paragraph shall apply in those jurisdictions where restrictions such as contained in this paragraph are enforceable. 

^^**Non-Solicitation of Employees.** For eighteen (18) months after the termination of my employment with the Company and/or any post-employment consulting agreement with the Company, I will not recruit, solicit or induce, or attempt to recruit, solicit or induce, any employee of the Company to terminate their employment with the Company or otherwise cease their relationship with the Company.

^**Reformation/Severability.** If any restriction set forth in this Agreement is found by a court to be unenforceable for any reason, the court is empowered and directed to interpret the restriction to extend only so broadly as to be enforceable in that jurisdiction. Additionally, should any of the provisions of this Agreement be determined to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is agreed that such determination shall not affect the enforceability of the other provisions herein. 

^**Further Acknowledgments.** I understand that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are necessary and reasonable for the protection of the Company’s business, goodwill and its Confidential Information. I understand that any breach of this Agreement will cause the Company substantial and irrevocable damage and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies which may be available, including the return of consideration paid for this Agreement, I agree that the Company shall have the right to seek specific performance and injunctive relief. Any business entity that employs me in a capacity in which I violate this Agreement shall be liable for damages and injunctive relief. Further, I understand that the Company intends to install the full measure of protections permitted by the law to protect its Confidential Information and business relationships, but does not intend to impose any greater protections on me than those permitted by law. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LAW THAT COULD GOVERN RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS SUCH AS THIS IS IMPORTANT, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE. ABSENT MY AGREEMENT TO ALL OF THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAW THAT COULD APPLY AFTER I TERMINATE COULD DEPEND ON FACTORS SUCH AS WHERE I LIVE, WHERE I WORK, THE LOCATION OF MY EMPLOYER, THE LOCATION OF MY FORMER EMPLOYER AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE UNKNOWN AT THE TIME I ENTER THIS AGREEMENT. AS SUCH, I UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY OF MY CHOICE TO DISCUSS THIS AGREEMENT AND MY LEGAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AFTER MY TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. 

^**Separability****.** Courts should treat each numbered paragraph as a separate and severable contractual obligation intended to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and to which I intend to be bound. 

^**Non Waiver****.** I agree that the Company’s determination not to enforce this or similar agreements as to specific violations shall not operate as a waiver or release of my obligations under this Agreement. 

^**Fiduciary Duty****.** This Agreement is in addition to any fiduciary duty and obligation that may exist under statutory or common law. 

^**Choice of Forum and Laws****.** I agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the internal laws of the State of Delaware without reference to conflict of law principles. I acknowledge and agree that Delaware has a material interest in the terms, conditions, performance and enforcement of this Agreement and that the State of Delaware bears a substantial relationship to the Company and me and the transactions between us under this Agreement as the Company is a citizen of the State of Delaware, and the performance of my services under this Agreement shall not be limited to any one state, but rather shall involve services on behalf of the Company’s businesses and concerns that are headquartered in multiple states and which do business in all fifty states. I additionally acknowledge and agree that courts of the State of Delaware shall be a proper and exclusive forum to adjudicate any and all claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise arising in connection with the future relationship between the Company and me. Should the Company determine to seek judicial relief, I hereby consent to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of Delaware. I also agree exclusively to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of Delaware in the event I initiate any action involving any alleged non-compliance with this Agreement by the Company or any action involving the meaning, interpretation or enforcement of any provision of this Agreement. I hereby represent that I am a sophisticated and knowledgeable businessperson, and that I fully and freely bargained for and agreed to the selection of such forum to resolve any and all disputes and/or claims between the Company and me.

THEREFORE, in consideration for employment and the additional consideration provided herein, Executive and the Company agree to the following: 

^Consulting Services. Executive will provide continuing strategic advice and counsel related to the business issues and projects Executive was involved in while employed by the Company (“Consulting Services”). Executive will be available to provide approximately ten (10) hours of such Consulting Services per month in a manner that will not unduly interfere with any other employment Executive may then have. 

^Term of Agreement. Executive will provide Consulting Services effective upon termination of Executive’s employment with the Company and continuing thereafter for a period of twenty-four (24) months (“Term of Agreement”). Should the Executive’s employment with the Company be terminated for cause or if the Executive resigns from employment with the Company, the Company retains the right in its sole discretion to elect not to utilize the Executive in any Post-Employment Consultant capacity, in which case any rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall have no effect. Should the Company decide under this provision not to utilize the Executive in any Post-Employment Consultant capacity, the Company will give prompt written notice to the Executive of that decision.

This paragraph shall only apply in those jurisdictions where restrictions such as contained in this paragraph are enforceable. While I reside in and am subject to the laws of California, this paragraph will not apply to me except to the limited extent that I agree that I may not engage in or prepare to engage in developing, producing, marketing, distributing or selling lawn, garden, animal health, nutrition or pet related products for myself or any business entity if that activity in any way involves the unauthorized use or disclosure of Company Confidential Information and/or diverting or attempting to divert any business or customers from the Company using such Confidential Information. 

^Confidential Information or Materials. During the Term of Agreement, Executive will have access to the Company’s confidential, proprietary and trade secret information (collectively called Company Confidential Information”) For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” shall mean any information, or compilation of information, including its business, its plans, its customers, its contracts, its suppliers, or its strategies, that has been or is created, maintained, or used by the Company in the course of its business and that is not generally known to the public or to those for whom it would have value or provide an actual or potential competitive advantage.

Upon termination of this Agreement, Executive agrees to promptly return all Company Confidential Information. 

^Remedies. Executive understands and acknowledges that Company’s remedies at law for any material breach of this Agreement by Executive are inadequate and that any such breach will cause the Company substantial and irrevocable damage and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies which may be available, including the return of consideration paid for this Agreement, Executive agrees that the Company shall have the right to seek specific performance and injunctive relief. It is also expressly agreed that, in the event of such a breach, Company shall also be entitled to recover all of its costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in enforcing its rights hereunder. 

^Independent Contractor Status. For all purposes, during the Term of Agreement, Executive shall be deemed to be an independent contractor, and not an employee or agent of the Company.

To the extent any such Intellectual Property qualifies as a “work for hire” under the United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. Sec. 101); Executive agrees that the Company is the author for copyright purposes. To the extent that any Intellectual Property is not a work for hire, Executive agrees to assign, and hereby does assign its entire right, title and interest in such Intellectual Property, including the right to sue for past infringements. 

^No Authority to Bind Company. During the Term of Agreement, Executive will not have any authority to commit or bind Company to any contractual or financial obligations without the Company’s prior written consent. 

^Assignment. This is a personal services agreement and Executive may not assign this Agreement, or any interest herein, without the prior written consent of the Company. 

^Entire Agreement. Except for the parties’ prior Agreement to Protect Confidential Information, whose terms shall not be limited or affected by this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties on the subjects covered. It cannot be modified or waived except in a writing signed by both parties. 

^Agreement Enforceable to Full Extent Possible. If any restriction set forth in this Agreement is found by a court to be unenforceable for any reason, the court is empowered and directed to interpret the restriction to extend only so broadly as to be enforceable in that jurisdiction. Additionally, should any of the provisions of this Agreement be determined to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is agreed that such determination shall not affect the enforceability of the other provisions herein. 

^Non Waiver. I agree that the Company’s determination not to enforce this or similar agreements as to specific violations shall not operate as a waiver or release of my obligations under this Agreement. 

^Fiduciary Duty. This Agreement is in addition to any fiduciary duty and obligation that may exist under statutory or common law. 

^Choice of Forum and Laws. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the internal laws of the State of Delaware without reference to conflict of law principles.

Executive additionally acknowledges and agrees that courts of the State of Delaware shall be a proper and exclusive forum to adjudicate any and all claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise arising in connection with the future relationship between the parties. Should the Company determine to seek judicial relief, Executive hereby consents to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of Delaware. Executive also agrees exclusively to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of Delaware in the event she initiates any action involving alleged non-compliance with this Agreement by the Company or any action involving the meaning, interpretation or enforcement of any provision of this Agreement. Executive represents that she is a sophisticated and knowledgeable businessperson, and that she fully and freely bargained for and agreed to the selection of such forum to resolve any and all disputes and/or claims between the parties. 

The parties agree to each of the terms and conditions set forth above.
