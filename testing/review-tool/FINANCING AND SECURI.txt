^THE CREDIT FACILITIES

^The Revolving Credit Facility.

2.1.1 Revolving Credit Facility.

Subject to and upon the provisions of this Agreement, Lender establishes a revolving credit facility in favor of Borrower. The aggregate of all advances under the Revolving Credit Facility is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the “Revolving Loan”.

The maximum principal amount of Thirty Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 1]]) is the “Revolving Credit Committed Amount”.

During the Revolving Credit Commitment Period, Borrower may request advances under the Revolving Credit Facility in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided that after giving effect to Borrower’s request, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan and all Letter of Credit Obligations would not exceed the Revolving Credit Committed Amount.

Unless sooner paid, the unpaid Revolving Loan, together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other Obligations shall be due and payable in full on the Revolving Credit Expiration Date.

2.1.2 Procedure for Making Advances Under the Revolving Loan; Lender Protection Loans.

Borrower may borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility on any Business Day. Advances under the Revolving Loan shall be deposited to a demand deposit account of Borrower with Lender (or an Affiliate of Lender) or shall be otherwise applied as directed by Borrower, which direction Lender may require to be in writing. No later than 12:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the date of the requested borrowing, Borrower shall give Lender oral or written notice (a “Loan Notice”) of the amount and (if requested by Lender) the purpose of the requested borrowing. Any oral Loan Notice shall be confirmed in writing by Borrower within three (3) Business Days after the making of the requested advance under the Revolving Loan. Each Loan Notice shall be irrevocable.

In addition, Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Lender at any time and from time to time, without further request from or notice to Borrower, to make advances under the Revolving Loan, which Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of Lender, including, without limitation, advances and reserves under the Revolving Loan made to cover debit balances in the Revolving Loan Account, principal of, and/or interest on, the Revolving Loan, the Obligations (including, without limitation, any Letter of Credit Obligations), and/or Enforcement Costs, prior to, on, or after the termination of other advances under this Agreement, regardless of whether the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loan that Lender may advance or reserve hereunder exceeds the Revolving Credit Committed Amount.

2.1.3 Revolving Credit Note.

The obligation of Borrower to pay the Revolving Loan, with interest, shall be evidenced by a promissory note (as from time to time extended, amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Revolving Credit Note”) substantially in the form of EXHIBIT A attached hereto and made a part hereof, with appropriate insertions. The Revolving Credit Note shall be dated as of the Closing Date, shall be payable to the order of Lender at the times provided in the Revolving Credit Note, and shall be in the principal amount of the Revolving Credit Committed Amount. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that, if the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan outstanding from time to time exceeds the face amount of the Revolving Credit Note, the excess shall bear interest at the Post-Default Rate for the Revolving Loan and shall be payable, with accrued interest, ON DEMAND. The Revolving Credit Note shall not operate as a novation of any of the Obligations or nullify, discharge, or release any such Obligations or the continuing contractual relationship of the parties hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

2.1.4 Optional Prepayments of Revolving Loan.

Borrower shall have the option, at any time and from time to time, to prepay (each a “Revolving Loan Optional Prepayment” and collectively the “Revolving Loan Optional Prepayments”) the Revolving Loan, in whole or in part without premium or penalty.

2.1.5 Revolving Loan Account.

Lender will establish and maintain a loan account on its books (the “Revolving Loan Account”) to which Lender will (a) debit (i) the principal amount of each advance of the Revolving Loan made by Lender hereunder as of the date made, (ii) the amount of any interest accrued on the Revolving Loan as and when due, and (iii) any other amounts due and payable by Borrower to Lender from time to time under the provisions of this Agreement in connection with the Revolving Loan, including, without limitation, Enforcement Costs, Fees, late charges, and service, collection and audit fees, as and when due and payable, and (b) credit all payments made by Borrower to Lender on account of the Revolving Loan as of the date made. Lender may debit the Revolving Loan Account for the amount of any Item of Payment that is returned to Lender unpaid. All credit entries to the Revolving Loan Account are conditional and shall be readjusted as of the date made if final and indefeasible payment is not received by Lender in cash or solvent credits. Any and all periodic or other statements or reconciliations, and the information contained in those statements or reconciliations, of the Revolving Loan Account shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Borrower in all respects, absent manifest error, unless Lender receives specific written objection thereto from Borrower within thirty (30) Business Days after such statement or reconciliation shall have been sent by Lender.

2.1.6 Revolving Credit Unused Line Fee.

Borrower shall pay to Lender a quarterly revolving credit facility fee (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Unused Line Fees” and individually, a “Revolving Credit Unused Line Fee”) in an amount equal to two tenths of one percent ([[Percentage 8: Number]]%) per annum of the average daily unused and undisbursed portion of the Revolving Credit Committed Amount, minus the face amount of any outstanding Letters of Credit, in effect from time to time accruing during each calendar quarter. The accrued and unpaid portion of the Revolving Credit Unused Line Fee shall be paid by Borrower to Lender on the first day of each calendar quarter, commencing on the first such date following the date hereof, and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date.

^The Letter of Credit Facility.

2.2.1 Letters of Credit.

Subject to and upon the provisions of this Agreement, and as a part of the Revolving Credit Commitment, Borrower, upon the prior approval of Lender, may obtain standby letters of credit (as the same may from time to time be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, each a “Letter of Credit” and collectively the “Letters of Credit”) from Lender from time to time from the Closing Date until the Business Day preceding the Revolving Credit Termination Date. Borrower will not be entitled to obtain a Letter of Credit hereunder unless (a) after giving effect to the request, the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan and of the Letter of Credit Obligations would not exceed the Revolving Credit Committed Amount, (b) the sum of the aggregate face amount of the then outstanding Letters of Credit (including the face amount of the requested Letter of Credit) does not exceed Ten Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 2]]) and (c) the term of the requested Letter of Credit is not greater than three hundred sixty-five (365) days (it being understood that the Letters of Credit hereunder may contain “evergreen” automatic renewal provisions).

2.2.2 Letter of Credit Fees.

Prior to or simultaneously with the opening of each Letter of Credit, Borrower shall pay to Lender, a letter of credit fee (each a “Letter of Credit Fee” and collectively the “Letter of Credit Fees”) in an amount equal to one percent ([[Percentage 9: Number]]%) per annum of the face amount of the Letter of Credit. The Letter of Credit Fees shall be paid in advance on a quarterly basis, commencing on the opening of each Letter of Credit and on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter. In addition, Borrower shall pay to Lender all other reasonable and customary amendment, negotiation, processing, transfer or other fees to the extent and as and when required by the provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement. All Letter of Credit Fees and all such other additional fees are included in and are a part of the “Fees” payable by Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement and are a part of the Obligations.

2.2.3 Terms of Letters of Credit.

Each Letter of Credit shall (a) be opened pursuant to a Letter of Credit Agreement, and (b) expire on a date not later than the Business Day, which is 364 days after the Revolving Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, if any Letter of Credit does have an expiration date later than the Business Day preceding the Revolving Credit Termination Date (each a “Post-Expiration Date Letter of Credit” and collectively, the “Post-Expiration Date Letters of Credit”), effective as of the Business Day preceding the Revolving Credit Termination Date and without prior notice to or the consent of Borrower, Lender shall make advances under the Revolving Loan for the account of Borrower in the aggregate face amount of all such Letters of Credit. Lender shall deposit the proceeds of such advances into one or more non-interest bearing accounts with and in the name of Lender and over which Lender alone shall have exclusive power of access and withdrawal (collectively, the “Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account”). The Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account is to be held by Lender as additional collateral and security for any Letter of Credit Obligations relating to the Post-Expiration Date Letters of Credit. Borrower hereby assigns, pledges, grants and sets over to Lender a first priority security interest in, and Lien on, all of the funds on deposit in the Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account, together with any and all Proceeds and products thereof as additional collateral and security for the Letter of Credit Obligations relating to the Post-Expiration Date Letters of Credit. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Lender shall be entitled to fund any draw or draft on any Post-Expiration Date Letter of Credit from the monies on deposit in the Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account without notice to or consent of Borrower. Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that Lender’s election to fund any draw or draft on any Post-Expiration Date Letter of Credit from the Letter of Credit Cash Collateral shall in no way limit, impair, lessen, reduce, release or otherwise adversely affect Borrower’s obligation to pay any Letter of Credit Obligations under or relating to the Post-Expiration Date Letters of Credit. At such time as all Post-Expiration Date Letters of Credit have expired and all Letter of Credit Obligations relating to the Post-Expiration Date Letters of Credit have been paid in full, Lender agrees to apply the amount of any remaining funds on deposit in the Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account to the then unpaid balance of the Obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility in such order and manner as Lender shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

The aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit at any one time outstanding and issued by Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any and all Post-Expiration Date Letters of Credit, plus the amount of any unpaid Letter of Credit Fees accrued or scheduled to accrue thereon, and less the aggregate amount of all drafts issued under or purporting to have been issued under such Letters of Credit that have been paid by Lender and for which Lender has been reimbursed by Borrower in full in accordance with Section 2.2.5 (Payments of Letters of Credit) and the Letter of Credit Agreements, and for which Lender has no further obligation or commitment to restore all or any portion of the amounts drawn and reimbursed, is herein called the “Outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations”.

2.2.4 Procedures for Letters of Credit.

Such notice shall be accompanied by a duly executed Letter of Credit Agreement specifying, among other things: (a) the name and address of the intended beneficiary of the Letter of Credit, (b) the requested face amount of the Letter of Credit, (c) whether the Letter of Credit is to be revocable or irrevocable, (d) the Business Day on which the Letter of Credit is to be opened and the date on which the Letter of Credit is to expire, (e) the terms of payment of any draft or drafts which may be drawn under the Letter of Credit, (f) whether such Letter of Credit should contain “evergreen” automatic renewal provisions, and (g) any other terms or provisions Borrower desires to be contained in the Letter of Credit.

In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of a Letter of Credit Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail and control unless otherwise expressly provided in the Letter of Credit Agreement. Upon (x) receipt of such notice, (y) payment of all Letter of Credit Fees and all other Fees payable in connection with the issuance of such Letter of Credit, and (z) receipt of a duly executed Letter of Credit Agreement, Lender shall process such notice and Letter of Credit Agreement in accordance with its customary procedures and open such Letter of Credit on the Business Day specified in such notice.

2.2.5 Payments of Letters of Credit.

Borrower hereby promises to pay to Lender, ON DEMAND and in United States Dollars, the following which are herein collectively referred to as the “Current Letter of Credit Obligations”:

The obligation of Borrower to pay the Letter of Credit Obligations shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by Lender or any other Person at any time of any right or remedy against any Person which may be or become liable in respect of all or any part of such obligation or against any Collateral, security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto.

The Letter of Credit Obligations shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment of all or any portion of the Letter of Credit Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Person, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor, or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Person, or any substantial part of such Person’s property, all as though such payments had not been made.

2.3.4 Computation of Interest and Fees.

All applicable Fees and interest shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed. Any change in the interest rate on any of the Obligations resulting from a change in the BBA LIBOR Daily Floating Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change in the BBA LIBOR Daily Floating Rate is announced, as applicable.

2.3.5 Maximum Interest Rate.

In no event shall any interest rate provided for hereunder exceed the maximum rate permissible for corporate borrowers under applicable law for loans of the type provided for hereunder (the “Maximum Rate”). If, in any month, any interest rate, absent such limitation, would have exceeded the Maximum Rate, then the interest rate for that month shall be the Maximum Rate, and, if in future months, that interest rate would otherwise be less than the Maximum Rate, then that interest rate shall remain at the Maximum Rate until such time as the amount of interest paid hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been paid if the same had not been limited by the Maximum Rate. In the event that, upon payment in full of the Obligations, the total amount of interest paid or accrued under the terms of this Agreement is less than the total amount of interest which would, but for this Section, have been paid or accrued if the interest rates otherwise set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay Lender, an amount equal to the excess of (a) the lesser of (i) the amount of interest which would have been charged if the Maximum Rate had, at all times, been in effect or (ii) the amount of interest which would have accrued had the interest rates otherwise set forth in this Agreement, at all times, been in effect over (b) the amount of interest actually paid or accrued under this Agreement. In the event that a court determines that Lender has received interest and other charges hereunder in excess of the Maximum Rate, such excess shall be deemed received on account of, and shall automatically be applied to reduce, the Obligations other than interest, in the inverse order of maturity, and if there are no Obligations outstanding, Lender shall refund to Borrower such excess.

2.3.6 Payments.

All payments of the Obligations, including, without limitation, principal, interest, any Revolving Loan Optional Prepayments, and Fees, shall be paid by Borrower without setoff, recoupment or counterclaim to Lender in immediately available funds not later than 12:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the due date of such payment. All payments received by Lender after such time shall be deemed to have been received by Lender for purposes of computing interest and Fees and otherwise as of the next Business Day. Payments shall not be considered received by Lender until such payments are paid to Lender in immediately available funds to Lender’s principal office in Rockville, Maryland or at such other location as Lender may at any time and from time to time notify Borrower. Alternatively, at its sole discretion, Lender may charge any deposit account of Borrower at Lender or any Affiliate of Lender with all or any part of any amount due to Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents to the extent that Borrower shall have not otherwise tendered payment to Lender.

2.3.7 Liens; Setoff.

Borrower hereby grants to Lender as additional collateral and security for all of the Obligations, a continuing Lien on any and all monies, Investment Property, and other property of Borrower and any and all proceeds thereof, now or hereafter held or received by or in transit to, Lender, and/or any Affiliate of Lender, from or for the account of, Borrower, and also upon any and all deposit accounts (general or special) and credits of Borrower, if any, with Lender or any Affiliate of Lender, at any time existing, excluding any deposit accounts held by Borrower in its capacity as trustee for Persons who are not Affiliates of Borrower. Without implying any limitation on any other rights Lender may have under the Financing Documents or applicable Laws, during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender is hereby authorized by Borrower at any time and from time to time, without notice to, or consent of, Borrower, to set off, appropriate, seize, freeze and apply any or all items hereinabove referred to against all Obligations then outstanding (whether or not then due), all in such order and manner as shall be determined by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion.

2.3.8 Requirements of Law.

In the event that Lender shall have determined in good faith that (a) the adoption of any Capital Adequacy Regulation, or (b) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof or (c) compliance by Lender or any corporation controlling Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or Governmental Authority, does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of Lender or any corporation controlling Lender, as a consequence of the obligations of Lender hereunder to a level below that which Lender or any corporation controlling Lender would have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of Lender and the corporation controlling Lender, with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by Lender, in its discretion, to be material, then from time to time, after submission by Lender to Borrower of a written request therefor and a statement of the basis for Lender’s determination, Borrower shall pay to Lender ON DEMAND such additional amount or amounts in order to compensate Lender or its controlling corporation for any such reduction.

2.3.9 ACH Transactions and Swap Contracts.

Borrower may request and Lender or its Affiliates may, in their sole and absolute discretion, provide ACH Transactions and Swap Contracts. In the event Borrower requests Lender or its Affiliates to procure ACH Transactions or Swap Contracts, then Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold Lender or its Affiliates harmless from any and all obligations now or hereafter owing to Lender or its Affiliates. Borrower agrees to pay Lender or its Affiliates all amounts owing to Lender or its Affiliates pursuant to ACH Transactions and Swap Contracts. In the event Borrower shall not have paid to Lender or its Affiliates such amounts, Lender may cover such amounts by an advance under the Revolving Loan, which advance shall be deemed to have been requested by Borrower.

^Remedies.

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender may, in the exercise of its sole and absolute discretion from time to time, at any time thereafter exercise any one or more of the following rights, powers or remedies:

7.2.1 Acceleration.

Lender may declare any or all of the Obligations to be immediately due and payable, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents to the contrary, without presentment, demand, protest, notice of protest or of dishonor, or other notice of any kind, all of which Borrower hereby waives.

7.2.2 Further Advances.

Lender may from time to time without notice to Borrower suspend, terminate or limit any further advances, loans or other extensions of credit under the Commitments, under this Agreement and/or under any of the other Financing Documents. Further, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or Default specified in Section 7.1.6 (Receiver; Bankruptcy) or Section 7.1.7 (Involuntary Bankruptcy, etc.), the Revolving Credit Commitment and any agreement in any of the Financing Documents to provide additional credit and/or to issue Letters of Credit shall immediately and automatically terminate and the unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Note (with accrued interest thereon) and all other Obligations then outstanding, shall immediately become due and payable without further action of any kind and without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

7.2.3 Uniform Commercial Code.

Lender shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the applicable Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable Laws. Upon demand by Lender, Borrower shall assemble the Collateral and make it available to Lender, at a place designated by Lender. Lender or its agents may without notice from time to time enter upon Borrower’s premises to take possession of the Collateral, to remove it, to render it unusable, to process it or otherwise prepare it for sale, or to sell or otherwise dispose of it.

Any written notice of the sale, disposition or other intended action by Lender with respect to the Collateral which is sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, to Borrower at the address set forth in Section 8.1 (Notices), or such other address of Borrower which may from time to time be shown on Lender’s records, at least ten (10) days prior to such sale, disposition or other action, shall constitute commercially reasonable notice to Borrower. Lender may alternatively or additionally give such notice in any other commercially reasonable manner. Nothing in this Agreement shall require Lender to give any notice not required by applicable Laws.

If any consent, approval, or authorization of any state, municipal or other Governmental Authority or of any other Person or of any Person having any interest therein, should be necessary to effectuate any sale or other disposition of the Collateral, Borrower agrees to execute all such applications and other instruments, and to take all other action, as may be required in connection with securing any such consent, approval or authorization.

Borrower recognizes that Lender may be unable to effect a public sale of all or a part of the Collateral consisting of Investment Property by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and other applicable Federal and state Laws. Lender may, therefore, in its discretion, take such steps as it may deem appropriate to comply with such Laws and may, for example, at any sale of the Collateral consisting of securities restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers as to their number, nature of business and investment intention, including, without limitation, a requirement that the Persons making such purchases represent and agree to the satisfaction of Lender that they are purchasing such securities for their account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale of any thereof. Borrower covenants and agrees to do or cause to be done promptly all such acts and things as Lender may request from time to time and as may be necessary to offer and/or sell the securities or any part thereof in a manner which is valid and binding and in conformance with all applicable Laws. Upon any such sale or disposition, Lender shall have the right to deliver, assign and transfer to the purchaser thereof the Collateral consisting of securities so sold.

7.2.4 Specific Rights With Regard to Collateral.

In addition to all other rights and remedies provided hereunder or as shall exist at law or in equity from time to time, Lender may (but shall be under no obligation to), without notice to Borrower, and Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Lender as its attorney-in-fact, with power of substitution, in the name of Lender and/or in the name of Borrower or otherwise, for the use and benefit of Lender, but at the cost and expense of Borrower and without notice to Borrower:

^^^^ \centered (a) request any Account Debtor obligated on any of the Accounts to make payments thereon directly to Lender, with Lender taking control of the Proceeds thereof; 

^^^^ \centered (b) compromise, extend or renew any of the Collateral or deal with the same as it may deem advisable; 

^^^^ \centered (c) make exchanges, substitutions or surrenders of all or any part of the Collateral;

^^^^ \centered (f) demand, collect, receipt for and give renewals, extensions, discharges and releases of any of the Collateral;

^^^^ \centered (j) clear Inventory through customs in Lender’s or Borrower’s name and to sign and deliver to customs officials powers of attorney in Borrower’s name for such purpose; and 

^^^^ \centered (k) take any other action necessary or beneficial to realize upon or dispose of the Collateral or to carry out the terms of this Agreement.  
7.2.5 Application of Proceeds.

Any proceeds of sale or other disposition of the Collateral will be applied by Lender to the payment first of any and all Enforcement Costs, and any balance of such proceeds will be applied to the Obligations in such order and manner as Lender shall determine. If the sale or other disposition of the Collateral fails to fully satisfy the Obligations, Borrower shall remain liable to Lender for any deficiency.

7.2.6 Performance by Lender.

Lender without notice to or demand upon Borrower and without waiving or releasing any of the Obligations or any Default or Event of Default, may (but shall be under no obligation to) at any time thereafter make such payment or perform such act for the account and at the expense of Borrower, and may enter upon the premises of Borrower for that purpose and take all such action thereon as Lender may consider necessary or appropriate for such purpose and Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Lender as its attorney-in-fact to do so, with power of substitution, in the name of Lender, in the name of Borrower or otherwise, for the use and benefit of Lender, but at the cost and expense of Borrower and without notice to Borrower. All sums so paid or advanced by Lender together with interest thereon from the date of payment, advance or incurring until paid in full at the Post-Default Rate and all costs and expenses, shall be deemed part of the Enforcement Costs, shall be paid by Borrower to Lender on demand, and shall constitute and become a part of the Obligations.

7.2.7 Other Remedies.

Lender may from time to time proceed to protect or enforce its rights by an action or actions at law or in equity or by any other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents, or for an injunction against the violation of any of the terms of this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents, or in aid of the exercise or execution of any right, remedy or power granted in this Agreement, the Financing Documents, and/or applicable Laws. Lender is authorized to offset and apply to all or any part of the Obligations all moneys, credits and other property of any nature whatsoever of Borrower now or at any time hereafter in the possession of, in transit to or from, under the control or custody of, or on deposit with, Lender or any Affiliate of Lender.

^^^^ \centered (e) By accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable under this Agreement or under any of the other Financing Documents, Lender shall not be deemed to waive the right either to require prompt payment when due of all other amounts payable under this Agreement or under any of the other Financing Documents, or to declare a default for failure to effect such prompt payment of any such other amount.
