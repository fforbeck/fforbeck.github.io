^As respects those “Loss Occurrences” referred to in subparagraph (1) and (2) of paragraph A above, if the disaster, accident or loss occasioned by the event is of greater duration than 72 consecutive hours, then the Company may divide that disaster, accident or loss into two or more “Loss Occurrences,” provided no two periods overlap and no individual loss is included in more than one such period, and provided that no period commences earlier than the date and time of the occurrence of the first recorded individual loss sustained by the Company or a Legal Entity arising out of that disaster, accident or loss.

^This Contract applies only to such portion of any Policy that the Company, directly or indirectly, whether as insurer or reinsurer, retains net for its own respective account (prior to the deduction of any underlying reinsurance specifically permitted in this Contract). In calculating the amount of any loss hereunder and in computing the amount in excess of which this Contract attaches only loss or losses in respect of that portion of any insurance, or reinsurance which the Company, directly or indirectly, whether as insurer or reinsurer, retains net for its own account shall be included.

^It is agreed that the amount of the Reinsurers’ liability hereunder in respect of any loss shall not be increased by reason of the inability of the Company to collect from any other reinsurers, whether specific or general, any amount which may have become due from it such reinsurers whether such inability arises from the insolvency of such other reinsurer or otherwise.

^Allocation of losses and expenses to Legal Entities other than the Company pursuant to inter company reinsurance among the Legal Entities shall be entirely disregarded for all purposes of this Contract

^Any loss reimbursement the Company or a Legal Entity receives under the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF) shall apply as follows:

^Except as provided in subparagraph 2 below, any such loss reimbursement shall inure solely to the benefit of the Company and shall be entirely disregarded in applying all of the provisions of this Contract.

^If one or more loss occurrences commencing during the term of this Contract result(s) in recoveries made by the Company under this Contract and the Company or a Legal Entity under FHCF, and such recoveries, together with any other reinsurance recoveries made by the Company applicable to said loss occurrence(s), exceed the amount permitted by Florida law, any amount in excess thereof shall reduce the ultimate net loss subject to this Contract for the loss occurrence(s) to which the recoveries apply.

^For purposes hereof, if a loss reimbursement received by the Company or a Legal Entity under the FHCF is based on the Company’s or a Legal Entity’s losses in more than one loss occurrence and the FHCF does not designate the amount allocable to each loss occurrence, the reimbursement shall be prorated in the proportion that the Company’s or a Legal Entity’s losses in each loss occurrence bear to the Company’s and the Legal Entities’ total losses arising out of all loss occurrences to which the recovery applies.

^Any reimbursement premiums or emergency assessment paid by the Company or a Legal Entity under the FHCF shall be disregarded for purposes of determining subject premium and ultimate net loss under this Contract.

^It is understood and agreed that the Company may purchase underlying property per risk excess of loss covers which will inure to the benefit of this Contract.

^The Company may have in force other excess catastrophe reinsurances, recoveries under which shall inure solely to the benefit of the Company.

This Contract is worldwide in scope and shall cover risks wherever located. 

^The Company shall give notice, as soon as practicable, to Reinsurers of any claim that it has reason to believe could involve this Contract. The Company shall keep the Reinsurers informed of significant developments likely to affect the cost of any claim or claims hereunder.

^The Company or a Legal Entity may commence, continue, defend, settle, or withdraw from actions, suits, or prosecutions and, generally, do all such things relating to any claim or loss in which the Reinsurers are interested as, in the Company’s or Legal Entity’s judgment, may be beneficial or expedient to the Company or such Legal Entity, as applicable, and the Reinsurers. The Company shall be the sole judge as to what claims are covered under the Policies. All of the Ultimate Net Loss and Loss Occurrences, as well as all loss settlements made and judgments paid by the Company or a Legal Entity, provided they are within the terms of this Contract either under the strict conditions of the Policies or by way of compromise, shall be unconditionally binding upon the Reinsurers, who agree to pay all amounts for which they are liable immediately upon reasonable evidence of the amount due being furnished to the Reinsurers by the Company. The true intent of this Contract is that the Reinsurers shall, in every case to which this Contract applies, follow the settlements of the Company and the Legal Entities.

^The Reinsurers shall be credited with their share of salvage and/or subrogation in respect of claims and settlements under this Contract, less their share of recovery expense. Unless the Company and Reinsurers agree to the contrary, the Company or the Legal Entities shall enforce the right to salvage and/or subrogation and shall prosecute all claims arising out of such right. Should the Company or a Legal Entity refuse or neglect to enforce this right, the Reinsurers are hereby empowered and authorized to institute appropriate action in the name of the Company or a Legal Entity, as applicable.

^Amounts recovered from salvage and/or subrogation shall always be used to reimburse the excess Reinsurers (and the Company, should it carry a portion of excess coverage net) in the reverse order of their participation in the loss before being used in any way to reimburse the Company or a Legal Entity for its primary loss. If the amount recovered exceeds the recovery expense, the recovery expense shall be borne by each party in proportion of its benefit from the recovery. If the recovery expense exceeds the amount recovered, the amount recovered (if any) shall be applied to the reimbursement of recovery expense and the

^^^^^ 
remaining expense, as well as any originally incurred loss expense, shall be added to the Ultimate Net Loss. If no amount is recovered from salvage and/or subrogation, the expense incurred in attempting such recovery shall be deemed loss adjusted expense applicable to the specific loss for which recovery was ought and shall be added to the Ultimate Net Loss.

^All salvage and/or subrogation recoveries obtained by either party, subsequent to payments made by the Reinsurers under this Contract, shall be applied as if obtained prior to said payments and all necessary adjustments shall be made between the Company and the Reinsurers as soon as practicable after said salvage and/or subrogation recovery is obtained.

^The Company shall have the right, before the happening of the loss, to waive the right of subrogation as to that loss.

^The interest amounts provided for in this Article shall apply to the Subscribing Reinsurer or to the Company in the following circumstances:

^If a loss payment owed by the Subscribing Reinsurer to the Company is not received within 45 calendar days following the date of presentation to the Reinsurers of information necessary to approve payment of the claim, and/or

^If any premium payment owed by the Company to the Subscribing Reinsurer is not received within 45 calendar days following the date on which payment is due, and/or

^If any premium adjustment, agreed by either party to the other, is not received within 150 calendar days following the expiry or anniversary of this Contract, and/or

^If any return of premiums, commissions, profit sharing, or any amounts not provided in subparagraphs 1, 2, and 3 above, are not received in accordance with the date specified in this Contract or if no date is specified, within 90 calendar days following the date the debtor party received the billing.

^Failure by the Subscribing Reinsurer or Company to comply with their respective payment obligations within the time periods as herein provided shall, as of that date, be subject to an interest payment computed by multiplying the amount due by a variable rate consisting of the U.S. Prime Rate as published in the Eastern Edition of *The Wall Street Journal* on the first day of the calendar month in which the amount became past due, plus [[Percentage 12: Number]]%. The variable rate shall be adjusted monthly thereafter to equal the U.S. Prime Rate as published in the Eastern Edition of *The Wall Street Journal* on the first day of each successive month during which the amount due remains unpaid, plus [[Percentage 12]]%. The product shall then be multiplied by 1/365 for each day after the due date that the amount due and the interest amount remain unpaid. Any interest that occurs pursuant to this Article shall be calculated by the party to which it is owed.

^The validity of any claim or payment may be contested under the provisions of this Contract. If the debtor party prevails in an arbitration or any other proceeding with respect to the amounts in dispute, there shall be no interest penalty due. If the creditor party wholly or partially prevails on any of the amounts in dispute, the interest penalty shall be awarded as outlined above. Such interest penalty shall be calculated from the date the monies were due

and owing to the date of resolution of the arbitration or proceeding, and shall be payable as of the date of resolution of the arbitration or proceeding.

^If a Subscribing Reinsurer advances the entire or partial payment of any claim it is contesting, and wholly or partially prevails in the contest, the Company shall promptly return the applicable amount of such payment. The arbitrator(s) hearing such dispute shall determine if interest shall be added to the amount returned by the Company.

^Any interest owing pursuant to this Article may be waived by the party to which it is owed. Further, any interest calculated pursuant to this Article that is $[[USD Value 12: Number]] or less shall be waived. Any waiver of any interest pursuant to this paragraph, however, shall not affect the waiving party’s right to claim and/or pursue interest for any other failure by the other party to make payment when due under this Article.

(Applies only to a Subscribing Reinsurer who does not qualify for full credit with any insurance regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company’s reserves.) 

^As regards Polices coming within the scope of this Contract, the Company agrees that when it shall file with the insurance regulatory authority or set up on its books reserves for unearned premium and losses covered hereunder which it shall be required by law to set up, it will forward to the Subscribing Reinsurer a statement showing the proportion of such reserves which is applicable to the Subscribing Reinsurer. The Subscribing Reinsurer hereby agrees to fund such reserves in respect of unearned premium, known outstanding losses that have been reported to the Subscribing Reinsurer and allocated loss adjustment expense relating thereto, losses and loss adjustment expense paid by the Company but not recovered from the Subscribing Reinsurer, plus reserves for losses incurred but not reported as determined by the Company, as shown in the statement prepared by the Company (hereinafter referred to as “ Subscribing Reinsurer Obligations”) by Letters of Credit, unless the method of funding is determined by applicable law, statute, or regulation.

^As regards Subscribing Reinsurers authorized in any province or jurisdiction of Canada, such funding shall be equal to [[Percentage 13: Number]]% of their proportion of reserves by Letters of Credit for no more than [[Percentage 14: Number]]% of the total funding required and cash advances for the remaining.

^The Subscribing Reinsurer agrees to apply for and secure timely delivery to the Company of clean, irrevocable, and unconditional Letters of Credit issued by a bank that is a qualified U.S. financial institution and containing provisions acceptable to the insurance regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Company’s reserves in an amount equal to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s proportion of said reserves. At the Company’s request, Subscribing Reinsurer will agree to provide separate Letters of Credit for any Legal Entity listed covered under this Contract. Such Letters of Credit shall be issued for a period of not less than one year, and shall be automatically extended for one year from its date of expiration or any future expiration date unless 60 days prior to any expiration date the issuing bank shall notify the Company by certified mail that the issuing bank elects not to consider the Letters of Credit extended for any additional period.

^The Subscribing Reinsurer and Company agree that the Letters of Credit provided by the Subscribing Reinsurer pursuant to the provisions of this Contract may be drawn upon at any

time, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, and be utilized by the Company or any successor, by operation of law, of the Company, including without limitation, any liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver, or conservator of the Company, without diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or the Subscribing Reinsurer for one or more of the following purposes: 

^To pay or reimburse the Company for:

^^The Subscribing Reinsurer’s share under this Contract of premiums returned, but not yet recovered from the Subscribing Reinsurer, to the owners of Policies reinsured under this Contract on account of cancellations of such Policies; and

^^The Subscribing Reinsurer’s share, under this Contract, of surrenders and benefits or losses paid by the Company or a Legal Entity, but not yet recovered from the Subscribing Reinsurer, under the terms and provisions of the Policies reinsured under this Contract; and

^^Any other amounts necessary to secure the credit or reduction from liability for reinsurance taken by the Company.

^Where the Letters of Credit will expire without renewal or be reduced or replaced by Letters of Credit for a reduced amount and where the Subscribing Reinsurer’s entire obligations under this Contract remain unliquidated and undischarged 10 days prior to the termination date, to withdraw amounts equal to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s share of the liabilities, to the extent that the liabilities have not yet been funded by the Subscribing Reinsurer and exceed the amount of any reduced or replacement Letters of Credit, and deposit those amounts in a separate account in the name of the Company in a qualified U.S. financial institution apart from its general assets, in trust for such uses and purposes specified in above as may remain after withdrawal and for any period after the termination date.

Whenever a reference to a monetary currency appears in this Contract, it shall be construed to mean United States Dollars (“USD”). All amounts paid or received by the Company in any other currency shall be converted into United States Dollars at the rate of exchange on the date at which it is entered on the books of the Company. 

^Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the Subscribing Reinsurer, or its duly authorized representative, may upon reasonable prior written notice to the Company, at the Subscribing Reinsurer’s own expense, examine at the offices of the Company or its affiliates, during normal office hours, the Company’s or the Legal Entities’ policy, accounting, underwriting, or claim records and files, or any such additional relevant records and files, as they exist in the Company’s or its affiliates’ possession or reasonable control, relating to business ceded under this Contract. The Subscribing Reinsurer’s notice shall reasonably describe the nature of the inspection that it wishes to conduct, the persons conducting the inspection and upon notice of available files from the Company, the files that it wishes to review. Subject to the limitations expressed in this Article, this right of inspection shall survive termination or

^^^^^ 
expiration of this Contract and shall continue as long as either party has any rights or obligations under this Contract.

^The Company reserves the right to deny the Subscribing Reinsurer access to records or files concerning any particular claim(s) if the Subscribing Reinsurer has not disputed liability for payment of such claim(s), and payment of such claim(s) is more than 90 days overdue according to the Company’s records. The Company shall, however, prior to an arbitration demand that may be instituted by either party, continue to respond to reasonable specific requests for information and questions raised by the Subscribing Reinsurer concerning such claims; and nothing in this Article shall restrict the right or ability of the Subscribing Reinsurer to seek discovery of relevant information in an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the Arbitration Article of this Contract.

^As a condition precedent to access to records under this Article, the Subscribing Reinsurer, its personnel and any authorized third party representative of the Subscribing Reinsurer shall agree to the provisions of the Confidentiality Article of this Contract.

^The Company reserves the right to withhold any documents from the Subscribing Reinsurer (a) concerning Trade Secrets of the Company or its affiliates, (b) subject to the terms of a third party non-disclosure agreement with the Company or its affiliates requiring third party consent to disclosure, (c) subject to the Work Product Privilege or Attorney-Client Privilege or (d) concerning individual private information that as a matter of law cannot be disclosed by the Company or its affiliates (hereinafter referred to in the Contract as “Privileged Documents”). The Company shall reasonably try to exempt the Reinsurers from any third party non-disclosure agreement or obtain consent from the third party to disclose to the Subscribing Reinsurer.

^Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall permit and not object to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s access to Privileged Documents in connection with the underlying claim reinsured hereunder following final settlement or final adjudication of the case or cases involving such claim, with prejudice against all claimants, and all parties to such adjudications; provided that the Company, may defer release of such Privileged Documents if there are subrogation, contribution, or other third party actions with respect to that claim or case, which might jeopardize the Company’s or its affiliates’ defense by release of such Privileged Documents. In the event that the Company shall seek to defer release of such Privileged Documents, it will in consultation with the Subscribing Reinsurer take other steps as reasonably necessary to provide the Subscribing Reinsurer with the information it reasonably requires to indemnify the Company without causing a loss of such privileges. The Subscribing Reinsurer, however, shall not have access to Privileged Documents relating to any dispute between the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer.

^For purposes of this Article, “Trade Secrets” shall have the meaning provided in Section 1839 of the United States Economic Espionage Act of 1996. “Attorney-Client Privilege” shall mean communications of a confidential nature between (a) the Company or its affiliates, or anyone retained or in the control of the Company or its affiliates, or their in-house or outside legal counsel, or anyone in the control of such legal counsel, and (b) any in-house or outside legal counsel which relate to legal advice being sought by the Company or its affiliates and/or which contains legal advice being provided to the Company or its affiliates. “Work Product Privilege” shall mean communications, written materials and tangible things prepared by or for in-house or outside counsel, or prepared by or for the Company or its affiliates, in anticipation of or in connection with litigation, arbitration, or other dispute resolution proceedings.

Any inadvertent delay, omission, or error in complying with the terms and conditions of this Contract shall not be held to relieve either party hereto from any liability, which would attach to it hereunder if such delay, omission, or error had not been made, provided such delay, omission, or error is rectified upon discovery. 

The Contract may at any time be altered by mutual consent of the parties by addendum or by correspondence, either of which to be authorized and signed by a responsible official of the parties and such addendum or correspondence shall be binding on the parties and be deemed to be an integral part of this Contract. 

^Disputes to be Arbitrated. Any and all disputes between the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer arising out of, relating to, or concerning this Contract, whether sounding in contract or tort and whether arising during or after this Contract’s formation, or after its termination, including disputes as to whether the Contract was validly formed or is voidable, shall be submitted to the decision of an arbitration panel (“Panel”). The Panel shall consist of an umpire and two party-appointed arbitrators unless a party meets the requirements of paragraph C of this Article and demands arbitration pursuant thereto, in which case the Panel would consist of an umpire only.

^Procedures. Except as provided herein, any arbitration shall be based upon the Procedures for the resolution of U.S. Insurance and Reinsurance Disputes, Regular Panel Version, dated [[Date 13: Date]] (the “Procedures”), developed by the Insurance and Reinsurance Dispute Resolution Task Force, subject to the following modifications:

^Qualifications of the arbitrators and umpires shall be in accordance with Alternative section 6.2 of the Procedures.

^The Parties hereby designate the umpire list maintained by ARIAS (U.S.) as the list to be used in the event that section 6.7(a) of the Procedures is invoked.

^Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the members of the Panel shall be impartial and disinterested. The members of the Panel may not be:

^^In the control of any party or its parent, affiliate or agent;

^^A former director or officer of any party or its parent, affiliate or agent; or

^^A likely witness in the arbitration.

The requirement of impartiality means that all members of the Panel shall have the same obligation to approach the Panel’s duties and decisions with fairness and without consideration for the fact that Panel members may have been appointed by one of the 

Agency Markets Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Treaty

Effective [[Date 1]] 

Page 16. 

^^^^^ 
parties. The requirement of impartiality does not mean that the three arbitrators have no previous knowledge of or experience with respect to issues involved in the dispute or disputes.

^The first sentence of section 10.4 of the Procedures shall be replaced by the following sentence: “The Panel shall require that each Party submit concise written statements of position, including summaries of the facts and evidence a Party intends to present, discussion of the applicable law and the basis for the requested Award or denial of relief sought.”

^Once the Panel has been constituted, no party (or anyone acting for a party) shall have any communications concerning the arbitration or any of the issues before the Panel with any member of the Panel that is not also disclosed to all other parties and all members of the Panel. Each Panel member shall have a continuing duty to disclose promptly to all parties and all Panel members any violation of this prohibition and the specifics of any improper communications that occurred. This prohibition shall remain in place until all challenges to any arbitration awards and decisions have been either waived or finally concluded.

^Section 11.1 of the Procedures shall be replaced by the following provision: “The Parties may propound discovery seeking disclosure of such information and/or documents relevant to the dispute or necessary for the proper resolution of the dispute.”

^Position Statements may be amended at any reasonable time, but not later than the close of discovery without a showing to the Panel that the amending Party could not reasonably have raised the new claim or issue at an earlier time.

^The Panel shall hold an evidentiary hearing, if one is necessary, within one year of the arbitration demand, unless the Parties otherwise agree. Should a Party seek a reasonable extension to this time frame for good cause shown, the other Party’s agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld.

^To the extent permitted by the law, the Panel shall have the authority to issue subpoenas and other orders to enforce its decisions.

^The Panel may award reasonable attorneys’ fees and arbitration costs to the prevailing party, as determined by the Panel.

^Section 14.3 of the Procedures shall be replaced by the following provision: “The Panel shall make a decision and issue an award with regard to the terms expressed in this Contract, and the custom and practice of the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance business. The Panel shall not be obligated to follow the strict rules of law and evidence.”

^Alternative Streamlined Procedures. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, the Alternative Streamlined Procedures set forth in section 16 of the Procedures, as modified by sections B(3), B(4), and B(9) through B(11) of this Article, shall apply in the event that, in a consolidated proceeding or otherwise, the party initiating arbitration is seeking payment of a total amount that is no greater than $[[USD Value 10: Number]] or the currency equivalent thereof. Sections 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and the second sentence of section 16.4 of the Alternative Streamlined Procedures shall not apply. The Parties agree to comply with section 6.7 of the Procedures

^^^^^ 
to appoint a single umpire, and hereby designate the umpire list maintained by ARIAS (U.S.) as the list to be used in section 6.7(a).

^Hearing Location. The hearing shall be held in Boston, Massachusetts, unless the parties mutually agree to a different location.

^Confirmation. Either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order confirming any award of the Panel; a judgment of that Court shall thereupon be entered on any award. If such an order is issued, the party against whom confirmation is sought shall pay the attorneys’ fees incurred of the party who applied for the confirmation order and all court costs of any such proceeding.

^Equitable Relief from a Court of Law. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent any participating party from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction to issue a restraining order or other equitable relief to maintain the “status quo” of the parties participating in the arbitration pending the decision and award by the Panel.

^Consolidated Proceedings.

^*Same contract, single Reinsurer.* Both the Company and any single Reinsurer on this Contract have the right to combine any and all disputes between them that concern this Contract (including any renewal of this Contract or any contract for which this Contract is a renewal) into a single arbitration proceeding before a single Panel, except that the standard for determining whether a party may add a new issue, claim or dispute to an arbitration proceeding shall be the standard for amending a Position Statement, as set forth in subparagraph B(7) of this Article.

^*Multiple contracts, single Reinsurer.* The Company has the right to combine any and all disputes between the Company and a single Reinsurer into a single arbitration proceeding before a single Panel where such disputes involve this Contract and any additional contracts between the two parties, except that the standard for determining whether a party may add a new issue, claim or dispute to an arbitration proceeding shall be the standard for amending a Position Statement, as set forth in subparagraph B(7) of this Article.

^*Same contract, multiple reinsurers.* At the Company’s option, if more than one reinsurer is involved in arbitration relating to this Contract, where there are common questions of law or fact and a possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, all such reinsurers shall constitute and act as one party for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of the reinsurers constituting the one party; provided, however, that the reinsurers shall have the right to assert several, rather than joint defenses or claims, and to be represented by separate counsel. This provision shall not change the liability of each of the reinsurers under the terms of this Contract as several to joint.

^Choice of Law. The law set forth in the Governing Law Article shall apply to this Article. In addition, to the extent the Panel (or the umpire in an Alternative Streamlined Procedure) looks to applicable law, such Panel or umpire shall apply the law as set forth in the Governing Law Article of this Contract.

^Survival of Article. This Article shall survive the termination or expiration of this Contract.

(If more than one reinsured company is referenced within the definition of “Company” in the Preamble to this Contract, this Article shall apply severally to each such company. Further, this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state shall apply in the event of the insolvency of any company intended to be covered hereunder. In the event of a conflict between any provision of this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state of any company intended to be covered hereunder, that domiciliary state’s laws shall prevail.) 

^In the event of the insolvency of the Company, reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable on demand, with reasonable provision for verification, on the basis of claims allowed against the insolvent Company by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor of the Company having authority to allow such claims, without diminution because of such insolvency or because such liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor has failed to pay all or a portion of any claims. Such payments by the Reinsurers shall be made directly to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor, except to the extent Section 4118(a) of the New York Insurance Law applies, or except (a) where the Contract specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company, or (b) where the Reinsurers with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such Policy obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurers to the payees under such Policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees.

^It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor of the insolvent Company shall give written notice to the Reinsurers of the pendency of a claim against the insolvent Company on the policy or policies reinsured within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the insolvency proceeding and that during the pendency of such claim the Reinsurers may investigate such claim and interpose, at their own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses which it may deem available to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurers shall be chargeable, subject to court approval, against the insolvent Company as part of the expense of liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit, which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurers.

^Where two or more Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elects to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by the insolvent Company.

In consideration of the terms of this Contract, the Company shall not claim any deduction in respect of any amount paid as dividends or as reinsurance premium when making tax returns, other than income or profits tax returns to any State or to the District of Columbia or Canada. 

^This Article is applicable to those Reinsurers who are domiciled outside of the United States of America, except those Reinsurers exempt from Federal Excise Tax. Reinsurers that claim exempt status from Federal Excise Tax shall provide to the Company, upon its request, proof

^^^^^ 
that the exempt status adequately satisfies the demands of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury, or its successor and/or other applicable U.S. government authority.

^The Reinsurers shall allow the applicable percentage of the premium payable hereon (as imposed under Section 4371 of the Internal Revenue Code) for the purpose of paying Federal Excise Tax to the extent such premium is subject to such tax.

^In the event of any return of premium, the Reinsurers shall deduct the aforesaid percentage from the return premium payable hereon and the Company or its agent shall recover such tax from the United States Government.

(This article applies to unauthorized Reinsurers and to Reinsurers who are domiciled outside the United States of America.) 

^This Service of Suit Article will not be read to conflict with or override the obligations of the parties to arbitrate their disputes as provided for in the Arbitration Article. This Article is intended as an aid to compelling arbitration or enforcing such arbitration or arbitral award, not as an alternative to the Arbitration Article for resolving disputes arising out of this Contract.

^In the event of the failure of the Reinsurers to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, the Reinsurers, at the request of the Company, will submit to the jurisdiction of a Court of competent jurisdiction within the United States. Nothing in this Article constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of the Reinsurers’ rights to commence an action in any Court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another Court as permitted by the laws of the United States or of any state in the United States. The Reinsurers, once the appropriate Court is selected, whether such court is the one originally chosen by the Company and accepted by Reinsurers or is determined by removal, transfer, or otherwise, as provided for above, will comply with all requirements necessary to give said Court jurisdiction and, in any suit instituted against any of them upon this Contract, will abide by the final decision of such Court or of any Appellate Court in the event of an appeal.

^Service of process in such suit may be made upon Mendes & Mount, LLP, [[Address 1: Address]].

^The above-named are authorized and directed to accept service of process on behalf of Reinsurers in any such suit. Further, pursuant to any statute of any state, territory, or district of the United States that makes provision therefore, the Reinsurers hereby designate the Superintendent, Commissioner, or Director of Insurance, or other officer specified for that purpose in the statute, or their successor(s) in office, as their true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit, or proceedings instituted by or on behalf of the Company or any beneficiary hereunder arising out of this Contract, and hereby designate the above-named as the person to whom the said officer is authorized to mail such process or a true copy thereof.

Each party to this Contract together with their successors or assigns shall have and may exercise, at any time, the right to offset any balance(s) due the other (or, if more than one, any other). Such offset may include balances due under this Contract, and any other contracts between the parties, whether such balances arises from premium, losses, or otherwise, and regardless of the capacity of any party, whether as assuming and/or ceding insurer, under the various reinsurance contracts involved, provided however, that in the event of insolvency of a party hereto, offsets shall only be allowed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law, statute, or regulation governing such offset. 

The validity and interpretation of this Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 

^Confidential Information. The submission materials, and any Policy, financial, underwriting, accounting, and claims information, data statements, representations, and other materials provided by the Company and received by the Subscribing Reinsurer in the course of an audit, inspection, or otherwise, represent confidential or proprietary information (“Confidential Information”). This Confidential Information is intended for the sole use of the Subscribing Reinsurer (and its retrocessionaires, respective auditors, accountants, and legal counsel) as may be necessary in analyzing and/or accepting a participation in and/or executing its responsibilities under or related to this Contract. Subscribing Reinsurer acknowledges and agrees that with respect to any review of Confidential Information by Subscribing Reinsurer, and/or discussion of Confidential Information, Company does not waive and does not intend to waive any available privilege or protection. The review of Confidential Information by Subscribing Reinsurer and/or discussion of Confidential Information with Company shall not destroy, waive, or otherwise impair the proprietary and/or protected status of any Confidential Information or any information revealed in such discussion with Company personnel, whether reviewed by and/or discussed with Subscribing Reinsurer intentionally or inadvertently, nor does the review of the Confidential Information and/or discussion of Confidential Information with Company constitute an estoppel or waiver of Company’s rights to assert the attorney-client or work-product privileges, or any other applicable privilege or protection, over certain documents contained in the Company files and/or certain information.

^The Company and Subscribing Reinsurer agree that no confidentiality obligations will apply to Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information: (1) is or becomes available to the public, other than as a result of impermissible disclosure by the Subscribing Reinsurer, (2) was or became available lawfully to Subscribing Reinsurer from a source, other than Company, its affiliates or their personnel, that is not subject to a confidentiality obligation, (3) was developed independently by Subscribing Reinsurer prior to disclosure by Company, its affiliates or their personnel, as demonstrated by Subscribing Reinsurer’s records, or (4) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, court, or regulatory agency action.

through its review of Confidential Information or discussions with the Company’s or its affiliates’ personnel. Subscribing Reinsurer further agrees not to disclose any such Confidential Information to any other person or entity except as such disclosure may be necessary to its retrocessionaires, accountants, attorneys, auditors, actuaries or third party cat modelers or as otherwise required by law. Subscribing Reinsurer agrees that no Confidential Information is to be copied and/or removed from Company’s premises without the express permission of Company.

^Third-Party Demand. Should Subscribing Reinsurer receive a third-party demand pursuant to subpoena, summons, or court or governmental order, to disclose Confidential Information (including Non-public personally identifiable information) that has been provided by the Company, the Subscribing Reinsurer shall make commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Company promptly upon receipt of the demand and prior to disclosure of the Confidential Information and provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to object to the disclosure. If the Company timely objects to the release of the Confidential Information, the Subscribing Reinsurer will comply with the reasonable requests of the Company in connection with the Company’s efforts to resist release of the Confidential Information. The Company shall bear the cost of resisting the release of the Confidential Information.

^Survival. The parties agree that the obligations contained in this Article shall survive the expiration or termination of this Contract.

If any provision of this Contract shall be rendered illegal or unenforceable by the laws, regulations or public policy of any state, such provision shall be considered void in such state, but this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Contract or the enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. 

^The Company may terminate this Contract at any time by the giving of 30 days prior notice in writing to the Subscribing Reinsurer upon the happening of any one of the following circumstances:

^A State Insurance Department or other legal authority orders the Subscribing Reinsurer to cease writing business; or

^The Subscribing Reinsurer has become insolvent or has been placed into liquidation or receivership (whether voluntary or involuntary) or there have been instituted against it proceedings for the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, rehabilitator, conservator, trustee in bankruptcy, or other agent known by whatever name, to take possession of its assets or control of its operations; or

^The Subscribing Reinsurer’s policyholders’ surplus has been reduced by [[Percentage 15: Number]]% of the amount of surplus at the inception of this Contract; or

^The Subscribing Reinsurer has become merged with, acquired or controlled by any company, corporation, or individual(s) not controlling the Reinsurer’s operations at the inception of this Contract; or

^The Subscribing Reinsurer’s A.M. Best Rating has been assigned or downgraded below A- or Standard & Poor’s Rating has been assigned or downgraded below A-.

^The coverage afforded by this Contract shall cease as of the date of termination and the Subscribing Reinsurer shall return the unearned premium, if any. If coverage hereunder terminates while a claim covered by this Contract is in progress, the Subscribing Reinsurer shall be liable subject to all other conditions hereof for its proportion of the entire claim, provided that the event giving rise to the claim started before such termination.

^If the Company elects to terminate this Contract, the Company shall have the option to commute the Subscribing Reinsurer’s liability for loss(es), whether reported or unreported, comprising the sum total of the present value of the ceded (1) case reserves and allocated loss adjustment expense, (2) projected ultimate losses, (3) any unearned premium reserve, and (4) undiscounted outstanding paid claims (hereinafter the “Commutation Losses”), on policies covered by this Contract as of the effective date of termination.

^The Company shall submit a statement of valuation showing the elements considered reasonable to establish the Commutation Losses, and the Subscribing Reinsurer shall pay the amount requested. In the event the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer cannot agree on the statement of valuation of the Subscribing Reinsurer’s liability under such policies, either party may request in writing that the differences be settled by a panel of three actuaries. Each party shall appoint an actuary to assess such liability within 15 days after receipt of the written request for commutation. Upon such appointment, the two actuaries shall appoint a third actuary. If the two actuaries fail to agree on the third actuary within 30 days of their appointment, each of them shall nominate three individuals, of whom the other shall decline two, and the final decision shall be made by drawing lots. The actuaries shall then investigate and capitalize such Commutation Loss(es) within 30 days. As used herein, “capitalize” shall mean to determine the present value of Commutation Losses, without regard to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s ability to pay such losses. The panel shall meet in Boston, Massachusetts, unless the Company and Subscribing Reinsurer agree otherwise.

^All actuaries shall be disinterested in the outcome of the commutation and shall be Fellows of the Society of Actuaries/Fellows of the Casualty Actuarial Society. Except as stated below, the expense of the actuaries and of the commutation shall be equally divided between the parties of the commutation.

^The decision in writing of the actuaries, when filed with the parties hereto, shall be final and binding, except that if the Company does not agree with the capitalized value of the Commutation Loss(es), the Company shall have no obligation to commute.

^^^^^ 
\centered **TERRORISM EXCLUSION CLAUSE** 

This Contract does not apply to and specifically excludes terrorism-related losses as follows: 

^For risks located in the United States of America, its territories and possessions, and at the premises of any United States mission as such terms are intended to apply under the terms of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as it may be amended from time-to-time:

^“Insured Losses” resulting, directly or indirectly, from a “Certified Act of Terrorism” under the terms of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 as it may be amended from time-to-time.

^Loss or damage, directly or indirectly, arising out of or in connection with nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological explosion, pollution, or contamination resulting from any Other Act of Terrorism. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Contract shall extend to cover insured physical loss or damage, excluding all time-element coverages and extensions, incurred as a direct and immediate consequence of an Other Act of Terrorism employing any non-nuclear weapon or device designed to disperse chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants; but, no coverage shall be afforded for any ensuing chemical, biological, or radiological contamination or pollution resulting from an Other Act of Terrorism employing such weapon or device.

“Other Act of Terrorism” as used in this subparagraph A.2. above shall mean any violent act or act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure that results in physical loss or damage that is committed by an individual or individuals acting on behalf of any person or interest as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States government by coercion, which is not a “Certified Act of Terrorism” under the terms of TRIA.

^For risks located within the United Kingdom, this Contract shall not cover:

^Loss, destruction, or damage in Great Britain (being England, Wales, and Scotland) occasioned by or happening through or as a direct or indirect consequence of an Act of Terrorism.

^Loss, destruction, or damage in Northern Ireland within the meaning of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 or successors thereof.

In the event of an occurrence giving rise to a loss or losses payable by the Company or a Legal Entity not being certified by Her Majesty’s government or Her Majesty’s Treasury or any successor relevant Authority to have been an Act of Terrorism and solely by reason thereof the Company or a Legal Entity is unable to recover such loss or losses in whole or in part from Pool Reinsurance Company Limited, the Reinsurers accept that this subparagraph B.1. above does not apply to such loss or losses.

For the purpose of this paragraph B:

^^^^^ 
“Act of Terrorism” means an act of persons acting on behalf of or in connection with any organization that carries out activities directed towards the overthrowing or influencing by force or violence of Her Majesty’s government in the United Kingdom.

This paragraph B shall not, however, apply to goods in transit or goods in temporary storage while in transit.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph B excludes loss or damage directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological explosion, pollution, or contamination resulting from any Act of Terrorism. This Contract shall extend, however, to cover insured physical loss or damage, excluding all time-element coverages and extensions, incurred as a direct and immediate consequence of an Act of Terrorism employing any non-nuclear weapon or device designed to disperse chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants; but, no coverage shall be afforded for any ensuing chemical, biological, or radiological contamination or pollution resulting from an Act of Terrorism employing such weapon or device.

^For risks located in all other sovereignties not subject to paragraphs A or B above:

Loss or damage, directly or indirectly, caused by, contributed to by, resulting from, or arising out of or in connection with any Act of Terrorism, as defined in this paragraph C, regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any other sequence to the loss.

For the purpose of this paragraph C:

“Act of Terrorism” shall mean any violent act or act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure that results in physical loss or damage that is committed by an individual or individuals acting on behalf of any person or interest as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of any nation or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the government of any such sovereign nation by coercion.

Where an occurrence falling within the definition of Act of Terrorism in this paragraph C, involving risks insured or reinsured in Consorcio, Gareat, Extremus, the Australian Terrorism Pool (or any similar scheme formed during the term of this Contract) gives rise to a loss or losses payable by the Company and such occurrence is not certified by the individual authority acting respectively for Consorcio, Gareat, Extremus, the Australian Terrorism Pool (or any similar scheme formed during the term of this Contract) having responsibility to make such judgment, or any successor authority, as an Act of Terrorism, the Reinsurers accept that this exclusion does not apply to such loss(es).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph C excludes loss or damage, directly or indirectly, arising out of or in connection with nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological explosion, pollution, or contamination resulting from any Act of Terrorism. This Contract shall extend, however, to cover insured physical loss or damage, excluding all time-element coverages and extensions, incurred as a direct and immediate consequence of an Act of Terrorism employing any non-nuclear weapon or device designed to disperse chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants; but, no coverage shall be afforded for any ensuing chemical, biological, or radiological contamination or pollution resulting from an Act of Terrorism employing such weapon or device.

**(APPLICABLE TO LOSSES OCCURRING AFTER 31 [[Date 21: Date]] FOR RISKS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ITS TERRITORIES AND POSSESSIONS, AND AT THE PREMISES OF ANY UNITED STATES MISSION.)** 

^In the event that the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (“TRIA”) is extended, renewed, or succeeded without interruption beyond 31 [[Date 21]], and without revision or adaptation beyond 31 [[Date 21]] to the definitions set forth in subsections 102 (1)(A), (14), and (15) of TRIA, this Contract shall not cover:

^“Insured Losses” resulting directly or indirectly from a “Certified Act of Terrorism” under the terms of TRIA, as it may be amended from time-to-time.

^Loss or damage, directly or indirectly, arising out of or in connection with nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological explosion, pollution, or contamination resulting from any Other Act of Terrorism. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Contract shall extend to cover insured physical loss or damage, excluding all time-element coverages and extensions, incurred as a direct and immediate consequence of an Other Act of Terrorism employing any non-nuclear weapon or device designed to disperse chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants; however, no coverage shall be afforded for any ensuing chemical, biological, or radiological contamination or pollution resulting from an Other Act of Terrorism employing such weapon or device.

“Other Act of Terrorism” as used in this subparagraph A.2. shall mean any violent act or act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; that results in physical loss or damage; that is committed by an individual or individuals acting on behalf of any person or interest as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States government by coercion, which is not a “Certified Act of Terrorism” under the terms of TRIA.

^If TRIA is: (a) not extended, renewed, or succeeded without interruption beyond 31 [[Date 21]], or (b) extended, renewed, or succeeded beyond 31 [[Date 21]], but with revision or adaptation to one or more of the definitions set forth in subsections 102 (1)(A), (14), and (15) of TRIA, then, in respect of any losses occurring after 31 December 2005, this contract shall not cover:

^Losses resulting directly or indirectly from an Act of Terrorism.

^Loss or damage directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological explosion, pollution, or contamination resulting from any Other Act of Terrorism. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Contract shall extend to cover insured physical loss or damage, excluding all time-element coverages and extensions, incurred as a direct and immediate consequence of an Other Act of Terrorism employing any non-nuclear weapon or device designed to disperse chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants; however, no coverage shall be afforded for any ensuing chemical, biological, or radiological contamination or pollution resulting from employing such weapon or device.

^^^^^ 
“Act of Terrorism” as used in subparagraphs B.1. and B.2. shall mean any violent act or act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; that results in physical loss or damage within the United States; and that is committed by an individual or individuals acting on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest as part of an effort to coerce or put in fear the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States government by coercion. 

“Other Act of Terrorism” as used in subparagraph B(2) above shall mean any violent act or act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure that results in physical loss or damage that is committed by an individual or individuals acting on behalf of any person or interest as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States government by coercion, which is not an “Act of Terrorism.”
