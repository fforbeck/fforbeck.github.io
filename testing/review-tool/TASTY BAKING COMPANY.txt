^^Buyer shall have ninety (90) days from the date of full execution of this Agreement **(the “Feasibility Period”)** to determine whether the Property is suitable for Buyer's intended purpose, on the conditions set forth in paragraph 10 of this Agreement. 

^^If Buyer, in the exercise of its sole discretion, decides that the Property is not suitable for Buyer's intended purpose for any reason or for no reason Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving Notice to this effect to Seller at any time during the Feasibility Period but not thereafter. If such Notice is given, Buyer shall be entitled to a return of its Initial Deposit. Once the Feasibility Period expires and if Buyer has not exercised its right to terminate, Buyer's right to terminate this Agreement under the terms of this paragraph 3 shall expire absolutely, and the Initial Deposit and Additional Deposit shall be non-refundable to Buyer, unless Buyer terminates this Agreement due to Seller’s failure to deliver title in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, at Settlement, the Deposit will be refunded to Buyer provided that the full Purchase Price is paid to Seller in accordance with Paragraph 2b of this Agreement, unless Seller has drawn on the Letter of Credit(s), in which case, the amount drawn down by Seller will be applied to the Purchase Price. 

^^If Buyer does not terminate this Agreement on or prior to ninety (90) days from the date hereof, as provided for in paragraph 3b of this Agreement. Buyer agrees to accept the Property on an **AS IS, WHERE IS** condition, with all faults. Buyer specifically acknowledges that if Settlement occurs, it has agreed to purchase the Property as a result of itsinspection and studies and not due to any warranties, representations or covenants expressed or implied regarding the condition ofthe Property made by Seller or by anyone acting or purporting to act on Seller's behalf except as specifically set forth herein. Buyer further acknowledges that Seller has made no warranty or representation and is making no warranty or representation regarding the environmental condition of the Property. Effective at Settlement and to the fullest extent permitted by law, Buyer hereby releases, discharges and forever acquits Seller and all of Seller’s officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and independent contractors and successors, and each and every one of them, from all demands, claims, liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses, which Buyer may suffer or incur relating to the Property. 

^**Conditions of Settlement****.** 

^^It shall be a condition precedent to Buyer's obligation to settle hereunder that each of the following conditions shall have been satisfied: 

^That Buyer and Seller shall have each executed a copy ofthis Agreement and delivered the same to other; 

^That Seller, at Seller’s expense shall have received a zoning change from the City of Philadelphia substantially in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit “C”** (the **“Zoning Approval**” or the “**Zoning Condition”**). Seller shall diligently and in good faith seek such Zoning Approval. In no event shall Buyer submit applications for governmental approvals and zoning changes or variances, without obtaining Seller’s prior written approval therefore, which approval shall not be unreasonably denied, delayed or conditioned. 

^^If the Zoning Condition is not satisfied by the sixtieth (60th) day following the end of the Feasibility Period, Seller shall have the right to extend the date for Settlement, on the conditions set forth in this paragraph 4b, for up to six (6) month (the **“Zoning Extension Period”),** upon notice to Buyer on or before the first day of the Zoning Extension Period. The right of Seller to extend Settlement shall apply only if an application in furtherance of satisfying the Zoning Condition is pending and the body before which it is pending has not yet issued a final decision. 

^^In the event that the conditions set forth in paragraph 4a of this Agreement are not satisfied within either (i) the 60 day period following the end of the Feasibility Period or (ii) if Seller has exercised its right to extend the date for Settlement as set forth in paragraph 4b of this Agreement, the Zoning Extension Period, Buyer shall have the right either to waive any such condition and proceed to Settlement or to terminate this Agreement by notifying Seller in writing. If Buyer does not waive such condition, the parties direct Escrow Agent to return the Deposit to Buyer and neither party shall have any further liability to the other. Further, if Buyer terminates this Agreement on account of a failure of a condition or because Buyer determines that the Property is not suitable and terminates under paragraph 3 of this Agreement, Buyer agrees to deliver, if and only to the extent specifically requested by Seller in writing, an assignment of Buyer's interests in and to all engineering plans, studies, and other materials to Seller. 

^^Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller in connection with the Zoning Condition including, where necessary, signing application forms if required and executing assignment of permit forms. The parties agree that all costs and expenses associated with the satisfaction of the Zoning Condition as set forth in paragraph 4 of this Agreement shall be assumed by Seller. 

^^Seller’s obligations to close are conditional upon: 

^^^Execution and delivery by Buyer of an agreement between Buyer and Allegheny West Foundation, in form acceptable to Seller, which shall provide that Buyer shall fund not less than $[[USD Value 4: Number]] per year to the Allegheny West Foundation for the longer of (A) so long as Buyer or one of its affiliates owns the Property or (B) ten years (the “**Allegheny West Agreement”)**. 

^^^Seller’s right, at any time prior to Settlement to terminate the Agreement of Sale in order to sell all or a portion of the Property to an entity selected by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board for a Philadelphia Slot License (or to the entity that had previously had an option to buy the Property in connection with its application for a Philadelphia Slot license). In the event of such termination, Seller shall return to Buyer any Deposit, any Additional Deposit, and shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to (i) the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Buyer in connection with its due diligence review of the Property from the date of the Agreement of Sale through the date of such termination; plus (ii) an amount determined as follows: 

*   $[[USD Value 5: Number]] if Seller terminates within 90 days after the date of the Agreement of Sale
*   $[[USD Value 6: Number]] if Seller terminates between 91 and 180 days after the date of the Agreement of Sale; or

For purposes of the foregoing, “Buyer’s Net Profit” in the event Buyer sells the Property to an owner of the Philadelphia Slot License shall equal the difference between (a) the amount paid to Buyer by the owner of the Philadelphia Slot License for the Gaming Portion of the Property, less all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with such sale and (b) the amount paid at Settlement by Buyer to Seller for the Gaming Portion of the Property (which amount shall be calculated by multiplying the square footage of the Gaming Portion of the Property by the per square foot purchase price of the entire Property paid by Buyer to Seller). In the event Buyer leases the Property to an owner of the Philadelphia Slot License, the “Buyer’s Net Profit” shall equal the difference between (a) the rent to be paid over the term of the lease at a capitalization rate agreed to by Buyer and Seller and in the event Buyer and Seller cannot agree to such capitalization rate, such rate will be determined by an appraisal process as to be more particularly set forth in the Gaming Agreement and (b) the amount paid at Settlement by Buyer to Seller for the Gaming Portion of the Property (calculated as set forth above). 

^**Settlement**.** Settlement shall take place at 2600 One Commerce Square, Phila., PA, or at such other place as Buyer and Seller shall agree in writing, on or before the later of (a) sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Feasibility Period, (b) if the Zoning Condition has not been met within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Feasibility Period and Seller has exercised its right to the Zoning Extension Period in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4b of this Agreement, sixty (60) days after receipt of the Zoning Condition, or (c) such other time as Buyer and Seller shall agree in writing **(**the “Settlement”),** but in no event later than eight (8) months after the end of the Feasibility Period.
