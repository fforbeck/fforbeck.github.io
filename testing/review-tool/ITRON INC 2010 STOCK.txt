\centered **ITRON, INC.** 

\centered **2010 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN** 

\centered **RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT** 

\centered **ALL PARTICIPANTS (EXCLUDING FRANCE)** 

Pursuant to your Restricted Stock Unit Award Notice (the “***Award Notice***”) and this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, including Appendices A and B (this “***Agreement***”), Itron, Inc. (the “***Company***”) has granted you a restricted stock unit award (the “***Award***”) under its 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the “***Plan***”) for the number of restricted stock units indicated in your Award Notice. Capitalized terms not expressly defined in this Agreement but defined in the Plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan. 

The details of the Award are as follows: 

^Vesting 

The Award will vest according to the vesting schedule set forth in the Award Notice (the “***Vesting Schedule***). One share of Common Stock will be issuable for each restricted stock unit that vests. Restricted stock units that have vested and are no longer subject to forfeiture according to the Vesting Schedule are referred to herein as “***Vested Units***.” Restricted stock units that have not vested and remain subject to forfeiture under the Vesting Schedule are referred to herein as “***Unvested Units***.” Except as provided in Section 2 below, the Unvested Units will vest (and to the extent so vested cease to be Unvested Units remaining subject to forfeiture) in accordance with the Vesting Schedule (the Unvested and Vested Units are collectively referred to herein as the “***Units***”). The Award will terminate and the Unvested Units will be forfeited upon termination of your employment for any reason. 

^Corporate Transaction/Change in Control 

In the event of a Corporate Transaction (including a Related Party Transaction) that does not meet the definition of Change in Control set forth in Appendix A, your Award will remain unaffected. In the event of a Change in Control as defined in Appendix A, any Unvested Units will accelerate in vesting and become Vested Units immediately prior to such Change in Control. 

^Settlement of Vested Units. 

Vested Units shall be settled within 30 days following (a) the applicable Vest Date, or (b) if earlier, the date the Units become vested in connection with a Change in Control pursuant to Section 2 above. 

^Securities Law Compliance 

^^You represent and warrant that you (a) have been furnished with a copy of the prospectus for the Plan and all information which you deem necessary to evaluate the merits and risks of receipt of the Award, (b) have had the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the information received about the Award and the Company, and (c) have been given the opportunity to obtain any additional information you deem necessary to verify the accuracy of any information obtained concerning the Award and the Company. 

^^You hereby agree that you will in no event sell or distribute all or any part of the shares of Common Stock that you receive pursuant to settlement of this Award (the “***Shares***”) unless (a) there is an effective registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “***Securities Act***”) and any applicable state and foreign securities laws covering any such transaction involving the Shares or (b) the Company receives an opinion of your legal counsel (concurred in by legal counsel for the Company) stating that such transaction is exempt from registration or the Company otherwise satisfies itself that such transaction is exempt from registration. You understand that the Company has no obligation to you to register the Shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any foreign securities regulator and has not represented to you that it will so register the Shares. 

^^You confirm that you have been advised, prior to your receipt of the Shares, that neither the offering of the Shares nor any offering materials have been reviewed by any regulator under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities act (the “***Acts***”) and that the Shares cannot be resold unless they are registered under the Acts or unless an exemption from such registration is available. 

^^You hereby agree to indemnify the Company and hold it harmless from and against any loss, claim or liability, including attorneys’ fees or legal expenses, incurred by the Company as a result of any breach by you of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty or statement made by you in this Agreement or the breach by you of any terms or conditions of this Agreement. 

^Transfer Restrictions 

Units shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, encumbered, pledged or otherwise disposed of, whether voluntarily or by operation of law. 

^No Rights as Shareholder 

You shall not have voting or other rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to the Units. 

^Book Entry Registration of Shares 

The Company will issue the Shares by registering the Shares in book entry form with the Company’s transfer agent in your name and the applicable restrictions will be noted in the records of the Company’s transfer agent and in the book entry system. 

^Responsibility for Taxes 

^^Regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the “***Employer***”) take with respect to any and all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“***Tax-Related Items***”), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company and/or the Employer. You further acknowledge that the Company and the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including, but not limited to, the granting or vesting of the Award, the settlement of Vested Units, the issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Vested Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Vested Units and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 

^^Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. 

^^In this regard, you hereby irrevocably appoint Fidelity or any stock plan service provider or brokerage firm designated by the Company for such purpose (the “***Agent***”) as your Agent, and authorize the Agent, to: 

^^^Sell on the open market at the then prevailing market price(s), on your behalf, as soon as practicable on or after the settlement date for any Vested Unit, the minimum number of Shares (rounded up to the next whole number) sufficient to generate proceeds to cover the Tax-Related Items and all applicable fees and commissions due to, or required to be collected by, the Agent;

^^^Remit directly to the Company the cash amount necessary to cover the Tax-Related Items;

^^^Retain the amount required to cover all applicable fees and commissions due to, or required to be collected by, the Agent, relating directly to the sale of Shares referred to in clause (i) above; and

^^^Remit any remaining funds to you.

^^Alternatively, or in addition to or in combination with the withholding mechanism described in Section 8.2(a), you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by: 

^^^requiring you to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of the Tax-Related Items; and/or

^^^withholding any amount of the Tax-Related Items from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer; and/or

^^^withholding in Shares to be issued upon settlement of the Vested Units.

^^To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Vested Units notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver Shares to you if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 

^^You acknowledge that the authorization and instruction to the Agent set forth in Section 8.2(a)(i) above to sell Shares to cover the Tax-Related Items is intended to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) under the Exchange Act and to be interpreted to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act (regarding trading of the Company’s securities on the basis of material nonpublic information) (a “***10b5-1 Plan***”). This 10b5-1 Plan is being adopted to permit you to sell a number of Shares issued upon settlement of Vested Units sufficient to pay the Tax-Related Items. 

You acknowledge that the broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of Shares at any particular price. You further acknowledge that you will be responsible for all brokerage fees and other costs of sale, and you agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. You acknowledge that it may not be possible to sell Shares during the term of this 10b5-1 Plan due to (a) a legal or contractual restriction applicable to you or to the broker, (b) a market disruption, (c) rules governing order execution priority on the NASDAQ or other exchange where the Shares may be traded, (d) a sale effected pursuant to this 10b5-1 Plan that fails to comply (or in the reasonable opinion of the Agent’s counsel is likely not to comply) with the Securities Act, or (e) if the Company determines that sales may not be effected under this 10b5-1 Plan. In the event of the Agent’s inability to sell Shares, you will continue to be responsible for the Tax-Related Items. 

You hereby agree to execute and deliver to the Agent any other agreements or documents as the Agent reasonably deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and intent of the 10b5-1 Plan. You acknowledge that this 10b5-1 Plan is subject to the terms of any policy adopted now or hereafter by the Company governing the adoption of 10b5-1 plans. The Agent is a third party beneficiary of Section 8.2(a)(i) and this 10b5-1 Plan.
