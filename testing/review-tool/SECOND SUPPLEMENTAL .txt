This Note is one of a duly authorized series of special limited obligations of the Company (hereinafter called the “Securities”) all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of [[Date 2]], as amended or supplemented (hereinafter called the “Indenture”), duly executed and delivered by the Company and [[Trustee]], National Association, as trustee (hereinafter called the “Trustee”), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee and the rights thereunder of the holders of the Securities. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the “TIA”), as in effect on the date of the Indenture. The Securities are subject to, and qualified by, all such terms, certain of which are summarized hereon, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of such terms. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more separate series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, mature at different times, bear interest at different rates, be subject to different covenants and events of default, and otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. 

If an Event of Default described in Section 5.1(3) or (4) of the Indenture occurs and is continuing, the unpaid stated principal amount hereof will become and be immediately due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. 

^^^^^ 
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of Securities affected thereby, at the time Outstanding, evidenced as provided in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any indenture supplemental thereto or modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of this Note; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of maturity thereof or change the place of payment where, or change the coin or currency in which, any installment of principal and interest on any such Security is payable or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof, (2) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such amendment or supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or certain defaults thereunder and their consequences) with respect to the Securities, or (3) modify any of the provisions of Section 8.2, Section 5.4 (clauses (1) and (2)) or Section 5.7 of the Indenture, except to increase the percentage of Outstanding Securities required for such actions to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby.

Any such consent by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or other such Notes. 

This Note is not entitled to any sinking fund. This Note is not redeemable at the option of the Holder. The Company shall redeem all of the Outstanding Notes of the series of which this Note forms a part for [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the outstanding principal amount of such Notes if the Corresponding Member Loan has been obtained as a result of identity theft on the part of the purported borrower member.

The Notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] and integral multiples of $[[USD Value 1]] in excess thereof. The Notes may not be transferred and the transfer of Notes shall not be registered as provided in the Indenture unless such transfer is effected on a trading system that is recognized by the Company.

The Company, the Trustee, and any paying agent may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note at the Holder’s address as it appears on the register books of the Company as kept by the Company or duly authorized agent of the Company (whether or not this Note shall be overdue), for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account hereof and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All payments made to or upon the order of such registered Holder shall, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, effectively satisfy and discharge liability for moneys payable on this Note. 

^^^^^ 
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company, either directly or through the Company, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such personal liability of every such incorporator, shareholder, officer and director, as such, being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as a condition of and as part of the consideration for the issuance of this Note. 

Unless otherwise defined herein, terms used herein which are defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture. To the extent that provisions contained in this Note are inconsistent with the provisions set forth in the Indenture, the provisions contained herein will apply. 

This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to any principle of conflict of laws that would require or permit the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
