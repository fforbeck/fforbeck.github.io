Effective as of the receipt of the full amount of the Expenses at the account set forth in Exhibit B hereto, each Purchaser, for itself and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, on behalf of its Controlled Affiliates (as defined herein) and its and their former, current or future officers, directors, agents, representatives, managing directors, partners (including limited partners), managers, principals, members, employees, predecessor entities, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of any said person or entity and any other person claiming (now or in the future) through or on behalf of any of said entities (“ Purchaser Releasing Parties”), hereby unequivocally, fully and irrevocably releases and discharges the Company, the General Partner, their parents, subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective former, current or future officers, directors, managing directors, managers, principals, members, employees and attorneys and other advisors and agents (including financial and legal advisors and debt and equity financing sources), predecessor entities, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of any said person or entity (collectively, “Company Released Persons”), from any and all past, present, direct, indirect and/or derivative liabilities, claims, rights, actions, causes of action, counts, obligations, sums of money due, attorneys’ fees, suits, debts, covenants, agreements, promises, demands, damages and charges of whatever kind or nature, known or unknown, in law or in equity, asserted or that could have been asserted, under federal or state statute, or common law or the laws of any other relevant jurisdiction, arising from or out of, based upon, in connection with or otherwise relating in any way to the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined herein), the Merger Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the negotiation thereof and all due diligence activities and other actions or activities undertaken in connection therewith, collectively, the “Pre-Signing Matters”), the Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Employment Agreements or the transactions or payments contemplated by any of the foregoing, including any claim relating to the termination of the Merger Agreement, or to Losses (as defined herein) incurred by the Purchaser Releasing Parties on or prior to the date hereof (including expenses relating to the period on or prior to the date hereof without regard to the date of invoice) relating to the Unitholder Litigations (as defined herein), and including any acts, omissions, disclosures or communications (including with respect to any actual or omitted public disclosures) related to the Merger Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Signing Matters), the Confidentiality Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Employment Agreements or the transactions or payments contemplated by any of the foregoing, or to Losses incurred by the Purchaser Releasing Parties on or prior to the date hereof (including expenses relating to the period on or prior to the date hereof without regard to the date of invoice) relating to the Unitholder Litigations (including press releases, public filings, and the solicitation of proxies) (the “Purchaser Released Claims”); provided, however that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to release the Company from its obligations to pay to Parent (or as otherwise directed by Parent) the Breakup Fee pursuant to Section 7.03(b)(i) of the Merger Agreement or otherwise, it being acknowledged that the Expenses paid hereunder shall reduce the amount of any Breakup Fee payable as provided in the Merger Agreement (without regard to the requirement that any such Expenses be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement); and provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to release any party hereto from its obligations under this Agreement or any agreement among any of the parties hereto entered into subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that any claim is asserted against any of the Purchaser Releasing Parties by any party before any court, arbitrator or other tribunal in any jurisdiction that concerns the subject matter of any of the Purchaser Released Claims (a “Third Party Claim”), nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any such Purchaser Releasing Party from impleading or asserting any claim for contribution or indemnification against any Company Released Person with respect to such Third Party Claim. In the event that any claim asserted against any of the Purchaser Releasing Parties by any Company Released Person before any court, arbitrator or other tribunal in any jurisdiction (whether as a claim, a cross claim, or counterclaim) that concerns the subject matter of any of the Released Claims (as defined below) is not barred by Section 5.4 of this Agreement, this Agreement shall not prevent any such Purchaser Releasing Party from asserting any Released Claim against such Company Released Person. 

^Company Releases. Effective as of Purchasers’ receipt of the full amount of the Expenses at the account set forth in Exhibit B hereto, the Company and the General Partner, for themselves and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, on behalf of their Controlled Affiliates and their respective former, current or future respective officers, directors, agents, representatives, managing directors, partners (including limited partners), managers, principals, members, employees, predecessor entities, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of any said person or entity, security holders of any said person or entity (including holders of limited partnership interests (including Depositary Units) in the Company or other securities in the Company) and any other person claiming (now or in the future) through or on behalf of any of said entities (“ Company Releasing Parties” and together with the Purchaser Releasing Parties, the “Releasing Parties”), hereby unequivocally, fully and irrevocably release and discharge each Purchaser, its Related Parties and its and their parents, subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective former, current or future officers, directors, managing directors, managers, principals, members, employees and attorneys and other advisors and agents (including financial and legal advisors and debt and equity financing sources), predecessor entities, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of any said person or entity (collectively, “ Purchaser Released Persons” and together with the Company Released Persons, the “ Released Persons”), from any and all past, present, direct, indirect and/or derivative liabilities, claims, rights, actions, causes of action, counts, obligations, sums of money due, attorneys’ fees, suits, debts, covenants, agreements, promises, demands, damages and charges of whatever kind or nature, known or unknown, in law or in equity, asserted or that could have been asserted, under federal or state statute, or common law or the laws of any other relevant jurisdiction, arising from or out of, based upon, in connection with or otherwise relating in any way to the Confidentiality Agreement, Merger Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Signing Matters), the Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Employment Agreements or the transactions or payments contemplated by any of the foregoing, including any claim relating to the termination of the Merger Agreement (including any claim for payment of the Maximum Recovery Amount or otherwise), or to the Unitholder Litigations, and including any acts, omissions, disclosure or communications (including with respect to any actual or omitted public disclosures) related to the Merger Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Signing Matters), the Confidentiality Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Employment Agreements or the transactions or payments contemplated by any of the foregoing, or the Unitholder Litigation (including press releases, public filings, and the solicitation of proxies) (the “ Company Parties Released Claims,” and, together with the Purchaser Released Claims, the “ Released Claims”); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to release any party hereto from its obligations under this Agreement (including under Section 5.6) or any agreement among any of the parties hereto entered into subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that any claim is asserted against any of the Company Releasing Parties by any party before any court, arbitrator or other tribunal in any jurisdiction that concerns the subject matter of any of the Company Parties Released Claims and for which the Purchaser Indemnified Persons are not entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 5.6 hereof (a “ Company Third Party Claim”), nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any such Company Releasing Party from impleading or asserting any claim for contribution or indemnification against any Purchaser Released Person with respect to such Company Third Party Claim. In the event that any claim asserted against any of the Company Releasing Parties by any Purchaser Released Person before any court, arbitrator or other tribunal in any jurisdiction (whether as a claim, a cross claim, or counterclaim) that concerns the subject matter of any of the Released Claims is not barred by Section 5.4 of this Agreement, this Agreement shall not prevent any such Company Releasing Party from asserting any Released Claim against such Purchaser Released Person. 

^Scope of Release and Discharge. 

^^The parties, on behalf of the respective Releasing Parties, acknowledge and agree that they may be unaware of or may discover facts in addition to or different from those which they now know, anticipate or believe to be true related to or concerning the Released Claims. The parties know that such presently unknown or unappreciated facts could materially affect the claims or defenses of a party or parties. It is nonetheless the intent of the parties to give a full, complete and final release and discharge of the Released Claims. In furtherance of this intention, the releases herein given shall be and remain in effect as full and complete releases with regard to the Released Claims notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or different claim or fact. To that end, with respect to the Released Claims only, the parties expressly waive and relinquish any and all provisions, rights and benefits conferred by any law of the United States or of any state or territory of the United States or of any other relevant jurisdiction, or principle of common law, under which a general release does not extend to claims which the parties do not know or suspect to exist in their favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by the parties might have affected the parties’ settlement. With respect to the Released Claims only, the parties expressly waive and relinquish, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the provisions, rights, and benefits of §1542 of the California Civil Code, or any New York or other state’s counterpart thereto, which provides: 

^GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. 

^^The parties acknowledge and agree that the inclusion of this Section 5.3 was separately bargained for and is a key element of this Agreement. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement shall not release, bar or otherwise impair the assertion of any claim whatsoever by any Releasing Party (directly or indirectly, whether as a claim, a cross-claim, counterclaim or otherwise) against any unitholder or security holder of any Company Released Person asserting any claim against such Releasing Party or its affiliate. 

^Covenant Not to Sue. Effective as of the Purchasers’ receipt of the full amount of the Expenses at the account set forth in Exhibit B, each of the parties’ covenants, on behalf of itself, the Company Released Persons and the Company Releasing Parties, in the case of the Company and the General Partner, and the Purchaser Released Persons and the Purchaser Releasing Parties, in the case of the Purchasers, not to bring any Released Claim before any court, arbitrator, or other tribunal in any jurisdiction, whether as a claim, a cross claim, or counterclaim. Any Released Person may plead this Agreement as a complete bar to any Released Claim brought in derogation of this covenant not to sue. The covenants contained in this Section 5.4 shall survive this Agreement indefinitely regardless of any statute of limitations. 

^Accord and Satisfaction. Effective as of the Purchasers’ receipt of the full amount of the Expenses at the account set forth in Exhibit B hereto, this Agreement and the releases reflected in this Agreement shall be effective as a full, final and irrevocable accord and satisfaction and release of all of the Released Claims. 

^Indemnification. 

^^Effective as of the Purchasers’ receipt of the full amount of the Expenses at the account set forth in Exhibit B hereto, the Company and the General Partner agree, jointly and severally, to hold harmless and indemnify each Purchaser, its Related Parties and its and their parents, subsidiaries and affiliates and any Person controlling such Purchaser or such Purchaser’s affiliates, or controlled by such Purchaser or such Purchaser’s affiliates and their respective former, current or future officers, directors, managing directors, partners, managers, principals, members, employees and attorneys and other advisors and agents (including financial and legal advisors and debt and equity financing sources), predecessor entities, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of any said person or entity (collectively, the “Purchaser Indemnified Persons”) from and against any and all losses, claims, judgments, damages, liabilities and expenses, including any payments made in settlement of any such claims (each a “Loss” and collectively, the “Losses”) whatsoever (including reasonable expenses incurred in preparing or defending against any litigation or proceeding, commenced or threatened, or any claims whatsoever whether or not resulting in any liability) imposed on or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Person, to the extent that such Loss results from any claim or cause of action brought by or on behalf of one or more former, present or future holders of limited partnership interests (including Depositary Units) in the Company or other securities of the Company (including any direct or derivative claim) based upon the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Signing Matters), the Confidentiality Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Employment Agreements and the Limited Guarantee or the transactions or payments contemplated thereby, including any claim relating to the termination of the Merger Agreement (including any claim for payment of the Maximum Recovery Amount), or to the Unitholder Litigations, and including any acts, omissions, disclosure or communications (including with respect to any actual or omitted public disclosures) related to the Merger Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Signing Matters), the Confidentiality Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Employment Agreements and the Limited Guarantee or the transactions or payments contemplated thereby, or the Unitholder Litigation (including press releases, public filings, and the solicitation of proxies) or any other matters related to or arising out of any of the foregoing; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnification provision shall not apply to (i) any Losses relating to the Unitholder Litigations that were incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties on or prior to the date hereof (including expenses relating to the period on or prior to the date hereof without regard to the date of invoice), (ii) expenses (including legal fees, but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any amounts in respect of claims, judgments, awards, damages, amounts in settlement of any such claims and similar Losses) relating to the Unitholder Litigations incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties after the date hereof that are in excess of One Hundred Fifty-Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]) in the aggregate and (iii) any Losses that are finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the willful misconduct of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons or any material breach by the Purchasers of this Agreement. Any person indemnified initially hereunder shall remain so indemnified, regardless of any subsequent change in their position or status that qualified such person for indemnification initially. 

^^If a Purchaser Indemnified Person intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.6 with respect to any claim or cause of action described in Section 5.6(a), such Purchaser Indemnified Person shall promptly provide written notice to the Company and the General Partner (in accordance with Section 6.6 hereof) describing such claim or cause of action in reasonable detail and providing copies of all material written evidence thereof and the estimated amount of the Losses that have been or may be sustained by such Purchaser Indemnified Person provided that the failure to provide such notice or information shall not affect the obligations of the Company and the General Partner unless they are actually materially prejudiced thereby. In the case of any claim or cause of action which is subject to Section 5.6(a), the Company and the General Partner will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent they elect by written notice delivered to the Purchaser Indemnified Person(s), to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser Indemnified Person(s); provided that if the defendants in any such proceedings include both a Purchaser Indemnified Person and one of the Company, the General Partner or any of their affiliates and the Purchaser Indemnified Person shall have concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company, the General Partner or their affiliates, the Purchaser Indemnified Person shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such proceedings on behalf of such Purchaser Indemnified Person. Upon receipt of notice by the Company and the General Partner to such Purchaser Indemnified Person of their election to assume the defense of such proceedings and approval by the Purchaser Indemnified Person of counsel, the Company and the General Partner will not be liable to such Purchaser Indemnified Person for expenses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable costs of investigation) unless (i) the Purchaser Indemnified Person shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the Company and the General Partner shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) representing the Purchaser Indemnified Persons who are parties to such proceedings), (ii) the Company and the General Partner shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser Indemnified Person to represent the Purchaser Indemnified Person within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the proceedings or (iii) the Company and the General Partner shall have authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the Purchaser Indemnified Person. The Purchasers shall not agree to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or cause of action, without the prior written consent of the Company and the General Partner, such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. 

\centered **MISCELLANEOUS**

Other than as a party may determine based on advice of counsel is necessary to respond to any legal or regulatory process or proceeding or to give appropriate testimony or file any necessary documents in any legal or regulatory proceeding or as may be required by law, each of the parties hereto will use its commercially reasonable efforts not to make any public statements (including in any filing with the SEC or any other regulatory or governmental agency, including any stock exchange, or except as may be required by law) that are inconsistent with, or otherwise contrary to, the jointly approved statements in the press release issued pursuant to this Section 6.1.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes all other prior (but not subsequent) agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and thereof; provided, however, that the obligations of the parties set forth in those portions of the Merger Agreement which, by the terms of the Merger Agreement, survive the termination of the Merger Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger (other than Exhibit B to the Merger Agreement) shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that each of the non-party Released Persons are express third party beneficiaries of the releases of such non-party Released Persons contained in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, covenants not to sue contained in Section 5.4 of this Agreement and indemnities set forth in Section 5.6 and are entitled to enforce rights under such sections to the same extent that such non-party Released Persons could enforce such rights if they were a party to this Agreement.
