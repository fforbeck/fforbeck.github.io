^^Each Global Debenture authenticated under this Fourth Supplemental Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a custodian, and each such Global Debenture shall constitute a single Debenture for purposes of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture. 

^^Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the Base Indenture or the Debentures, no Global Debentures may be exchanged in whole or in part for Debentures registered, and no transfer of a Global Debenture in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary or a nominee thereof unless (A) the Depositary (x) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Debenture or (y) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and a successor depositary has not been appointed by the Company within 90 calendar days, or (B) the Company, at any time and in its sole discretion, notifies the Trustee in writing that it no longer wishes to have all the Debentures represented by Global Debentures. Any Global Debentures exchanged pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be so exchanged in whole and not in part. 

^^In addition, certificated Debentures shall be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in a Global Debenture upon request by or on behalf of the Depositary in accordance with customary procedures following the request of a beneficial owner seeking to enforce its rights under the Debentures or this Indenture, including its rights following the occurrence of an Event of Default. 

^^Debentures issued in exchange for a Global Debenture or any portion thereof pursuant to clause (b) or (c) above shall be issued in definitive, global form, without interest coupons, shall have a principal amount equal to that of such Global Debenture or portion thereof to be so exchanged, and shall be registered in such names and be in such authorized denominations as the Depositary shall designate and shall bear the legend of the Depository set forth in Exhibit A hereto. Any Global Debenture to be exchanged in whole shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee or the Registrar. With regard to any Global Debenture to be exchanged in part, either such Global Debenture shall be so surrendered for exchange or, if the Trustee is acting as custodian for the Depositary or its nominee with respect to such Global Debenture, the principal amount thereof shall be reduced, by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Registrar. Upon any such surrender or adjustment, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Debenture issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or an authorized representative thereof. 

^^Subject to the provisions of Section 2.05(g) below, the registered Holder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members (as defined below) and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Fourth Supplemental Indenture or the Debentures. 

^^In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 2.05(b) above or upon any request described in Section 2.05(c) above, the Company will promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of certificated Debentures in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons. 

^^Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depositary (collectively, the “**Agent Members**”) nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this Fourth Supplemental Indenture or the Base Indenture with respect to any Global Debenture registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global Debenture, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Debenture for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company or the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other Person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any Debenture. 

^^At such time as all interests in a Global Debenture have been repurchased, converted, cancelled or exchanged for Debentures in certificated form, such Global Debenture shall, upon receipt thereof, be cancelled by the Trustee in accordance with standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depositary and the custodian for the Global Debenture, subject to Section 2.12 of the Base Indenture. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Debenture is repurchased, converted, canceled or exchanged for Debentures in certificated form, the principal amount of such Global Debenture shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depositary and the custodian for the Global Debenture, be appropriately reduced, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Debenture, by the Trustee or the custodian for the Global Debenture, at the direction of the Trustee, to reflect such reduction. 

^Restrictions on Transfer. 

^^Every Debenture (and all securities issued in exchange therefore on in substitution thereof) that bears or is required under this Fourth Supplemental Indenture to bear the 144A restricted legend as forth in Exhibit A (the “**Restricted Securities**”) shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 2.06 (including those set forth in the restricted legend (the “**Restricted Debenture Legend**”) in Exhibit A) until such Restricted Debenture Legend is removed. As used in this Section 2.06(a) the term “transfer” means any sale, pledge, loan, transfer or other disposition whatsoever of any Restricted Security or any interest therein. 

^^Until the date that is the later of (1) the Free Trade Date or such other period of time as permitted by Rule 144 and (2) such later date, in any, as may be required by applicable laws, any certificate evidencing a Restricted Security shall bear the Restricted Debenture Legend, unless (i) such Restricted Security has been sold or otherwise transferred to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Security Act (and which continues to be effective at the time of such transfer), (iii) pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act (if available) or (iv) any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 

^^In connection with any transfer of the Debentures prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date, the holder must complete and deliver the form of assignment set forth on the certificate representing the Debenture, with the appropriate box checked, to the Trustee (or any successor Trustee, as applicable). 

^^Any certificated Debenture (or any security issued in exchange or substitution therefor) that has been transferred, replaced or exchanged on or after the Free Trade Date or that has been transferred pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act may be exchanged for a new certificated Debenture or Debentures of like tenor and aggregate principal amount that do not bear the Restricted Debenture Legend required by Section 2.06(a) hereof. To exercise such right of exchange, the Holder of such Debenture must surrender such Debenture in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.05(d) hereof and deliver any additional documentation reasonably required by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar in connection with such exchange. 

^^If, on the Free Trade Date, or the next succeeding Business Day if the Free Trade Date is not a Business Day, any Debentures are represented by a Global Debenture that is subject to the restrictions set out in Section 2.06(a) (any such Global Debenture, a “**Restricted Global Debenture**”), as promptly as practicable, the Company will automatically exchange every beneficial interest in each Restricted Global Debenture for beneficial interests in Global Debentures that are not subject to the restrictions set forth in the Restricted Debenture Legend and in Section 2.06(a) hereof (an “**Unrestricted Global Debenture**”). 

To effect such automatic exchange (the “**Automatic Exchange**”), the Company will (A) deliver to the Depositary an instruction letter for the Depositary’s mandatory exchange process at least 15 days immediately prior to the Free Trade Date and (B) deliver to each of the Trustee and the Registrar (i) a duly completed free transferability certificate in the form set forth on Exhibit B (the “**Free Transferability Certificate**”) at least 5 days prior to the Free Trade Date, (ii) an Authentication Order at least 5 days prior to the Free Trade Date and (iii) an Officers’ Certificate at least 5 days prior to the Free Trade Date; *provided,* that notwithstanding any requirements under the Base Indenture pursuant to Section 12.04, Section 12.05 or otherwise, solely for purposes of this Section 2.06(e), no opinion of counsel will be required for the Trustee to take any action requested or required pursuant to the Free Transferability Certificate and the corresponding Authentication Order and Officers’ Certificate delivered pursuant to this Section 2.06(e) only. The first date on which the Trustee authenticates the Freely Tradable Debentures and the Depository initiates the mandatory exchange shall be known as the “**Resale Restriction Termination Date**.” 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.06, the Company will not be required to deliver the Free Transferability Certificate if it reasonably believes that removal of the Restricted Debentures Legend or the changes to the CUSIPs for the Debentures could result in or facilitate transfers of the Debentures in violation of applicable law. 

^Additional Debentures. The Company may, from time to time, subject to compliance with any other applicable provisions of this Indenture, without the consent of the Holders, create and issue pursuant to this Indenture additional Debentures (“**Additional Debentures**”), which shall be treated as a single class with the Debentures issued on the Closing Date for all purposes under this Indenture and which shall have terms and conditions set for in Exhibit A identical to those of the other outstanding Debentures, except that Additional Debentures: 

^^^may have a different issue price than other outstanding Debentures;

^^^may have a different Issue Date from other outstanding Debentures; and

^^^may have a different amount of interest payable on the first Interest Payment Date after issuance that is payable on other outstanding Debentures;

*provided*, that no Additional Debentures may be issued if such Additional Debentures would constitute, as determined pursuant to an Opinion of Counsel, a different class of securities than the Debentures issued on the Issue Date for U.S. federal income tax purposes and provided further, and that the Additional Debentures have the same CUSIP number as other outstanding Debentures. No Additional Debentures may be issued if any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 

^Defaulted Interest. Notwithstanding Section 2.13 of the Base Indenture, if the Company defaults on a payment of interest on the Debentures, the Company shall pay the defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest at the rate of [[Percentage 7: Number]]% per annum above the then applicable interest rate from the required payment date to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the Persons who are Debentureholders on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to each Debentureholder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. 

^Registrar, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and’ Trustee. 

^^In addition to Section 2.4 of the Base Indenture, the Company shall maintain an office or agency where Debentures may be presented for conversion (the “**Conversion Agent**”). The Company hereby initially designates the Trustee as the Conversion Agent. The Company further designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee as its office where Debentures may be surrendered for conversion. 

The Company may at any time and from time to time vary or terminate the appointment of any such office or appoint any additional offices for any or all purposes; *provided*, *however*, that until all of the Debentures have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or moneys sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Debentures have been made available for payment and either paid or returned to the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.03 hereof, the Company shall maintain an office or agency where Debentures may be surrendered for conversion.

Notwithstanding Article 5 of the Base Indenture, the following Article 4 (and not Article 5 of the Base Indenture) shall apply for purposes of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the Debentures. 

^When Company May Merge, Etc .. The Company shall not, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, consolidate with or merge into any other Person or sell, convey, transfer or lease its property and assets substantially as an entirety to another Person unless: 

^^either (i) the Company is the continuing corporation, or (ii) the directly resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if other than the Company) is a corporation or limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and such Person assumes, by a supplemental indenture, all of the Company’s obligations under the Debentures and the Indenture; 

^^immediately after giving effect to the transaction described above, no Default or Event of Default, has occurred and is continuing; 

^^if as a result of such transaction, common stock or other securities issued by a third party would be Reference Property and such third party fully and unconditionally assumes or guarantees all obligations of the Company or such surviving Person under the Debentures and the Indenture; and 

^^the Company has, at or prior to the effective date of such consolidation, merger or transfer, delivered to the Trustee the Officers’ Certificate and Opinion of Counsel pursuant to Section 4.03. 

^Successor Substituted. In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or lease in which the Company is not the continuing corporation and upon the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Trustee, of the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all of the Debentures, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions of the Indenture to be performed or satisfied by the Company, such successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company, with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the party of this first part, and SunPower Corporation shall be discharged from its obligations under the Debentures and the Indenture. Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of SunPower Corporation any or all of the Debentures, issuable hereunder that theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor Person instead of the Company and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in the Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver, or cause to be authenticated and delivered, any Debentures that previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and any Debentures that such successor Person thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All the Debentures so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under the Indenture as the Debentures theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as though all of such Debentures had been issued at the date of the execution hereof. In the event of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or lease, upon compliance with this Article 4 the Person named as the “Company” in the first paragraph of the Indenture or any successor that shall thereafter have become such in the manner prescribed in this Article 4 may be dissolved, wound up and liquidated at any time thereafter and such Person shall be discharged from its liabilities as obligor and maker of the Debentures and from its obligations under the Indenture. 

^Opinion of Counsel to be Given Trustee. Prior to execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article 4, the Trustee shall receive an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or lease and any such assumption complies with the provisions of this Article 4. 

\centered **Default and Remedies** 

^Events of Default. 

Notwithstanding Section 6.1 of the Base Indenture, the following Section 5.01 (and Section 6.1 of the Base Indenture shall not apply) shall apply for purposes of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the Debentures. 

An “**Event of Default**” shall occur when any of the following occurs (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be occasioned by the provisions of Article 4 hereof or be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): 

^^the Company shall fail to pay any interest on the Debentures when due and such failure continues for a period of 30 calendar days; or

^^the Company fails to pay when due (whether at stated maturity or otherwise) or a default that results in the acceleration of maturity, of any Debt for borrowed money in excess of $[[USD Value 7: Number]] of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company, unless such Debt is discharged or such acceleration is rescinded, stayed or annulled, within a period of 30 calendar days after written notice of such failure or default to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by Holders of at least [[Percentage 9]]% in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Debentures; or 

^^the Company or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:

The term “**Bankruptcy Law**” means Title 11 of the United States Code (or any successor thereto) or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term “**Custodian**” means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law. 

^Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. Notwithstanding Section 6.2 of the Base Indenture, this Section 5.02 (and not Section 6.2 of the Base Indenture) shall apply for purposes of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the Debentures. 

If an Event of Default with respect to outstanding Debentures (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(g) or 5.01(h) hereof) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least [[Percentage 9]]% in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Debentures, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare due and payable [[Percentage 8]]% of the principal amount of all outstanding Debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of payment. Upon a declaration of acceleration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of payment shall be immediately due and payable. 

If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(g) or 5.01(h) hereof occurs and continues with respect to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, all unpaid principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding Debentures shall become and be immediately due and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. 

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures by written notice to the Trustee may rescind and annul an acceleration and its consequences if prior to the Trustee obtaining a judgment or decree for payment of the money due: 

^the Company has paid (or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay) (i) all overdue interest on all Debentures; (ii) the principal amount of any Debentures that has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration; (iii) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest; and (iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and 

^all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of principal or accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures which has become due solely because of the acceleration, have been cured or waived, 

*provided, however*, that in the event such declaration of acceleration has been made based on the existence of an Event of Default under Section 5.01(f) hereof and such Event of Default has been remedied, cured or waived in accordance with Section 5.01(f) hereof, then, without any further action by the Holders, such declaration of acceleration shall be rescinded automatically and the consequences of such declaration shall be annulled. No such rescission or annulment shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereon. 

^Waiver of Past Defaults. Notwithstanding Section 6.13 of the Base Indenture, this Section 5.03 (and not 6.13 of the Base Indenture) shall apply for purposes of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the Debentures. The Holders, either (a) through the written consent of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures or (b) by the adoption of a resolution, at a meeting of Holders of the outstanding Debentures at which a quorum is present, by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures, may, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Debentures, waive an existing Default or Event of Default, except a Default or Event of Default: 

^in the payment of the principal of or interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on any Debenture; 

^in respect of the right to convert any Debenture in accordance with Article 7; 

^in the payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price on the Fundamental Repurchase Date in connection with the repurchase right under Section 2.10 hereof; or 

^in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which, under Section 6.02 hereof, cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Debenture affected thereby. 

Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of the Indenture; *provided*, *however*, that no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. 

^Limitation on Suits. Notwithstanding Section 6.7 of the Base Indenture, this Section 5.04 (and not Section 6.7 of the Base Indenture) shall apply for purposes of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the Debentures. 

Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Debentures unless: 

^^the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing; 

^^the Holders of at least [[Percentage 9]]% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; 

^^such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any cost, liability or expense; 

^^the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 calendar days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and 

^^the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debentures do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period. 

^Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder. 

^Unconditional Rights of Holders to Receive Payment and to Convert. In addition to the other rights and remedies set forth in this Article 5 and in Article 6 of the Base Indenture (to the extent applicable to the Debentures), notwithstanding any other provision in this Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the Holder of any Debenture shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional and shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder, to receive payment of the principal amount, Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, interest or make-whole premium, if any, in respect of the Debentures held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Debentures and this Fourth Supplemental Indenture, and to convert such Debenture in accordance with Article 7 hereof, and to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective due dates or for the right to convert in accordance with Article 7 hereof. 

^Additional Interest. 

^^If, at any time, the Company fails to file any report that the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than reports on Form 8-K) and the Company does not cure such failure to file within 14 calendar days after the last deadline for filing such report under Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act, the Company shall pay Additional Interest on the Debentures from and including the due date of the report the Company failed to file to and including the date on which the Company files such reports. 

^^The Company shall also pay Additional Interest on the Debentures if the Debentures, if any, do not become Freely Tradeable within one calendar week after the Free Trade Date, or the next succeeding Business Day if such date is not a Business Day, from and including the Free Trade Date until the date on which the Debentures become Freely Tradeable. 

^^Additional Interest payable pursuant to Section 5.06(a) and Section 5.06(b) shall accrue at a rate of [[Percentage 10: Number]]% per annum. 

^^Accrued Additional Interest shall be payable on the same dates in the same manner as interest is paid of the Debentures pursuant to Section 2.03 of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture. Subject to Section 5.06(e), the accrual of Additional Interest shall fulfill all of the Company’s obligations to Holders of Debentures for the failure of the Debentures to be Freely Tradeable. 

^^If the Company is required to pay Additional Interest pursuant to Section 5.06(b), the Company may elect to designate an effective registration statement for the resale of the Debentures. Notwithstanding Section 5.06(b), for each day on which such shelf registration statement remains effective and usable by Holders for the resale of the Debentures, Additional Interest shall not accrue and the Company shall have no obligation to Holders for failing to make the Debentures Freely Tradeable during such time period. Any such registration shall be effected on terms customary for the resale of debentures generally offered in reliance upon Rule 

144A. After the Company has made such a registration statement available for a period of two years, the Company’s obligation to pay Additional Interest under this Section 5.06 as a result of the failure of the Debentures to become Freely Tradeable by the Free Trade Date, pursuant to Section 5.06(b), shall terminate. 

^Failure to Comply with Reporting Covenants. 

^^The sole remedy to Holders for the Company’s failure to comply with the reporting obligations pursuant to Section 3.06 or Section 3.07 hereof (the “**Reporting Obligations**”), shall, for the first 365 days after the occurrence of such failure, consist of the right to receive additional interest (“**Additional Interest**”) on the Debentures at an annual rate equal to [[Percentage 10]]% of the principal amount of the Debentures. Additional Interest shall be paid semiannually in arrears, with the first semi-annual payment due on the first Interest Payment Date following the date on which the Additional Interest began to accrue on any Debentures. Additional Interest shall accrue on all outstanding Debentures from and including the date on which a failure by the Company to comply with its Reporting Obligations first occurs to, but not including, the 365th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which such failure to comply shall have been cured or waived). On such 365th day (or earlier, if the failure to comply with its Reporting Obligations is cured or waived prior to such 365th day), such Additional Interest shall cease to accrue and, if the failure relating to reporting obligations has not been cured or waived prior to such 365th day, the Debentures will be subject to a Fundamental Change under Section 2.10. Filing of a report shall constitute a cure of any failure to file or deliver such report on a timely basis. In the event the Company does not elect to pay Additional Interest upon a failure to comply with its Reporting Obligations in accordance with this Section 5.07, the Debentures will be subject to acceleration as provided in Section 5.02. 

^^If the Company elects to pay Additional Interest in connection with a failure to comply with its Reporting Obligations, the Company shall notify all Holders and the Trustee and Paying Agent of such election on or before the close of business on the date two Business Days after the date upon which such failure first occurs. For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum amount of Additional Interest to be paid under this Section 5.07 for any reason is [[Percentage 10]]% and shall constitute the sole remedy for all the obligations to pay Additional Interest. 

\centered **Amendments; Supplements and Waivers**

After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 6.02 becomes effective, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to deliver such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver. 

\centered **Conversion of Debentures** 

^General Right to Cash Convert. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture, as permitted under Section 7.02, Section 7.03, Section 7.04 and Section 7.05 and prior to the close of business on the second Scheduled Trading Day preceding the Maturity Date, the Holder of any outstanding Debentures shall have the right, at such Holder’s option, to convert the principal amount of the Debentures held by such Holder, or any portion of such principal amount which is an integral multiple of $[[USD Value 8: Number]] into cash based on the Initial Conversion Price (equivalent to the Initial Conversion Rate of approximately [[Shares 1]] shares of Class A Common Stock per $[[USD Value 3]] principal amount of Debentures), subject to adjustment as provided in this Article 7 (the “**Cash Conversion Obligation**”), by surrender of the Debentures so to be converted, together with any required funds, under the circumstances described in this Section 7.01 and in the manner provided in Section 7.06 hereof. 

^^Debentures in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Repurchase Notice exercising such Holder’s right to require the Company to repurchase such Debentures pursuant to Section 2.10 hereof may be converted only if such Repurchase Notice is withdrawn in accordance with Section 2.12 hereof prior to 5:00 p.m., [[Address 2: Address]], on the Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date. 

^^A Holder of Debentures is not entitled to any rights of a holder of Class A Common Stock. 

^Cash Conversion Upon Satisfaction of Market Price Condition. (a) Prior to [[Date 10]], Holders may surrender Debentures for conversion into cash during any Fiscal Quarter commencing after [[Date 11: Date]] (and only during such Fiscal Quarter), if the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Class A Common Stock, for at least 20 Trading Days in the period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the Fiscal Quarter immediately preceding the Fiscal Quarter in which the conversion occurs, is more than [[Percentage 11: Number]]% of the Conversion Price of the Debenture in effect on that last Trading Day of the Fiscal Quarter. Holders may surrender Debentures for conversion into cash at any time on or after [[Date 10]]. 

^^The Trustee shall monitor, at the expense of the Company, the satisfaction of the market price condition described in Section 7.02(a) above and inform the Company during any period in which the Debentures are convertible pursuant to Section 7.02(a). If a Holder requests a determination of whether the market price condition has been satisfied, the Company will instruct the Trustee in writing to determine whether the market price condition has been satisfied and to inform such Holder. 

^Cash Conversion Upon Specified Corporate Transactions. Holders shall have the right to convert their Debentures into cash during the specified period of time described below if the Company: 

^^distributes to all or substantially all holders of Class A Common Stock rights or warrants (other than pursuant to a rights plan) entitling them to purchase, for a period of 45 calendar days or less, shares of Class A Common Stock at a price less than the average of the Volume Weighted Average Prices for the ten Trading Days preceding the declaration date for such distribution; or 

^^distributes to all or substantially all holders of Class A Common Stock cash or other assets, debt securities or rights to purchase the Company’s securities (other than pursuant to a rights plan), which distribution has a per share value exceeding [[Percentage 5]]% of the average of the Volume Weighted Average Prices of the Class A Common Stock for the ten Trading Days preceding the declaration date for such distribution. 

The Company shall notify the Holders and the Trustee in writing at least 20 calendar days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for a distribution pursuant to this Section 7.03. Once the Company has given such notice, Holders may surrender their Debentures for conversion at any time until 5:00 p.m., [[Address 2: Address]], on the Business Day preceding the earlier to occur of the Ex-Dividend Date and any announcement by the Company that such distribution shall not take place.

Holders shall also have the right to convert their Debentures if the Company is a party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of its property and assets that does not constitute a Fundamental Change, in each case pursuant to which the Class A Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities and/or other property, other than in a transaction covered by the exceptions in clause (d)(i) or in clause (d)(ii) of the definition of “Fundamental Change.” In such event, Holders shall have the right to convert their Debentures into cash at any time beginning 15 calendar days prior to the date announced by the Company as the anticipated effective date of the transaction and until and including the date which is 15 calendar days after the date that is the actual effective date of such transaction.

The Company shall notify the Holders and the Trustee in writing of the anticipated effective date of any Fundamental Change at least 10 calendar days prior to such date, to the extent the Company has the knowledge to do so. 

^Cash Conversion Upon Satisfaction of Trading Price Condition. 

^^Holders may surrender Debentures for conversion into cash on any date beginning after [[Date 11]] during the five Business-Day period following any five consecutive Trading-Day period in which the Trading Price per $[[USD Value 3]] principal amount of Debentures, as determined following a request by a Holder of Debentures in accordance with the procedures described in Section 7.05(b) and the definition of “Trading Price” set forth in this Indenture, for each Trading Day of such five Trading-Day period was less than [[Percentage 6]]% of the product of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Class A Common Stock for each day during such five Trading Day period and the then current Conversion Rate. 

^^The Trustee shall determine the Trading Price of the Debentures upon the written request of the Company. The Company shall have no obligation to make that request unless a Holder of Debentures requests that the Company do so. If a Holder provides such request, the Company will instruct the Trustee in writing to determine the Trading Price of the Debentures for each Trading Day until the Trading Price per $[[USD Value 3]] principal amount of Debentures is equal to or greater than [[Percentage 6]]% of the product of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Class A Common Stock on such Trading Day and the then-current Conversion Rate.

^^Upon cash conversion, the Company will deliver to Holders in respect of each $[[USD Value 3]] principal amount of Debentures being cash converted an amount of cash (the “**Settlement Amount**”) equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for the 30 consecutive Trading Days during the Settlement Averaging Period for such Debenture. 

^^Except as described under Section 7.07 below, the Company shall pay the Settlement Amount to a Holder converting its Debenture on the third Business Day immediately following the last Trading Day of the Settlement Averaging Period for such Debenture. 

^^In case any Debentures of a denomination greater than $[[USD Value 3]] shall be surrendered for partial conversion, and subject to Section 2.03 hereof, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of the Debentures so surrendered, without charge to the Holder, a new Debenture or Debentures in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Debentures. 

^^Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as to any such Debentures (or portion thereof) on the date on which the requirements set forth above in this Section 7.06 have been satisfied as to such Debentures (or portion thereof) (the “**Conversion Date**”) and such Debentures will be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., [[Address 2: Address]], on the Conversion Date. 

^^Any Debenture or portion thereof surrendered for conversion during the period from 5:00 p.m., [[Address 2: Address]], on the Record Date for an Interest Payment to 5:00 p.m., [[Address 2: Address]], on the applicable Interest Payment Date, shall be accompanied by payment, in immediately available funds or other funds acceptable to the Company, of an amount equal to the interest otherwise payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount be converted; *provided* that no such payment except no such payment shall be required in connection with conversions of Debentures following the Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date, (2) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, or (3) to the extent of any overdue interest, if any, that exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Debentures. Except as provided above in this Section 7.06 and below in Section 7.08, no separate cash payment or other adjustment shall be made for interest accrued and unpaid on any Debenture converted or for dividends on any shares of Class A Common Stock. 

^^Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Debenture, the Trustee (or other Conversion Agent appointed by the Company), or the custodian for the Global Debenture at the direction of the Trustee (or other Conversion Agent appointed by the Company), shall make a notation on such Global Debenture as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversions of Debentures effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee. 

^^^Upon the conversion of any Debentures, the accrued but unpaid interest, if any, attributable to the period from the Issue Date of the Debentures to, but not including, the Conversion Date, with respect to the converted Debentures, shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the Holder thereof. 

^Adjustment to Conversion Rate Upon a Non-Stock Change of Control. 

^^Each $[[USD Value 3]] principal amount of the Debentures, when convertible, shall be convertible into the number of shares of Class A Common Stock based upon the Conversion Rate which is specified in the form of Debenture attached as Exhibit A hereto, subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 7.07 and Section 7.08 hereof. 

^^Prior to the Maturity Date, if and only to the extent a Holder elects to convert Debentures in connection with a Non-Stock Change of Control at any time beginning on the Business Day following the date on which such Non-Stock Change of Control becomes effective (the “**Effective Date**”) but before 5:00 p.m., [[Address 2: Address]], on the Business Day immediately preceding the related Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, the Company shall increase the Conversion Rate applicable to such converted Debentures by a number of additional shares of Class A Common Stock (the “**Additional Shares**”) as set forth below. A conversion of Debentures shall be deemed to be “in connection with” a Non-Stock Change of Control if the Cash Conversion Notice is received by the Conversion Agent during the period specified in the previous sentence. The number of Additional Shares shall be determined by reference to the table below, based on the Effective Date and the price (the “**Stock Price**”) paid per share for the Class A Common Stock in the Non-Stock Change of Control. If holders of Class A Common Stock receive only cash in the Non-Stock Change of Control, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Class A Common Stock on the five Trading Days prior to, but not including, the Effective Date of such Non-Stock Change of Control. 

The numbers of Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock set forth listed in the table below shall be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted in the same manner in which the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The Stock Prices set forth in the table below shall be adjusted, as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted, to equal the Stock Price applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, of which 

^the numerator shall be the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment and 

^the denominator shall be the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. 

The following table sets forth the Stock Price and number of Additional Shares by which the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted: 

**Stock Price**

If the exact Stock Price and Effective Date are not set forth on the table above and the Stock Price is: 

^^^between two Stock Prices on the table or the Effective Date is between two days on the table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by the Trustee by straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price and the two Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 360-day year; 

^^^in excess of $70.00 per share (subject to adjustment), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversation Rate; or 

^^^less than $18.02 per share (subject to adjustment), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversation Rate. 

Cash deliverable pursuant to this Section 7.07(b) shall be delivered on the settlement date applicable to the relevant conversion. 

The Company shall provide written notice to all Holders and to the Trustee as soon as practicable and if possible at least 20 calendar days prior to the anticipated Effective Date of a Non-Stock Change of Control. The Company must also provide written notice to all Holders and to the Trustee upon the effectiveness of such Non-Stock Change of Control. 

^Conversion Price Adjustments. The Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time as follows: 

^^In case (i) the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Debentures are outstanding, pay a dividend in shares of Class A Common Stock or make a distribution in shares of Class A Common Stock on all or substantially all of its shares of the Class A Common Stock or (ii) the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Class A Common Stock or combined into a smaller number of shares of Class A Common Stock, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 

*CP = CP*       *OS* 
*OS*

where, 

CP= the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately prior to the open of business on the effective date of such subdivision or combination of Common Stock, as the case may be; 

CP = the Conversion Price in effect immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the open of business on the effective date of such subdivision or combination of Common Stock, as the case may be; 

OS = the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately prior to the open of business on the effective date of such subdivision or combination of Common Stock, as the case may be; and 

OS = the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination of Common Stock, as the case may be. 

Any adjustment made under this Section 7.08(a) shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the open of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination. In the event that any dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination of the type described in this Section 7.08(a) is declared or announced but not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution or make such subdivision or combination, to the Conversion Price that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination has not been declared or announced. For the purpose of this Section 7.08(a), the number of shares of Class A Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company. The Company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Class A Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. 

^^In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of Class A Common Stock any rights (or, in the case of rights issued under a shareholder rights plan, such rights separate from the Class A Common Stock), options or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 45 calendar days from the record date for such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of Class A Common Stock (or securities convertible into Class A Common Stock), at a price per share (or a conversion price per share) less than the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Class A Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution (excluding (i) dividends or distributions (including subdivision of Common Stock) and rights, options or warrants referred to in Section 7.08(a) above; (ii) Spin-Offs referred to below in Section 7.08(c); and (iii) distributions of rights to all or substantially all holders of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the adoption of a shareholders rights plan unless such rights have separated in which case the separation date shall be treated as the distribution date for purposes of this adjustment), the Conversion Price shall be decreased based on the following formula (provided that the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the extent that such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or are not distributed): 

*CP = CP*       *OS*  *+ Y*
*OS*  *+ X*

where, 

CP = the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 

CP = the Conversion Price in effect immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 

OS = the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 

^= the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants; and 

^= the number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants divided by the Volume Weighted Average Price of Class A Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. 

For purposes of this Section 7.08(b), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Class A Common Stock at less than the Volume Weighted Average Price of such shares of Class A Common Stock, for each Trading Day in the applicable 10 consecutive Trading-Day period, there shall be taken into account any consideration the Company receives for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration if other than cash to be determined by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. 

Any decrease made under this Section 7.08(b) shall be effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. To the extent such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or termination, the Conversion Price shall be increased to the Conversion Price that would then be in effect had the decrease with respect to the distribution of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of Class A Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Price shall be increased to the Conversion Price that would then be in effect if such Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend had not occurred. 

^^In the case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of any class of Class A Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company or evidences of its Debt or assets or property of the Company (excluding (i) dividends or distributions (including subdivision of Common Stock) and rights, options or warrants referred to in Section 7.08(a) or Section 7.08(b) above; (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash referred to in Section 7.08(e) below; (iii) spin-offs referred to further below in this Section 7.08(c); (iii) Spin-Offs referred to further below in this Section 7.08(c); and (iv) distributions of rights to all or substantially all holders of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the adoption of a shareholder rights plan), then the Conversion Price shall be decreased based on the following formula: 

*CP = CP ×*      *SP  FMV*
*SP*

where, 

CP = the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 

CP = the Conversion Price in effect immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 

SP = the Volume Weighted Average Price of Class A Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; and 

FMV = the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors) of the shares of Capital Stock, evidences of Debt, assets or property distributed with respect to each outstanding share of Class A Common Stock as of the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. 

If the “FMV” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than the Volume Weighted Average Price of Class A Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provisions shall be made so that each Holder of a Debenture shall have the right to receive on conversion in respect of each Debenture held by such Holder, in addition to the Settlement Amount to which such Holder is entitled to receive, the amount and kind of securities and assets such Holder would have received had such Holder already owned a number of shares of 

Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the record date for the distribution of the securities or assets. Any decrease made under the first paragraph of this Section 7.08(c) will become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date of such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, or if any rights, options or warrants are not exercised before their expiration date, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been made. 

In the event any adjustment is made pursuant to this Section 7.08(c) for a payment of a dividend or other distribution on Class A Common Stock of shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a subsidiary (a “**Spin-Off**”), the Conversion Price shall be decreased based on the following formula: 

*CP = CP*       *MP* 
*FMV + MP* where, 

CP = the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off; 

CP = the Conversion Price in effect immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off; 

FMV = the volume weighted average price of the capital stock or similar equity interests distributed to holders of Class A Common Stock applicable to one share of Class A Common Stock over the first 10 consecutive Trading-Day period immediately following, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off (such period, the “**Spin-Off Valuation Period**”); and 

MP = the Volume Weighted Average Price of Class A Common Stock over the Spin-Off Valuation Period. 

The adjustment to the Conversion Price under the preceding paragraph of this Section 7.08(c) shall be made immediately after the open of business on the day after the last day of the Spin-Off Valuation Period, but shall be given effect as of the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off. If the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off is less than 10 Trading Days prior to, and including, the end of the Settlement Averaging Period in respect of any conversion, references within this Section 7.08(c) to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced, for purposes of calculating the affected daily Conversion Prices in respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off to, and including, the last Trading Day of such settlement averaging period. For purposes of determining the Conversion Price, in respect of any conversion during the 10 Trading Days commencing on the Ex-Dividend Date for any Spin-Off, references within the portion of this Section 7.08(c) related to “Spin-Offs” to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off to, but excluding, the relevant Conversion Date. 

^^In case the Company shall make or pay any cash dividend or distribution to all, or substantially all, holders of any class of Common Stock (other than distributions referred to in Section 7.08(e)), the Conversion Price shall be decreased based on the following formula: 

*CP = CP*       *SP*  * C*
*SP*  where, 

CP = the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 

CP = the Conversion Price in effect immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 

SP = the average of the Volume Weighted Average Prices of Class A Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; and 

^= the amount in cash per share the Company pays or distributes to holders of Class A Common Stock. 

If “C” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP” (as defined in this Section 7.08(d), in lieu of the foregoing clause, each Holder shall receive, for each $[[USD Value 3]] principal amount of Debentures, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of Class A Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such cash dividend or distribution. 

The adjustment to the Conversion Price under this Section 7.08(d) shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution. In the event any dividend or distribution described in this Section 7.08(d) is declared but not so paid or made, or is reduced, the new Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared, or had been declared as so reduced. 

^^In case a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Class A Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of consideration per share of Class A Common Stock in excess of the volume weighted price of Class A Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the “**Expiration Date**”), the Conversion Price shall be decreased based on the following formula: 

*CP = CP*       *OS*  *× SP*
*AC +* (*OS × SP* )

where, 

CP = the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date; 

CP = the Conversion Price in effect immediately after the open of business on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date; 

AC = the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors) paid or payable for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer; 

OS = the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the time (the “**Expiration Time**”) such tender or exchange offer expires (prior to giving effect to such tender offer or exchange offer); 

OS = the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Expiration Time (after giving effect to such tender offer or exchange offer); and 

SP = the average of the Volume Weighted Average Prices of Class A Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date. 

The adjustment to the Conversion Price under the preceding paragraph of this Section 7.08(e) shall be given effect at the open of business on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date. If the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date is less than 10 Trading Days prior to, and including, the end of the Settlement Averaging Period in respect of any conversion, references within this Section 7.08(e) to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced, for purposes of calculating the affected daily Conversion Prices in respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date to, and including, the last Trading Day of such Settlement Averaging Period. For purposes of determining the Conversion Price, in respect of any conversion during the 10 Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date, references within this Section 7.08(e) to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date to, but excluding, the relevant Conversion Date. 

^^The Company, in its sole discretion, may make such reductions in the Conversion Price as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Class A Common Stock or rights to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with a dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or any event treated as such for income tax purposes. 

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may decrease the Conversion Price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 Business Days, the decrease is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such decrease would be in the best interest of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Price is decreased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall deliver to Holders of record of the Debentures and the Trustee a notice of the decrease, which notice shall be given at least 15 days prior to the effectiveness of any such decrease, and such notice shall state the decreased Conversion Price and the period during which it will be in effect. 

The Company shall not take any action that would result in adjustment of the Conversion Price, pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.08(f), in such a manner as to result in the reduction of the Conversion Price to less than the par value per share of Class A Common Stock. 

^^The Conversion Price shall not be adjusted: 

^upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company’s securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Class A Common Stock under any such plan; 

^upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of, or assumed by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; 

^upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in the preceding clause (B) and outstanding as of the date the Debentures were first issued; or 

^for accrued and unpaid interest, if any. 

^^Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.08 to the contrary, no adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent ([[Percentage 7]]%) in such Conversion Price; *provided*, *however*, that any adjustments that by reason of this Section 7.08(h) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and the Company shall make such carry forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than [[Percentage 7]]%, (x) upon any conversion of Debentures, (ii) upon any required purchases of the Debentures in connection with a Fundamental Change, and (iii) on each of the 32 Scheduled Trading Days immediately preceding the Maturity Date, as necessary. All calculations under this Article 7 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a dollar. 

^^Except as set forth in this Section 7.08, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Price. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no adjustment to the Conversion Price need be made for a given transaction (other than a share split or share combination) if Holders of the Debentures participate on the same terms and otherwise on the same basis as holders of Class A Common Stock holding a number of shares equal to the then-current Conversion Rate. 

^^The Company shall not take any action that would result in an adjustment pursuant to the provisions described in this Section 7.08 without complying with NASDAQ Market Rule 5635 (which requires stockholder approval of certain issuances of stock), or any similar rule of any other stock exchange on which the Class A Common Stock may be listed, if applicable. 

^^Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall issue a press release through Business Wire or another widely accepted business wire service containing the relevant information and make this information available on the Company’s website or through another public medium as the Company may use at that time. In addition, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any conversion agent other than the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate setting forth the Conversion Price, detailing the calculation of the Conversion Price and describing the facts upon which the adjustment is based. Unless and until a Trust Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers’ Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Price and may assume that the last Conversion Price of which it has actual knowledge is still in effect. 

^^For purposes of this Section 7.08, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Class A Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Class A Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. 

^^No adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made pursuant to this Section 7.08 if the holders of the Debentures may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to adjustment pursuant to this Section 7.08. 

^Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale. If any of the following events occur, namely: 

^^any reclassification of Class A Common Stock; 

^^any consolidation, merger or binding share exchange involving the Company, or 

^^any sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition to another person of the Company’s property and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, 

in each case, in which the holders of outstanding Class A Common Stock are entitled to receive cash, securities or other property for their shares of Class A Common Stock (any such event or transaction, a “**Reorganization Event**”), then at and after the effective time of such Reorganization Event, the Settlement Amount shall be calculated based on the value of the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that holders of Class A Common Stock immediately prior to such Reorganization Event would been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Reorganization Event (the “**Reference Property**”) as determined by the Board of Directors or the governing body of the entity assuming the obligations hereunder from time to time upon any conversion of the Debentures; *provided*, *however*, in the event the Reorganization Event causes the Common Stock to be converted into, or exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), the amount and kind of Reference Property used to calculate the Settlement Amount shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election; *provided further*, that Section 7.06(d) hereof shall continue to apply following any such transaction. In such event, the Company shall cause notice of the weighted average to be delivered to each Holder, at the address of such Holder as it appears on the Register of the Debentures maintained by the Registrar, as soon as practicable after such determination has been made. 

In addition, in the case of such Reorganization Event, the Company or the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture providing that such Debentures shall, without the consent of any holders of Debentures, be convertible into the cash based on the value of the Reference Property that such Holder would have been entitled to receive upon such Reorganization Event. If, in the case of any such Reorganization Event, the stock or other securities and assets receivable thereupon by a holder of Class A Common Stock includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such Reorganization Event, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Debentures as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent practicable the provisions providing for the conversion rights set forth in this Article 7. 

If the Debentures become convertible into cash based on the value of the Reference Property, the Company shall notify the Trustee and issue a press release containing the relevant information (and make such press release available on the Company’s website). 

Throughout this Article 7, if the Class A Common Stock has been replaced by Reference Property as a result of any transaction described in this Section 7.09, references to Class A Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to such Reference Property. 

The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be delivered to each Holder, at the address of such Holder as it appears on the Register of the Debentures maintained by the Registrar, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture. 

The above provisions of this Section 7.09 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, sales, leases, transfers, conveyances or other dispositions. 

If this Section 7.09 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 7.08 hereof shall not apply. 

The Company may not become party to any such transaction described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 7.09, unless the terms of such transactions are consistent with this Section 7.09. 

^Responsibility of Trustee. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine the Conversion Price or the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Price or Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Class A Common Stock, or of any Capital Stock, other securities or other assets or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Debentures; and the Trustee and any other conversion agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Class A Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Debentures for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article 7. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 7.09 hereof relating either to the kind or amount of shares of capital stock or other securities or other assets or property (including cash) receivable by holders of Debentures upon the conversion of their Debentures after any event referred to in such Section 7.09 hereof or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 7.1 of the Base Indenture, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers’ Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto. 

^Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions. In the case that: 

^^the Company shall declare a dividend or any other distribution on its Class A Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 7.08 or would give rise to a right of the Holders to convert Debentures into cash pursuant to Section 7.03 hereof; or 

^^the Company shall authorize the granting to the holders of all or substantially all of its Class A Common Stock rights or warrants (other than pursuant to a rights plan) to subscribe for or purchase any share of Class A Common Stock; or 

^^of any reclassification or reorganization of the Class A Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Class A Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or 

^^of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company; 

the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be delivered to each Holder at its address appearing on the Register provided for in Section 2.4 of the Base Indenture, as promptly as possible but in any event at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified to the extent the Company has the knowledge to do so, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Class A Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Class A Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Class A Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. 

^Stockholder Rights Plans. If the rights provided for in any rights plan adopted by the Company and in effect upon the conversion of Debentures have separated from the Class A Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights agreement so that the holders of the Debentures would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Debentures, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted at the time of such separation as if the Company distributed to all holders of Class A Common Stock shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of Debt or other assets or property as described in Section 7.08(b) hereof, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. 

\centered **Discharge of Indenture** 

Notwithstanding Article 8 of the Base Indenture, the following Article 8 (and not Article 8 of the Base Indenture) shall apply for purposes of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the Debentures. 

^Discharge of Liability on Debentures. (a) When (i) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Debentures (other than Debentures replaced pursuant to Section 2.8 of the Base Indenture) for cancellation or (ii) all outstanding Debentures have become due and payable, whether at maturity or as a result of the delivery of a notice of redemption or upon a repurchase pursuant to Section 2.10 hereof, and the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption or repurchase all outstanding Debentures, including interest thereon to maturity or such redemption or repurchase date (other than Debentures replaced pursuant to Section 2.8 of the Base Indenture), and any shares of Class A Common Stock or other property due in respect of converted Debentures, and if in each such case the Company pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then this Fourth Supplemental Indenture shall, subject to Section 8.01(b), cease to be of further effect. The Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Company. 

^^Notwithstanding clause (a) above, the Company’s obligations in Sections 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 7.7 and 7.8 of the Base Indenture, in Sections 2.04 and 2.09 hereof and in this Article 8 shall survive until the Debentures have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Company’s obligations in Section 7.7 of the Base Indenture and Sections 8.03 and 8.04 hereof shall survive. 

^Application of Trust Money. The Trustee shall hold in trust money and any shares of Class A Common Stock or other property due in respect of converted Debentures deposited with it pursuant to this Article 8. It shall apply the deposited money through the Paying Agent and in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of and interest on the Debentures or, in the case of any shares of Class A Common Stock or other property due in respect of converted Debentures, in accordance with this Indenture in relation to the conversion of Debentures pursuant to the terms hereof. 

^Repayment to Company. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly turn over to the Company upon request any excess money or securities held by them at any time. 

Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon written request any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest and any shares of Class A Common Stock or other property due in respect of converted Debentures that remains unclaimed for two years, and, thereafter, Debentureholders entitled to the money and/or securities must look to the Company for payment as general creditors. 

^Reinstatement. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or to deliver any shares of Class A Common Stock or other property due in respect of converted Debentures in accordance with this Article 8 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company’s obligations under this Indenture and the Debentures shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article 8 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money and any shares of Class A Common Stock or other property due in respect of converted Debentures in accordance with this Article 8; *provided*, *however*, that, if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Debentures because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Debentureholders of such Debentures to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent. 

^Defeasance. Sections 8.3 and 8.4 of the Base Indenture shall not apply to the Debentures authorized and designated under this Fourth Supplemental Indenture.

\centered [[Percentage 1]]% Senior Cash Convertible Debentures due 2015 

^Interest 

SUNPOWER CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the “Company”), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Debenture at the rate per annum shown above. The Company will pay interest semiannually on [[Date 3]] and [[Date 4]] of each year commencing on [[Date 5]]. Interest on the Debentures will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the Issue Date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. If a payment date is not a Business Day, payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no additional interest will accrue in respect of such payment by virtue of the payment being made on such later date. 

^Method of Payment 

The Company will pay interest on the Debentures (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered holders of Debentures at the close of business on the [[Date 8]] and [[Date 9]] immediately preceding the interest payment date even if Debentures are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. Holders must surrender Debentures to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay principal and interest in money of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. The Company shall pay interest (i) on any Global Debentures by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Depositary or its nominee, (ii) on any Debentures in certificated form having a principal amount of less than $[[USD Value 5]] by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it appears in the Register, *provided, however,* that at maturity interest will be payable at the office of the Company maintained by the Company for such purposes, which shall initially be an office or agency of the Trustee (as defined below) and (iii) on any Debentures in certificated form having a principal amount of $[[USD Value 4]] or more, by wire transfer in immediately available funds at the election of the Holder of such Debentures duly delivered to the Trustee at least five Business Days prior to the relevant interest payment date or by check if no such election is made, *provided, however*, that, at maturity, interest will be payable at the office of the Company maintained by the Company for such purposes, which shall initially be an office or agency of the Trustee. 

If the Company defaults on a payment of interest on the Debentures, the Company will pay the defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest at the rate of [[Percentage 7]]% per annum above the then applicable interest rate from the required payment date to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the Persons who are Debentureholders on a subsequent special record date. The Company will fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and will promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to each Debentureholder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. 

^Paying Agent, Registrar, Service Agent and Conversion Agent 

Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a national banking association (the “Trustee”), will act as Paying Agent, Registrar, Service Agent and Conversion Agent. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar, Service Agent or Conversion Agent without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar, Service Agent or Conversion Agent. 

\centered A-5 

^Indenture 

The Company issued the Debentures under an indenture dated as of [[Date 2]] (the “Base Indenture”), as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of [[Date 1]] (the “Fourth Supplemental Indenture” and together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”), between the Company and the Trustee. The terms of the Debentures include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15. U.S.C. §§ 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the “TIA”). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Debentures are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of those terms. 

The Debentures are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. This Debenture is one of the Debentures referred to in the Indenture issued in an aggregate principal amount of $[[USD Value 1]] (or up to $[[USD Value 2]] if the over-allotment option is exercised in full). The Indenture imposes limitations on the ability of the Company to consolidate or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the property of the Company. 

^Optional Redemption 

The Debentures are not redeemable at the option of the Company. 

^Sinking Fund 

The Debentures are not subject to any sinking fund. 

^Repurchase at Option of Holders Upon a Fundamental Change 

If a Fundamental Change occurs at any time prior to maturity of the Debentures, this Debenture will be subject to a repurchase, at the option of the Holder, on a date (the “Fundamental Change Repurchase Date”), specified by the Company, that is not less than 20 calendar days nor more than 35 calendar days after notice thereof, at a cash repurchase price equal to [[Percentage 8]]% of the principal amount hereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest on this Debenture to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date; *provided, however,* that if such Fundamental Change Repurchase Date falls after a record date and on or prior the corresponding interest payment date, the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date will be paid on such Interest Payment Date to the holder of record of this Debenture on the applicable Record Date instead of the holders surrendering Debentures for repurchase on such date. The Debentures submitted for repurchase must be $[[USD Value 3]] in principal amount or whole multiples thereof. The Company shall deliver to all holders of record of the Debentures a notice of the occurrence of a Fundamental Change and of the repurchase right arising as a result thereof on or before the fifth calendar day after the occurrence of such Fundamental Change. For Debentures to be so repurchased at the option of the Holder, the Holder must deliver to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Repurchase Notice containing the information specified by the Indenture, together with such Debentures, duly endorsed for transfer, or (if the Debentures are Global Debentures) book-entry transfer of the Debentures, prior to 5:00 p.m., [[Address 2: Address]], on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date. The repurchase price must be paid in cash. 

Holders have the right to withdraw any Repurchase Notice by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., [[Address 2: Address]], on the Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as provided in the Indenture. 

If cash sufficient to pay the repurchase price of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all Debentures or portions thereof to be repurchased as of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is deposited with the Paying Agent on the Business Day immediately following the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, then such Debentures will cease to be outstanding and interest will cease to accrue, and the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such other than the right to receive the repurchase price upon delivery or book-entry transfer of such Debentures. 

\centered A-6 

^Conversion 

In compliance with the provisions of the Indenture, as permitted under Section 7.02, 7.03, 7.04 and 7.05 of the Indenture and prior to the close of business on the second Scheduled Trading Day preceding the Maturity Date of this Debenture, the Holder hereof has the right, at its option, to convert each $[[USD Value 3]] principal amount of this Debenture into cash based on the Initial Conversion Price of $22.53 per share of Class A Common Stock (equivalent to the Initial Conversion Rate of approximately [[Shares 1]] shares of Class A Common Stock per $[[USD Value 3]] principal amount of Debentures), subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, as such shares shall be constituted at the date of conversion, upon surrender of this Debenture (if in certificated form) with the form entitled “Cash Conversion Notice” on the reverse hereof duly completed and manually signed, to the Company at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, or at the option of such Holder, the Corporate Trust Office, together with any funds required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, and duly endorsed by, or accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder or by such Holder’s duly authorized attorney. In order to exercise the conversion right with respect to any interest in a Global Debenture, the Holder must complete the appropriate instruction form pursuant to the Depositary’s book-entry conversion program, deliver by book-entry delivery an interest in such Global Debenture, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Company or the Trustee or Conversion Agent, and pay the funds, if any, required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture. 

Prior to the Maturity Date, if and only to the extent holders elect to convert the Debentures in connection with a Non-Stock Change of Control, the Company will increase the Conversion Rate applicable to such converting Debentures as set forth in the Indenture. 

No adjustment in respect of interest on any Debentures converted will be made upon any conversion except as set forth in the next sentence. If this Debenture (or portion hereof) is surrendered for conversion during the period from the 5:00 p.m., [[Address 2: Address]], on any applicable Record Date for the payment of interest to 5:00 p.m., [[Address 2: Address]], on the Business Day preceding the corresponding Interest Payment Date, this Debenture (or portion hereof being converted) must be accompanied by payment, in immediately available funds or other funds acceptable to the Company, of an amount equal to the interest otherwise payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount being converted; *provided*, that no such payment shall be required (1) if the Holder surrenders this Debenture for conversion following the Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date, (2) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, or (3) to the extent of any overdue interest, if overdue interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to this Debenture. 

^Debenture in respect of which a Holder is exercising its right to require repurchase may be converted only if such Holder validly withdraws its election to exercise such right to require repurchase in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. 

^Denominations, Transfer, Exchange 

The Debentures are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $[[USD Value 3]] and whole multiples of $[[USD Value 6]] A Debentureholder may transfer or exchange Debentures in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar or the Company may require a Debentureholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee. Neither the Company, the Trustee nor the Registrar shall be required to exchange, issue or register a transfer of (a) any Debentures or portions thereof surrendered for conversion pursuant to Article 7 of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture and (b) any Debentures or portions thereof tendered for repurchase (and not withdrawn) pursuant to Section 2.10 of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture. 

\centered A-7 

^Persons Deemed Owners 

The registered Holder of this Debenture may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 

^Unclaimed Money 

Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon written request any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest and any shares of Class A Common Stock or other property due in respect of converted Debentures that remains unclaimed for two years, and, thereafter, Debentureholders entitled to the money and/or securities must look to the Company for payment as general creditors. 

^Amendment, Waiver 

Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Debentures may be amended with the written consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures and (ii) any default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the written consent or affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Debentures (i) to provide for conversion rights of Holders and the Company’s repurchase obligations in connection with a Fundamental Change in the event of any reclassification of the Class A Common Stock, merger or consolidation, or sale, conveyance, transfer or lease of the Company’s property and assets substantially as an entirety; (ii) to secure the Debentures; (iii) to provide for the assumption of the Company’s obligations to the Holders of the Debentures in the event of a merger or consolidation, or sale, conveyance, transfer or lease of the Company’s property and assets substantially as an entirety; (iv) to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company in the Indenture; (v) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders; (vi) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, *provided*, *however,* that such modification or amendment does not adversely affect the interests of the Holders in any material respect, *provided*, *further*, that any amendment made solely to conform the provisions of the Indenture or the Debentures to the description of the Debentures contained in the Offering Memorandum shall not be deemed to adversely affect the interests of the Holders; (vii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising under the Base Indenture, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture or the Debentures that the Company may deem necessary or desirable and that shall not be inconsistent with the Base Indenture, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture or the Debentures; *provided*, that such change or modification does not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors, adversely affect the interests of the Holders in any material respect; (viii) to increase the Conversion Rate; (ix) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA; (x) to add guarantees of the obligations under the Debentures; and (xi) to provide for a successor trustee. 

^Defaults and Remedies 

If an Event of Default occurs (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least [[Percentage 9]]% in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Debentures, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare due and payable [[Percentage 8]]% of the principal amount of all outstanding Debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of payment. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs, all unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding Debentures shall become due and immediately payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures may rescind and annul any such acceleration with respect to the Debentures and its consequences. 

\centered A-8 

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Subject to certain exceptions, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Debentures unless (i) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing, (ii) holders of at least [[Percentage 9]]% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy, (iii) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense, (iv) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity and (v) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. Subject to the Indenture, the Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction if the Trustee, in good faith shall, by a Trust Officer of the Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Indenture at the request, order or direction of any Holder pursuant to the provision of the Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby. 

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debenture or of the Indenture shall impair, as among the Company and the Holder of the Debentures, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest or make-whole premium, if any, in respect of the Debenture at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein and in the Indenture prescribed. 

^Trustee Dealings with the Company 

Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Debentures and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 

^No Recourse Against Others 

^director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Debentures or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Debentureholder by accepting a Debenture waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Debentures. 

^Authentication 

This Debenture shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Debenture. 

^Abbreviations 

Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Debentureholder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
