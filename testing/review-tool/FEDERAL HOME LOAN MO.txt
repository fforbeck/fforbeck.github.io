If a principal or interest payment error occurs, Freddie Mac may correct it by adjusting payments to be made on later Interest Payment Dates or Principal Payment Dates (as appropriate) or in any other manner Freddie Mac considers appropriate. If the source of an Index changes in format, but the Calculation Agent determines that the Index source continues to disclose the information necessary to determine the related interest rate substantially as required, the Calculation Agent will amend the procedure for obtaining information from that source to reflect the changed format. All Index values used to determine principal or interest payments are subject to correction within 30 days from the applicable payment. The source of a corrected value must be 

^^^^^ 
the same source from which the original value was obtained. A correction might result in an adjustment on a later date to the amount paid to the Holder. 

^^Payments on Debt Securities shall be rounded, in the case of U.S. dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a Specified Payment Currency other than U.S. dollars, to the nearest smallest transferable unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards). 

^^In the event that any jurisdiction imposes any withholding or other tax on any payment made by Freddie Mac (or our agent or any other person potentially required to withhold) with respect to a Debt Security, Freddie Mac (or our agent or such other person) will deduct the amount required to be withheld from such payment, and Freddie Mac (or our agent or such other person) will not be required to pay additional interest or other amounts, or redeem or repay the Debt Securities prior to the applicable Maturity Date, as a result. 

^^*Fixed Rate Debt Securities*  

Fixed Rate Debt Securities shall bear interest at a single fixed interest rate. The applicable Supplemental Agreement shall specify the fixed interest rate per annum on a Fixed Rate Debt Security. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Supplemental Agreement, interest on a Fixed Rate Debt Security shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. 

^^*Step Debt Securities*  

Step Debt Securities shall bear interest from their Issue Date to a specified date at their initial fixed interest rate and from that date to their Maturity Date at one or more different fixed interest rates that shall be prescribed as of the Issue Date. A Step Debt Security will have one or more step periods. The applicable Supplemental Agreement shall specify the fixed interest rate per annum payable on Step Debt Securities for each related period from issuance to maturity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Supplemental Agreement, interest on a Step Debt Security shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. 

^^^*Variable Rate Debt Securities*  
^Variable Rate Debt Securities shall bear interest at a variable rate determined on the basis of a direct or an inverse relationship to one or more specified Indices or otherwise, (x) plus or minus a Spread, if any, or (y) multiplied by one or more Leverage or Deleverage Factors, if any, as specified in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. Variable Rate Debt Securities also may bear interest in any other manner described in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. 

^Variable Rate Debt Securities may have a Cap and/or a Floor. 

^The applicable Supplemental Agreement shall specify the accrual method (i.e., the day count convention) for calculating interest or any relevant accrual factor on the related Variable Rate Debt Securities. The accrual method may incorporate one or more of the following defined terms: 

**“Actual/360”** shall mean that interest or any other relevant accrual factor shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. 

^^^^^ 
**“Actual/365 (fixed)”** shall mean that interest or any other relevant accrual factor shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365 days, regardless of whether accrual or payment occurs during a calendar leap year. 

**“Actual/Actual”** shall mean, unless otherwise indicated in the applicable Supplemental Agreement, that interest or any other relevant accrual factor shall be calculated on the basis of (x) the actual number of days elapsed in the Interest Payment Period divided by 365, or (y) if any portion of the Interest Payment Period falls in a calendar leap year, (A) the actual number of days in that portion divided by 366 plus (B) the actual number of days in the remaining portion divided by 365. If so indicated in the applicable Supplemental Agreement, “Actual/Actual” shall mean interest or any other relevant accrual factor shall be calculated in accordance with the definition of “Actual/Actual” adopted by the International Securities Market Association (**“Actual/Actual (ISMA)”**), which means a calculation on the basis of the following: 

^where the number of days in the relevant Interest Payment Period is equal to or shorter than the Determination Period during which such Interest Payment Period ends, the number of days in such Interest Payment Period divided by the product of (A) the number of days in such Determination Period and (B) the number of Interest Payment Dates that would occur in one calendar year; or 

^where the Interest Payment Period is longer than the Determination Period during which the Interest Payment Period ends, the sum of (A) the number of days in such Interest Payment Period falling in the Determination Period in which the Interest Payment Period begins divided by the product of (X) the number of days in such Determination Period and (Y) the number of Interest Payment Dates that would occur in one calendar year; and (B) the number of days in such Interest Payment Period falling in the next Determination Period divided by the product of (X) the number of days in such Determination Period and (Y) the number of Interest Payment Dates that would occur in one calendar year. 

^The applicable Supplemental Agreement shall specify the frequency with which the rate of interest on the related Variable Rate Debt Securities shall reset. The applicable Supplemental Agreement also shall specify the Reset Date. If the interest rate will reset within an Interest Payment Period, then the interest rate in effect on the sixth Business Day preceding an Interest Payment Date will be the interest rate for the remainder of that Interest Payment Period and the first day of each Interest Payment Period also will be a Reset Date. Variable Rate Debt Securities may bear interest prior to the initial Reset Date at an initial interest rate, if any, specified in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. If so, then the first day of the first Interest Payment Period will not be a Reset Date. The rate of interest applicable to each Interest Reset Period shall be determined as provided below or in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. 

Except for a Variable Rate Debt Security as to which the rate of interest thereon is determined by reference to LIBOR, EUR-LIBOR, EURIBOR, Prime Rate, Treasury Rate, CMT Rate, CMS Rate, Federal Funds Rate (Daily), or Federal Funds Rate (Weekly Average) or as otherwise set forth in the applicable Supplemental Agreement, the Determination Date for a Variable Rate Debt Security means the second Business Day preceding the Reset Date applicable to an Interest Reset Period. 

^^^^^ 
^If the rate of interest on a Variable Rate Debt Security is subject to adjustment within an Interest Payment Period, accrued interest shall be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of such Variable Rate Debt Security by an accrued interest factor. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Supplemental Agreement, this accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each Interest Reset Period in such Interest Payment Period and rounding the sum to nine decimal places. The interest factor for each such Interest Reset Period shall be computed by (1) multiplying the number of days in the Interest Reset Period by the interest rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such Interest Reset Period; and (2) dividing the product by the number of days in the year referred to in the accrual method specified in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. 

^If and so long as an issue of Variable Rate Debt Securities is admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and such stock exchange so requires, the Calculation Agent shall cause the interest rate for the applicable Interest Reset Period and the amount of interest on the minimum denomination in respect of such issue that would accrue through the last day of such Interest Reset Period, as well as the last day of such Interest Reset Period, to be provided to such stock exchange as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the applicable Reset Date. 

^For each issue of Variable Rate Debt Securities, the Calculation Agent shall also cause the interest rate for the applicable Interest Reset Period and the amount of interest accrued on the minimum denomination specified for such issue to be made available to Holders as soon as practicable after its determination but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter. Such interest amounts so made available may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of adjustment) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the Interest Reset Period. 

^If the applicable Supplemental Agreement specifies LIBOR as the applicable Index for determining the rate of interest for the related Variable Rate Debt Security, the following provisions shall apply (unless otherwise specified in the applicable Supplemental Agreement): 

**“LIBOR”** shall mean, with respect to any Reset Date (in the following order of priority): 

^the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for Deposits in the Index Currency having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated Reuters Page at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such LIBOR Determination Date; 

^if such rate does not so appear pursuant to clause (1) above, the Calculation Agent shall request the principal London offices of four leading banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Freddie Mac, if Freddie Mac is not then acting as Calculation Agent) to provide such banks’ offered quotations (expressed as a percentage per annum) to prime banks in the London interbank market for Deposits in the Index Currency having the Index Maturity at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such LIBOR Determination Date and in a Representative Amount. If at least two quotations 

^^^^^ 
are provided, LIBOR shall be the arithmetic mean (if necessary rounded upwards) of such quotations; 

^if fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested in clause (2) above, the Calculation Agent shall request four major banks in the applicable Principal Financial Center selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Freddie Mac, if Freddie Mac is not then acting as Calculation Agent) to provide such banks’ offered quotations (expressed as a percentage per annum) to leading European banks for a loan in the Index Currency for a period of time corresponding to the Index Maturity, commencing on such Reset Date, at approximately 11:00 a.m. in the Principal Financial Center on such LIBOR Determination Date and in a Representative Amount. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR shall be the arithmetic mean (if necessary rounded upwards) of such quotations; and 

^if fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested in clause (3) above, LIBOR shall be LIBOR determined with respect to the Reset Date immediately preceding such Reset Date or, in the case of the first Reset Date, shall be the rate for Deposits in the Index Currency having the Index Maturity at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the most recent London Banking Day preceding the related LIBOR Determination Date for which such rate shall have been displayed on the Designated Reuters Page with respect to Deposits commencing on the second London Banking Day following such date (or, if the Index Currency is Sterling, commencing on such date). 

^If the applicable Supplemental Agreement specifies EUR-LIBOR as the applicable Index for determining the rate of interest for the related Variable Rate Debt Security, the following provisions shall apply (unless otherwise specified in the applicable Supplemental Agreement): 

**“EUR-LIBOR”** shall mean, with respect to any Reset Date (in the following order of priority): 

^the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for Deposits in euros having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated EUR-LIBOR Reuters Page at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the related EUR-LIBOR Determination Date; 

^if such rate does not so appear pursuant to clause (1) above, the Calculation Agent shall request the principal London offices of four leading banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Freddie Mac, if Freddie Mac is not then acting as Calculation Agent) to provide such banks’ offered quotations (expressed as a percentage per annum) to prime banks in the London interbank market for Deposits in euros having the Index Maturity at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such EUR-LIBOR Determination Date and in a Euro Representative Amount. If at least two quotations are provided, EUR-LIBOR shall be the arithmetic mean (if necessary rounded upwards) of such quotations; 

^^^^^ 
^if fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested in clause (2) above, the Calculation Agent shall request four major banks in London selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Freddie Mac, if Freddie Mac is not then acting as Calculation Agent) to provide such banks’ offered quotations (expressed as a percentage per annum) to leading European banks for a loan in euros for a period of time corresponding to the Index Maturity, commencing on such Reset Date, at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such EUR-LIBOR Determination Date and in a Euro Representative Amount. If at least two such quotations are provided, EUR-LIBOR shall be the arithmetic mean (if necessary rounded upwards) of such quotations; and 

^if fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested in clause (3) above, EUR-LIBOR shall be EUR-LIBOR determined with respect to the Reset Date immediately preceding such Reset Date. If the applicable Reset Date is the first Reset Date, then the rate of interest payable for the new Interest Rate Period will be the initial interest rate. 

^If the applicable Supplemental Agreement specifies EURIBOR as the applicable Index for determining the rate of interest for the related Variable Rate Debt Security, the following provisions shall apply (unless otherwise specified in the applicable Supplemental Statement): 

**“EURIBOR”** shall mean, with respect to a Reset Date (in the following order of priority): 

^the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for Deposits in euros having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated EURIBOR Reuters Page at 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on the relevant EURIBOR Determination Date; 

^if such rate does not so appear pursuant to clause (1) above, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal offices of four major banks in the Euro-Zone selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Freddie Mac, if Freddie Mac is not then acting as Calculation Agent) to provide such banks’ offered quotations (expressed as a percentage per annum) to prime banks in the Euro-Zone interbank market for Deposits in euros having the Index Maturity at 11:00 a.m. Brussels time on such EURIBOR Determination Date and in a Euro Representative Amount. If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR for that date will be the arithmetic mean (if necessary, rounded upwards) of the quotations; 

^if fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested in clause (2) above, EURIBOR for that date will be the arithmetic mean (if necessary, rounded upwards) of the rates quoted by major banks in the Euro-Zone, selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Freddie Mac, if Freddie Mac is not then acting as Calculation Agent), at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on the EURIBOR Determination Date for loans in euros to leading European banks for a period of time corresponding to the Index Maturity and in a Euro Representative Amount. If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR for that date will be the arithmetic mean (if necessary, rounded upwards) of the quotations; and 

^^^^^ 
^if fewer than two quotations are provided as requested in clause (3) above, EURIBOR will be EURIBOR as determined for the immediately preceding Reset Date or, in the case of the first Reset Date, the interest rate payable for the new Interest Reset Period will be the initial interest rate. 

^If the applicable Supplemental Agreement specifies the Prime Rate as the applicable Index for determining the rate of interest for the related Variable Rate Debt Securities, the following provisions shall apply: 

The **“Prime Rate”** means, with respect to any Reset Date (in the following order of priority): 

^the rate for the Prime Rate Determination Date, as published in H.15(519) Daily Update opposite the caption “Bank prime loan”; 

^if the rate is not published by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Reset Date pursuant to clause (1), the rate for the Prime Rate Determination Date as published in H.15(519) opposite the caption “Bank prime loan”; 

^if the rate is not published in either H.15(519) or the H.15 Daily Update by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Reset Date, then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean, determined by the Calculation Agent, of the rates (after eliminating certain rates, as described below in this clause (3)) that appear, at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Prime Rate Determination Date, on Reuters USPRIME1 Page as the U.S. dollar prime rate or base lending rate of each bank appearing on that page; provided, that at least three rates appear. In determining the arithmetic mean: 

^^^if 20 or more rates appear, the highest five rates (or in the event of equality, five of the highest) and the lowest five rates (or in the event of equality, five of the lowest) will be eliminated, 

^^^if fewer than 20 but 10 or more rates appear, the highest two rates (or in the event of equality, two of the highest) and the lowest two rates (or in the event of equality, two of the lowest) will be eliminated, or 

^^^if fewer than 10 but five or more rates appear, the highest rate (or in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest rate (or in the event of equality, one of the lowest) will be eliminated; 

^if fewer than three rates so appear on Reuters USPRIME1 Page pursuant to clause (3) above, then the Calculation Agent will request five major banks in the City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Freddie Mac, if Freddie Mac is not then acting as Calculation Agent) to provide a quotation of such banks’ U.S. dollar prime rates or base lending rates on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on the Prime Rate Determination Date. If at least three quotations are provided, then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean determined by the Calculation Agent of the quotations obtained (and, if five quotations are provided, eliminating 

^^^^^ 
the highest quotation (or in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or in the event of equality, one of the lowest)); 

^if fewer than three quotations are so provided pursuant to clause (4) above, the Calculation Agent will request five banks or trust companies organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state, each having total equity capital of at least U.S. $[[USD Value 3: Number]] and being subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority, selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Freddie Mac, if Freddie Mac is not then acting as Calculation Agent), to provide a quotation of such banks’ or trust companies’ U.S. dollar prime rates or base lending rates on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on the Prime Rate Determination Date. In making such selection of five banks or trust companies, the Calculation Agent will include each bank, if any, that provided a quotation as requested in clause (4) above and exclude each bank that failed to provide a quotation as requested in clause (4). If at least three quotations are provided, then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean determined by the Calculation Agent of the quotations obtained; and 

^if fewer than three quotations are so provided pursuant to clause (5) above, then the Prime Rate will be the Prime Rate determined for the immediately preceding Reset Date. If the applicable Reset Date is the first Reset Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate calculated pursuant to clause (1) or (2) for the most recent New York Banking Day preceding the Reset Date for which such rate was published in H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update. 

^If the applicable Supplemental Agreement specifies the Treasury Rate as the applicable Index for determining the rate of interest for the related Variable Rate, the following provisions shall apply: 

The **“Treasury Rate”** means, with respect to any Reset Date (in the following order of priority): 

^the rate for the Treasury Determination Date of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15 Daily Update under the caption “U.S. government securities/Treasury bills/(secondary market)”; 

^if the rate described in clause (1) above does not appear in H.15 Daily Update by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Reset Date, then the rate for the Treasury Rate Determination Date of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity, as published in the H.15 (519), or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying that rate under the caption “U.S. government securities/Treasury bills(secondary market)”; (3) if the rate described in clause (2) above is not so published by 3.00 p.m., New York City time, on the Reset Date, then the rate from Treasury Auction of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity, as that rate appears under the caption “INVEST RATE” on the display on Reuters USAUCTION10 Page or Reuters USAUCTION11 Page; 

^^^^^ 
^if the rate described in clause (3) above is not published by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Reset Date, then the auction average rate for Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity obtained from the applicable Treasury Auction as announced by the Treasury Department in the form of a press release under the heading “Investment Rate” by 5:00 p.m. on such Reset Date; 

^if the rate describe in clause (4) above is not so announced by the Treasury Department by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Reset Date, then auction average rate obtained from the Treasury Auction of the applicable Treasury Bills, as otherwise announced by the Treasury Department by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Reset Date as determined by the Calculation Agent; 

^if such rate described in clause (5) is not so announced by the Treasury Department by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Reset Date, the Calculation Agent will request five leading primary United States government securities dealers in the City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Freddie Mac, if Freddie Mac is not then acting as Calculation Agent) to provide a quotation of such dealers’ secondary market bid yields, as of 3:00 p.m. on the Reset Date, for Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity (or, in the event that the remaining maturities are equally close, the longer remaining maturity). If at least three quotations are provided, then the Treasury Rate will be the arithmetic mean determined by the Calculation Agent of the quotations obtained; and 

^if fewer than three quotations are so provided pursuant to clause (6) above, then the Treasury Rate for the immediately preceding Reset Date. If the applicable Reset Date is the first Reset Date, then the auction average rate for Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity from the most recent auction of Treasury Bills prior to the Reset Date for which such rate was announced by the Treasury Department in the form of a press release under the heading “Investment Rate.” 

The rate (including the auction average rate) for Treasury Bills and the secondary market bid yield for Treasury Bills will be obtained and expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable (or, if not so expressed, will be converted by the Calculation Agent to such a bond equivalent yield). 

^If the applicable Supplemental Agreement specifies the CMT Rate as the applicable Index for determining the rate of interest for the related Variable Rate, the following provisions shall apply: 

The **“CMT Rate”** means, with respect to any Reset Date (in the following order of priority): 

^for any CMT Determination Date, the daily rate for the Index Maturity that appears on page “FRBCMT” on Reuters (or any other page that replaces the FRBCMT page on that service or any successor service) under the heading “...Treasury Constant Maturities. Federal Reserve Board Release H.15...Mondays Approximately 3:45 p.m.”; 

^^^^^ 
^if the applicable rate described in clause (1) is not displayed on Reuters page FRBCMT at 3:45 p.m., New York City time, on the CMT Determination Date, then the CMT Rate will be the Treasury constant maturity rate for the Index Maturity applicable for the CMT Determination Date as published in H.15 (519); 

^if the CMT Rate is not determined pursuant to clause (1) and the applicable rate described in clause (2) does not appear in H.15 (519) at 3:45 p.m., New York City time, on the CMT Determination Date, then the CMT Rate will be the Treasury constant maturity rate, or other U.S. Treasury rate, applicable to an Index Maturity with reference to the CMT Determination Date, that: 

^^^is published by the Federal Reserve or the Treasury Department; and 

^^^Freddie Mac has determined to be comparable to the applicable rate formerly displayed on Reuters page 7051 and published in H.15 (519); 

^if the CMT Rate is not determined pursuant to clause (1) or (2) and the rate described in clause (3) above does not appear at 3:45 p.m., New York City time, on the CMT Determination Date, then the CMT Rate will be the yield to maturity of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates for U.S. Treasury securities with an original maturity of approximately the Index Maturity and a remaining term to maturity of no more than one year shorter than the Index Maturity, and in a Representative Amount, as of approximately 3:45 p.m., New York City time, on the CMT Determination Date, as quoted by three primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City that Freddie Mac selects. In selecting these offered rates, Freddie Mac will request quotations from five primary dealers and will disregard the highest quotation or, if there is equality, one of the highest and the lowest quotation or, if there is equality, one of the lowest. If two U.S. Treasury securities with an original maturity longer than the Index Maturity have remaining terms to maturity that are equally close to the Index Maturity, Freddie Mac will obtain quotations for the U.S. Treasury security with the shorter remaining term to maturity; 

^if the CMT Rate is not determined pursuant to clause (1), (2) or (3) and fewer than five but more than two primary dealers are quoting offered rates as described in clause (4), then the CMT Rate for the CMT Determination Date will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates so obtained, and neither the highest nor the lowest of those quotations will be disregarded; 

^if the CMT Rate is not determined pursuant to clause (1), (2), (3) or (4) and two or fewer primary dealers are quoting offered rates as described in clause (5), then the CMT Rate will be the yield to maturity of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates for U.S. Treasury securities having an original maturity longer than the Index Maturity and a remaining term to maturity closest to the Index Maturity, and in a Representative Amount, as of approximately 3:45 p.m., New York City time, on the CMT Determination Date, as quoted by three 

^^^^^ 
primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City that Freddie Mac selects. In selecting these offered rates, Freddie Mac will request quotations from five primary dealers and will disregard the highest quotation, or, if there is equality, one of the highest and the lowest quotation or, if there is equality, one of the lowest; 

^if the CMT Rate is not determined pursuant to clauses (1) through (6) above and fewer than five but more than two primary dealers are quoting offered rates as described in clause (6), then the CMT Rate for the CMT Determination date will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates so obtained, and neither the highest nor the lowest of those quotations will be disregarded; and 

^if the Calculation Agent obtains fewer than three quotations of the kind described in clause (6), the CMT Rate in effect for the new Interest Reset Period will be the CMT Rate in effect for the prior Interest Rate Period, or if the applicable Reset Date is the first Reset Date, the rate of interest payable for the new Interest Reset Period will be the initial interest rate. 

^If the applicable Supplemental Agreement specifies the CMS Rate as the applicable Index for determining the rate of interest for the related Variable Rate, the following provisions shall apply: 

The **“CMS Rate”** means, with respect to any Reset Date: 

^the most recent rate for U.S. dollar swap transactions for the applicable Index Currency and applicable Index Maturity, as specified in the applicable Supplemental Agreement for the Debt Securities, expressed as a percentage, which appears on the Reuters page “ISDAFIX1” (or such other page that may replace that page on that service or a successor service) at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the applicable CMS Determination Date; 

^if the most recent CMS Rate as described in clause (1) above was first available prior to ten calendar days before the applicable CMS Determination Date, then the CMS Rate will be determined by the Calculation Agent on the basis of the mid-market semi-annual swap rate quotations provided by the five leading swaps dealers in the New York City interbank market (which may include Dealers and their affiliates), and for this purpose, “mid-market semi-annual swap rate” means the arithmetic mean of the bid and offered rate quotations for the semi-annual fixed leg, calculated on a 30/360 day count basis, of a fixed-for-floating United States dollars denominated interest rate swap transaction with the applicable Index Currency and Index Maturity, as specified in the applicable Supplemental Agreement for the Debt Securities, commencing on the Reset Date for the relevant Interest Period, and for a relevant representative amount in the relevant market at the relevant time, with an acknowledged dealer of good credit in the swap market, where the floating leg, calculated on an Actual/360 day count basis, is equivalent to USD-LIBOR-BBA (as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, 

^^^^^ 
Inc.) with a designated maturity of three months. The Calculation Agent will request the principal New York City office of each of the five leading swaps dealers selected by the Calculation Agent to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least five quotations are provided, the rate for that CMS Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations, eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest); 

^if two, three or four (and not five) of such swaps dealers are quoting as described in clause (2) above, then the CMS Rate will be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations will be eliminated; and 

^if fewer than two rate quotations are provided, then the CMS Rate for the Reset Date will be the CMS Rate in effect on the preceding Reset Date, or if the applicable Reset Date is the first Reset Date, the rate of interest payable for the new Interest Reset Period will be the initial interest rate. 

^If the applicable Supplemental Agreement specifies the Federal Funds Rate (Daily) as the applicable Index for determining the rate of interest for the related Variable Rate, the following provisions shall apply: 

The **“Federal Funds Rate (Daily)”** means, with respect to any Reset Date: 

^the rate for the Business Day preceding the Federal Funds Rate (Daily) Determination Date for U.S. dollar federal funds, as published in the latest H.15Daily Update opposite the caption “Federal funds (effective)”; 

^if the rate specified in clause (1) is not published by 5:00 p.m., New York City Time, on the Federal Funds Rate (Daily) Determination Date, the Federal Funds Rate (Daily) will be the rate for that Fed Funds Rate (Daily) Determination Date as published in the H.15 Daily Update, or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, opposite the caption “Federal funds (effective)”; 

^if the rate specified in clause (2) is not published by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Federal Funds Rate Determination Date, then the Calculation Agent will request five leading brokers (which may include the related Dealers or their affiliates) of federal funds transactions in the City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Freddie Mac, if Freddie Mac is not then acting as Calculation Agent) each to provide a quotation of the broker’s effective rate for transactions in overnight federal funds arranged by the broker settling on the Business Day preceding the Federal Funds Rate (Daily) Determination Date. If at least two quotations are provided, then the Federal Funds Rate (Daily) will be the arithmetic mean determined by the Calculation Agent of the quotations obtained (and, if five quotations are provided, eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)); 

^^^^^ 
^if fewer than two quotations are so provided pursuant to clause (3) above, then the Calculation Agent will request five leading brokers (which may include the related Dealers or their affiliates) of federal funds transactions in the City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Freddie Mac, if Freddie Mac is not then acting as Calculation Agent) each to provide a quotation of the broker’s rates for the last transaction in overnight federal funds arranged by the broker as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day preceding the Federal Funds Rate (Daily) Determination Date. If at least two quotations are provided, then the Federal Funds Rate (Daily) will be the arithmetic mean determined by the Calculation Agent of the quotations obtained (and, if five quotations are provided, eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)); and 

^if fewer than two quotations are so provided pursuant to clause (4) above, then the Federal Funds Rate (Daily) as of such Federal Funds Rate (Daily) Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate (Daily) determined for the immediately preceding Reset Date. If the applicable Reset Date is the first Reset Date, then the rate of interest payable for the new Interest Rate Period will be the initial interest rate. 

^If the applicable Supplemental Agreement specifies the Federal Funds Rate (Weekly Average) as the applicable Index for determining the rate of interest for the related Variable Rate, the following provisions shall apply: 

The **“Federal Funds Rate (Weekly Average)”** means, with respect to any Reset Date:

Freddie Mac, its agent or any other person potentially required to withhold with respect to payments on a Debt Security shall have the right to require a Holder of a Debt Security, as a condition to payment of principal of or interest on such Debt Security, or as a condition to transfer or exchange of such Debt Security, to present at such place as Freddie Mac, its agent or such other person shall designate a certificate in such form as Freddie Mac, its agent or such other person may from time to time prescribe, to enable Freddie Mac, its agent or such other person to determine its duties and liabilities with respect to (i) any taxes, assessments or governmental charges which Freddie Mac, any Federal Reserve Bank, the Global Agent or such other person, as the case may be, may be required to deduct or withhold from payments in respect of such Debt Security under any present or future law of the United States or jurisdiction therein or any regulation or interpretation of any taxing authority thereof; and (ii) any reporting or other requirements under such laws, regulations or interpretations. Freddie Mac, its agent or such other person shall be entitled to determine its duties and liabilities with respect to such deduction, withholding, reporting or other requirements on the basis of information contained in such certificate or, if no certificate shall be presented, on the basis of any presumption created by 

^^^^^ 
any such law, regulation or interpretation, and shall be entitled to act in accordance with such determination. 

Section 8.05. Amendment.  

^^Freddie Mac may modify, amend or supplement this Agreement and the terms of an issue of Debt Securities, without the consent of the Holders or Beneficial Owners, (i) to cure any ambiguity, or to correct or supplement any defective provision or to make any other provision with respect to matters or questions arising under this Agreement or the terms of any Debt Security that are not inconsistent with any other provision of this Agreement or the Debt Security; (ii) to add to the covenants of Freddie Mac for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon Freddie Mac; (iii) to evidence the succession of another entity to Freddie Mac and its assumption of the covenants of Freddie Mac; (iv) to conform the terms of an issue of Debt Securities or cure any ambiguity or discrepancy resulting from any changes in the Book-Entry Rules or any regulation or document that are applicable to book-entry securities of Freddie Mac; (v) to increase the amount of an issue of Debt Securities as contemplated under Section 2.07; or (vi) in any other manner that Freddie Mac may determine and that will not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of Holders or Beneficial Owners at the time of such modification, amendment or supplement. 

^^In addition, either (i) with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the aggregate then outstanding principal amount or notional principal amount of an issue of Debt Securities affected thereby, excluding any such Debt Securities owned by Freddie Mac; or (ii) by the adoption of a resolution at a meeting of Holders at which a quorum is present, by the Holders of at least a majority of the aggregate then outstanding principal amount or notional principal amount of an issue of Debt Securities represented at such meeting, excluding any such Debt Securities owned by Freddie Mac, Freddie Mac may from time to time and at any time modify, amend or supplement the terms of an issue of Debt Securities for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any provisions of such Debt Securities or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders; provided, however, that no such modification, amendment or supplement may, without the written consent or affirmative vote of each Holder of a Debt Security; (A) change the Maturity Date or any Interest Payment Date of such Debt Security; (B) materially modify the redemption or repayment provisions, if any, relating to the redemption or repayment price of, or any redemption or repayment date or period for, such Debt Security; (C) reduce the principal amount of, delay the principal payment of, or materially modify the rate of interest or the calculation of the rate of interest on, such Debt Security; (D) in the case of Registered Debt Securities only, change the Specified Payment Currency of such Registered Debt Security; or (E) reduce the percentage of Holders whose consent or affirmative vote is necessary to modify, amend or supplement the terms of the relevant issue of Debt Securities. A quorum at any meeting of Holders called to adopt a resolution shall be Holders entitled to vote a majority of the then aggregate outstanding principal amount or notional principal amount of an issue of such Debt Securities called to such meeting and, at any reconvened meeting adjourned for lack of a quorum, [[Percentage 2]]% of the then aggregate outstanding principal amount or notional principal amount of such issue of Debt Securities, in both cases excluding any such Debt Securities owned by Freddie Mac. It shall not be necessary for the Holders to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent or resolution approves the substance of such change. If any modification, amendment or supplement of the terms of an issue of Debt Securities that have 

^^^^^ 
been separated into Interest and Principal Components requires the consent of Holders, only the Holders of the Principal Components will be entitled to give or withhold that consent. Holders of Interest Components will have no right to give or withhold such consent. 

^^The “principal amount,” for purposes of the preceding paragraph, for a Debt Security that is a Zero Coupon Debt Security or for a Debt Security issued at an “issue price” of [[Percentage 4: Number]]% or less of its principal amount will be equal to (i) the issue price of such Debt Security; plus (ii) the original issue discount that has accrued from the Issue Date of such Debt Security to the OID Determination Date; minus (iii) any amount considered as part of the “stated redemption price at maturity” of such Debt Security that has been paid from the Issue Date of such Debt Security to the OID Determination Date. 

The “principal amount,” for purposes of the second preceding paragraph, of a Debt Security whose Specified Principal Currency is other than U.S. dollars will be the U.S. dollar equivalent, determined on the Issue Date, of the principal amount (or, in the case of the Debt Securities referred to in the preceding paragraph, the amount determined in accordance with the provisions described in such preceding paragraph) of such Debt Security. The “principal amount” of a Debt Security with principal determined by reference to an Index will be described in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. 

^^Freddie Mac may establish a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to vote at any meeting of Holders of Debt Securities, to grant any consent in respect of Debt Securities and to notice with respect to any such meeting or consent. 

^^Any instrument given by or on behalf of any Holder of a Debt Security in connection with any consent to any such modification, amendment or supplement shall be irrevocable once given and shall be conclusive and binding on all subsequent Holders of such Debt Security or any Debt Security issued, directly or indirectly, in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not notation in regard thereto is made thereon. Any modification, amendment or supplement of this Agreement or of the terms of Debt Securities shall be conclusive and binding on all Holders of Debt Securities affected thereby, whether or not they have given such consent or were present at any meeting (unless by the terms of this Agreement a written consent or an affirmative vote of such Holders is required), and whether or not notation of such modification, amendment or supplement is made upon the Debt Securities. 

Section 8.06. Securities Acquired by Freddie Mac. 

Freddie Mac may, from time to time, repurchase or otherwise acquire (either for cash or in exchange for newly-issued Debt Securities) all or a portion of any issue of Debt Securities. Any Debt Securities owned by Freddie Mac shall have an equal and proportionate benefit under the provisions of this Agreement, without preference, priority or distinction as among such Debt Securities, except that in determining whether the Holders of the required percentage of the outstanding principal amount (or notional principal amount) of an issue of Debt Securities have given any required demand, authorization, notice, consent or waiver under this Agreement, any Debt Securities owned by Freddie Mac or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with Freddie Mac shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of such determination. 

Section 8.07. Notice.  

^^^^^ 
^^Any notice, demand or other communication which by any provision of this Agreement is required or permitted to be given to or served upon any Holder may be given or served in writing by deposit thereof, postage prepaid, in the mail, addressed to such Holder as such Holder’s name and address may appear in the records of Freddie Mac, a Federal Reserve Bank or the Registrar, as the case may be, or, in the case of a Holder of a Fed Book-Entry Debt Security, by transmission to such Holder through the communication system linking the Federal Reserve Banks. Such notice, demand or other communication to or upon any Holder shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given or made, for all purposes, upon mailing or transmission.

Notice by publication shall be deemed to have been given on the date of publication or, if published more than once, on the date of first publication.
