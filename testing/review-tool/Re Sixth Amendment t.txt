Ladies and Gentlemen:  
This letter constitutes a Sixth Amendment (“Amendment”) to the Agreement referenced above. Capitalized terms used in this Amendment and not otherwise defined shall be used as defined in the Agreement.

^Galileo and Orbitz Funding of Orbitz Marketing Programs.

^Marketing Program. From time to time during the Term of the Agreement, Galileo and Orbitz may agree to contribute money toward a marketing program to be conducted by Orbitz (each, a “**Marketing Program**”) pursuant to the terms of this Amendment. The goals of such Marketing Programs shall be to generate bookings through Orbitz.com and to generate Segments on one or more Travelport GDS or as otherwise mutually agreed between the parties. In connection with each Marketing Program, Galileo and Orbitz shall enter into a Summary of Marketing Program Terms, substantially in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit A**.

^Initial Marketing Program. Galileo and Orbitz agree to fund, and Orbitz agrees to conduct, the following initial Marketing Program (“**Initial Marketing Program**”):

^Funding. Galileo and Orbitz shall fund the Initial Marketing Program, with the amount of each Party’s contribution to be up to the Galileo Marketing Contribution Cap and Orbitz Marketing Contribution Cap, respectively. Orbitz shall run online marketing campaigns (each, a “**Marketing Campaign**”), with the timing and nature of each Marketing Campaign to be determined by Orbitz after reasonable consultation with Galileo. The parties will evaluate the results of each Marketing Campaign, and each party shall determine in its sole discretion after such evaluation whether or not to contribute additional money to the Initial Marketing Program for additional Marketing Campaigns. The Marketing Campaigns may include (without limitation) paid advertisements on travel research websites (for example, Travelzoo.com) or paid search marketing on search engines (for example, Google). If the Total Marketing Dollars are not expended during the Marketing Campaign, any unused amounts will be returned to the parties in proportion to each party’s contribution.

^Other Terms. Provided that the parties agree on the amounts of the Orbitz Marketing Contribution and Galileo Marketing Contribution on a timely basis, Orbitz shall use commercially reasonable efforts to spend the Total Marketing Dollars on Marketing Campaigns that will run by [[Date 3: Date]]. In connection with each Marketing Campaign, Orbitz shall provide Galileo with (i) a summary of the payments made under the Marketing Campaign, and (ii) Orbitz’s best estimate of the number of Segments booked as a result of the Marketing Campaign (delineated by Travelport GDS and, to the extent practicable, identifying the number of Segments generated during the Marketing Campaign that are incremental in nature).

^General. This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties hereto or their successors in interest, except as expressly provided in the Agreement. Each Party to this Amendment agrees that, other than as expressly set out in this Amendment, nothing in this Amendment is intended to alter the rights, duties and obligations of the Parties under the Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect as amended hereby. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Amendment and the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Amendment shall govern. This Amendment may be executed by the Parties in separate counterparts and each counterpart shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

^^^^^ 
The Parties have caused this Amendment to be executed by the signatures of their respective authorized representatives.
