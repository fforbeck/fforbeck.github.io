beginning on [[Date 14: Date]], on each Conversion Date (as to that principal amount then being converted) and on the Maturity Date.

Section 3.  Registration of Transfers and Exchanges. 

^^Different Denominations. This Debenture is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Debentures of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge will be payable for such registration of transfer or exchange.

This Debenture has been issued subject to certain investment representations of the original Holder set forth in the Purchase Agreement and may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Purchase Agreement and applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations. 

^^Reliance on Debenture Register.

Section 4.  Conversion.  

^^Voluntary Conversion. At any time after the Original Issue Date until this Debenture is no longer outstanding, this Debenture shall be convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock at the option of the Holder, at any time and from time to time. The Holder shall effect conversions by delivering to the Company a Notice of Conversion, the form of which is attached hereto as Annex A (each, a “Notice of Conversion”), specifying therein the principal amount of this Debenture to be converted and the date on which such conversion shall 

^^^^^ 
be effected (such date, the “Conversion Date”). If no Conversion Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion, the Conversion Date shall be the date that such Notice of Conversion is deemed delivered hereunder. Conversions hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding principal amount of this Debenture in an amount equal to the applicable amount being converted. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the principal amount(s) converted and the date of such conversion(s). The Company may deliver an objection to any Notice of Conversion within three Business Days of delivery of such Notice of Conversion. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, the records of the Company shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error. **The Holder, and any assignee by acceptance of this Debenture, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Debenture, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Debenture may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.** 

^^Conversion Price. The conversion price in effect on any Conversion Date shall be equal to **$[[USD Value 3]],** subject to adjustment herein (the “Conversion Price”). 

^^Mechanics of Conversion.  

^^^Conversion Shares Issuable Upon Conversion of Principal Amount. The number of Conversion Shares issuable upon a conversion hereunder shall be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the outstanding principal amount of this Debenture to be converted by (y) the Conversion Price. 

^^^Delivery of Certificate Upon Conversion. Not later than five Trading Days after each Conversion Date, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of this Debenture. 

^^^Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of this Debenture as herein provided, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Debentures), not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement) be issuable (taking into account the adjustments of Section 5) upon the conversion of the then outstanding principal amount of this Debenture. The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

^^^Fractional Shares. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of this Debenture. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon 

^^^^^ 
such conversion, the Company shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. 

^^Transfer Taxes. The issuance of certificates for shares of the Common Stock on conversion of this Debenture shall be made without charge to the Holder hereof for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such certificates; provided, however, that, the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holder and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. 

Section 5.  Certain Adjustments.  

^^Stock Dividends and Stock Splits. If the Company, at any time while this Debenture is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 5(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. 

^^Subsequent Equity Sales. Other than in respect of an Exempt Issuance, if, at any time while this Debenture is outstanding, the Company sells any shares of Common Stock or sells any option or right entitling any Person to acquire shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the then Conversion Price (such lower price, the “Base Conversion Price”), then the Conversion Price shall be reduced to equal the Base Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5(b), in no event shall the Conversion Price be reduced to less than $[[USD Value 5: Number]] (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5(a)) as a result of any adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 5(b). 

^^Calculations. All calculations under this Section 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 5, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date 

^^^^^ 
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) issued and outstanding. 

^^Notice to the Holder of Adjustment to Conversion Price. Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 5, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Holder a notice setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

Section 6.  

^^Optional Redemption at Election of Company. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6(a), at any time after Original Issue Date, the Company may deliver a notice to the Holder (an “Optional Redemption Notice” and the date such notice is deemed delivered hereunder, the “Optional Redemption Notice Date”) of the Company’s election to redeem all of the then outstanding principal amount of this Debenture for cash in an amount equal to the then outstanding principal amount of this Debenture plus accrued and unpaid interest hereon (the “Optional Redemption Amount”) on the 10th Trading Day following the Optional Redemption Notice Date (such date, the “Optional Redemption Date”, such 10 Trading Day period, the “Optional Redemption Period” and such redemption, the “Optional Redemption”). The Optional Redemption Amount shall be paid in full on the Optional Redemption Date. The Company may only effect an Optional Redemption if each of the Equity Conditions shall have been met (unless waived in writing by the Holder) on each Trading Day during the period commencing on the Optional Redemption Notice Date through the Optional Redemption Date. If any of the Equity Conditions shall cease to be satisfied at any time during the Optional Redemption Period, then the Holder may elect to nullify the Optional Redemption Notice by notice to the Company within one Trading Day after the first day on which any such Equity Condition has not been met in which case the Optional Redemption Notice shall be null and void, *ab initio*. The Company covenants and agrees that it will honor all Notices of Conversion tendered from the time of delivery of the Optional Redemption Notice through the date all amounts owing thereon are due and paid in full. The Company’s determination to pay an Optional Redemption in cash shall be applied ratably to all of the holders of the then outstanding Debentures based on their (or their predecessor’s) initial purchases of Debentures pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. 

^^Redemption Procedure. If any portion of the payment pursuant to an Optional Redemption shall not be paid by the Company by the applicable due date, interest shall accrue thereon at an interest rate equal to the lesser of [[Percentage 7: Number]]% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until such amount is paid in full. The Holder may elect to convert the outstanding principal amount of this Debenture pursuant to Section 4 prior to actual payment in cash for any redemption under this Section 6 by the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the Company. 

Section 7.  Negative Covenants. As long as any portion of this Debenture remains outstanding, unless the holders of at least a majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding Debentures shall have otherwise given prior written consent, on or after the Original Issue Date, the Company shall not (i) pay cash dividends or distributions on any equity securities 

^^^^^ 
of the Company or (ii) other than Permitted Indebtedness, incur any indebtedness for borrowed money of any kind. 

Section 8.  Mandatory Redemption. If any Mandatory Redemption Event occurs and remains in effect for 10 consecutive Trading Days, at the Holder’s election as evidenced by written notice to the Company, the Mandatory Default Amount shall be immediately due and payable in cash to the Holder. Upon the payment in full of the Mandatory Default Amount, the Holder shall promptly surrender this Debenture to or as directed by the Company. 

Section 9.  Miscellaneous.
