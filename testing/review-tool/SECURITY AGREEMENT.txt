^^the Administrative Agent may obtain insurance for the Collateral at any time when any Obligor has failed to do so, and the Obligors shall promptly pay, or reimburse the Administrative Agent for, all expenses incurred in connection therewith;

^^the Administrative Agent may make any reasonable compromise or settlement deemed desirable with respect to any of the Collateral and may extend the time of payment, arrange for payment in installments, or otherwise modify the terms of, any of the Collateral;

^^the Administrative Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (whether or not said Code is in effect in the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted) and such additional rights and remedies to which a secured party is entitled under the laws in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted, including, without limitation, the right, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to exercise all voting, consensual and other powers of ownership pertaining to the Collateral as if the Administrative Agent were the sole and absolute owner thereof (and each Obligor agrees to take all such action as may be appropriate to give effect to such right);

^^the Administrative Agent in its discretion may, in its name or in the name of the Obligors or otherwise, demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or property at any time payable or receivable on account of or in exchange for any of the Collateral, but shall be under no obligation to do so; and

^^the Administrative Agent may, upon ten Business Days' prior written notice to the Obligors of the time and place, with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof that shall then be or shall thereafter come into the possession, custody or control of the Administrative Agent, the other Secured Creditors or any of their respective agents, sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such Collateral, at such place or places as the Administrative Agent deems best, and for cash or for credit or for future delivery (without thereby assuming any credit risk), at public or private sale, without demand of performance or notice of intention to effect any such disposition or of the time or place thereof (except such notice as is required above or by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Creditor or anyone else may be the purchaser, lessee, assignee or recipient of any or all of the Collateral so disposed of at any public sale (or, to the extent permitted by law, at any private sale) and thereafter hold the same absolutely, free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any right or equity of redemption (statutory or otherwise), of the Obligors, any such demand, notice and right or equity being hereby expressly waived and released. In the event of any sale, assignment, or other disposition of any of the Trademark Collateral, the goodwill connected with and symbolized by the Trademark Collateral subject to such disposition shall be included, and the Obligors shall supply to the Administrative Agent or its designee, for inclusion in such sale, assignment or other disposition, all Intellectual Property relating to such Trademark Collateral. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and such sale may be made at any time or place to which the sale may be so adjourned.

The Proceeds of each collection, sale or other disposition under this Section 5.5, including by virtue of the exercise of the license granted to the Administrative Agent in Section 5.4(b), shall be applied in accordance with Section 5.9.

The Obligors recognize that, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws, the Administrative Agent may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Collateral, to limit purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire the Collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. The Obligors acknowledge that any such private sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the Administrative Agent than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions, and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agree that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the respective Issuer or issuer thereof to register it for public sale.

^^**Deficiency**.

If the proceeds of sale, collection or other realization of or upon the Collateral pursuant to Section 5.5 are insufficient to cover the costs and expenses of such realization and the payment in full of the Secured Obligations, the Obligors shall remain liable for any deficiency to the extent the Obligors are obligated under this Agreement.

^^**Locations, Etc**.

Without at least 25 days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, no Obligor shall change its location (as defined in Section 9-307 of the Uniform Commercial Code) or change its name from the name shown as its current legal name on **Schedule 2**.

^^**Private Sale**.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Creditor shall incur any liability as a result of the sale of the Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private sale pursuant to Section 5.5 conducted in a commercially reasonable manner. Each Obligor hereby waives any claims against the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Creditor arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations, even if the Administrative Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree.

^^**Application of Proceeds**.

The proceeds of any collection, sale or other realization of all or any part of the Collateral pursuant hereto, and any other cash at the time held by the Administrative Agent under this Section 5, shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as expressly provided in the Credit Agreement.

^^**Attorney in Fact**.

Without limiting any rights or powers granted by this Agreement to the Administrative Agent while no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default the Administrative Agent is hereby appointed the attorney in fact of each Obligor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Section 5 and taking any action and executing any instruments that the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment as attorney in fact is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at such times as the Administrative Agent shall be entitled under this Section 5 to make collections in respect of the Collateral, the Administrative Agent shall have the right and power to receive, endorse and collect all checks made payable to the order of any Obligor representing any dividend, payment or other distribution in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof and to give full discharge for the same.

^^**Perfection**.

Prior to or concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Obligor shall (i) file such financing statements and other documents in such offices as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to perfect the security interests granted by Section 3 of this Agreement, (ii) deliver to the Administrative Agent all certificates identified in **Schedule 3**, accompanied by undated stock powers duly executed in blank and (iii) execute and deliver such IP Security Agreements relating to Collateral consisting of the Patent Collateral, Copyright Collateral and Trademark Collateral as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request. Without limiting the foregoing, each Obligor consents that Uniform Commercial Code financing statements may be filed by the Administrative Agent describing the Collateral as “all assets” or “all personal property” (or any other words of similar effect) of such Obligor.

^^**Termination**.

When all Secured Obligations shall have been paid in full in cash and the Commitments under the Credit Agreement shall have terminated, this Agreement shall terminate, and the Administrative Agent shall forthwith cause to be assigned, transferred and delivered, against receipt but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, any remaining Collateral and money received in respect thereof, to or on the order of the respective Obligor and to be released and canceled all licenses and rights referred to in Section 5.4(b). The Administrative Agent shall also execute and deliver to the respective Obligor upon such termination such Uniform Commercial Code termination statements, certificates for terminating the Liens on the Motor Vehicles and such other documentation as shall be reasonably requested by the respective Obligor to effect the termination and release of the Liens on the Collateral. The Administrative Agent shall release its Liens on certain assets sold or disposed of by the Obligors in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.12(e) of the Credit Agreement.

^^**Further Assurances**.

Each Obligor agrees that, from time to time upon the reasonable written request of the Administrative Agent, such Obligor will execute and deliver such further documents and do such other acts and things as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in order fully to effect the purposes of this Agreement, including with respect to Section 5.4(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Obligor shall be required to take any action to record or perfect the Administrative Agent’s security interest in or Lien on any Intellectual Property except under United States law.

In the event that at any time after the Closing Date, any Obligor or any Domestic Subsidiary owns or holds an interest in any Real Property, assets, stock, securities or any other property or interest which is not at the time included collateral pledged pursuant to this Agreement or any other Security Document (all of the foregoing, “**Uncollateralized Property**”), such Obligor will or will cause such Domestic Subsidiary to, promptly (or, in the case of any such Uncollateralized Property acquired in connection with a Permitted Acquisition, concurrently with the consummation thereof), grant the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors security interests and mortgages or deeds of trust, pursuant to this Agreement or other new documentation or joinder in any existing Security Document to which it is not already a party (all in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), in all of the Uncollateralized Property.

Each Obligor will execute any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such further actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements, fixture filings, mortgages, deeds of trust and other documents), which may be required under any applicable law, or which the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, so as at all times to maintain the validity, perfection, enforceability and priority of the Administrative Agent’s security interest in the Collateral or to enable the Administrative Agent to protect, exercise or enforce its rights hereunder and the Administrative Agent’s rights in the Collateral. Each Obligor also agrees to provide (or cause to be provided) to the Administrative Agent, from time to time upon request, evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as to the perfection and priority of the Liens created or intended to be created by the Security Documents. In addition, each Obligor shall, when and as often as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, furnish to the Administrative Agent, statements and schedules further identifying and describing the Collateral and such other reports in connection with the Collateral as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, all in reasonable detail.

The Administrative Agent is authorized to (i) enter into any modification of any Security Document which the Administrative Agent reasonably believes is required to conform to the mandatory requirements of local law, or to local customs followed by financial institutions with respect to similar collateral documents involving property located in any particular jurisdiction, (ii) in the case of any Security Document relating to property located in a particular jurisdiction which imposes a tax with respect to such Security Document based on the amount of the obligations secured thereby, expressly limit the amount of such secured obligations which are secured by such property to such amount as, in the Administrative Agent’s good faith judgment, is appropriate so that the amount of such tax is reasonable in light of the estimated value of the property located in such jurisdiction, and/or (iii) designate the amount of title insurance coverage for any title insurance policy provided hereunder in an amount reasonably believed by the Administrative Agent to be representative of the fair value of the property covered thereby.

^**Miscellaneous**.

^^**Notices**.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telegraphic, facsimile transmission or e-mail transmission) and mailed, telegraphed, transmitted, or delivered, if to the Borrower, Holdings or the Administrative Agent, at the address provided for in the Credit Agreement; if to any Subsidiary Guarantor, at the address listed below such Subsidiary Guarantor’s signature to this Agreement; or at such other applicable address as shall be designated by any party in a written notice to the other parties hereto from time to time. All such notices and communications shall be mailed, telegraphed, telecopied, transmitted or sent by overnight courier, and shall be effective when received.

^^**No Waiver**.

No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Creditor to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Creditor of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

^^**Amendments**.

The terms of this Agreement may be waived, altered or amended only by an instrument in writing duly executed by each Obligor and the Administrative Agent. Any such amendment or waiver shall be binding upon the Administrative Agent and each Obligor.

^^**Supplemental Disclosure**.

From time to time as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent (but while no Event of Default is continuing, not more than once per fiscal quarter of Holdings) or at the Obligors’ election, the Obligors shall supplement each Schedule hereto, or the exceptions to any representation herein, with respect to any matter hereafter arising that, if existing or occurring at the Closing Date, would have been required to be set forth or described in such Schedule or as such an exception to a representation or that is necessary to correct or supplement any information in such Schedule or representation which has been rendered inaccurate thereby (and, in the case of any supplements to any Schedule, such supplemental Schedule shall be appropriately marked to show the changes made therein); **provided** that no such supplement to any such Schedule or exception to any such representation shall be or be deemed to be a waiver of any then-existing Default or Event of Default resulting from the matters disclosed therein (before giving effect to such supplement).

^^**Expenses**.

The Obligors jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Secured Creditors for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by them (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of any individual primary outside counsel to the Administrative Agent plus one additional local counsel in each local jurisdiction as may be appropriate) in connection with (i) any Default and any enforcement or collection proceeding resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, all manner of participation in or other involvement with (w) performance by the Administrative Agent of any obligations of the Obligors in respect of the Collateral that the Obligors have failed or refused to perform, (x) bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, foreclosure, winding up or liquidation proceedings, or any actual or attempted sale, or any exchange, enforcement, collection, compromise or settlement in respect of any of the Collateral, and for the care of the Collateral and defending or asserting rights and claims of the Administrative Agent in respect thereof, by litigation or otherwise, including expenses of insurance, (y) judicial or regulatory proceedings and (z) workout, restructuring or other negotiations or proceedings (whether or not the workout, restructuring or transaction contemplated thereby is consummated); provided that Secured Creditors who are not acting in the capacity as the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled for reimbursement for no more than one counsel representing all such Secured Creditors (absent a conflict of interest in which case the Secured Creditors may engage and be reimbursed for additional counsel) and (ii) the enforcement of this Section 6.5, and all such costs and expenses shall be Secured Obligations entitled to the benefits of the collateral security provided pursuant to Section 3.

^^**Successors and Assigns**.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of each Obligor and the Administrative Agent (**provided, however**, that no Obligor shall assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent).

^^**Counterparts**.

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.

^^**Governing Law**.

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York without regards to the conflict of laws principles thereof (other than Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law).

^^**Agents and Attorneys in Fact**.

The Administrative Agent may employ agents and attorneys in fact in connection herewith and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys in fact selected by it in good faith.

^^**Captions**.

The captions and section headings appearing herein are included solely for convenience of reference and are not intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

^^**Severability**.

If any provision hereof is invalid and unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (a) the other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction and shall be liberally construed in favor of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Creditors in order to carry out the intentions of the parties hereto as nearly as may be possible and (b) the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

^^**Additional Subsidiary Guarantors**.

Each new Subsidiary of the Borrower or Holdings that is required pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.9 of the Credit Agreement to become a party to this Agreement as a Subsidiary Guarantor shall do so by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a Joinder in the form of **Exhibit A** hereto and delivering the same along with new versions of the Schedules to this Agreement. Upon the delivery of all such documents and the acceptance thereof by the Administrative Agent, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to incorporate such new Subsidiary Guarantor and such new Schedules.

^^**Mortgages**.

In the event that any of the Collateral hereunder is also subject to a valid and enforceable Lien under the terms of any Mortgage and the terms of such Mortgage are inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, then with respect to such Collateral, the terms of such Mortgage shall be controlling in the case of fixtures and real estate leases, letting and licenses of, and contracts and agreements relating to the lease of, real property, and the terms of this Agreement shall be controlling in the case of all other Collateral.

^^**Limitations on Duties of Administrative Agent**.

The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent under this Agreement are solely to protect the Administrative Agent’s interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. The Administrative Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers and neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to Obligors for any act or failure to act, except to the extent constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that which the Administrative Agent, in its individual capacity, accords its own property consisting of the type of Collateral involved, it being understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility for taking any necessary steps (other than steps taken in accordance with the standard of care set forth above) to preserve rights against any Person with respect to any Collateral.

Also without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not have any obligation or liability under any contract or license by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the granting to the Administrative Agent of a security interest therein or assignment thereof or the receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment relating to any contract or license pursuant hereto, nor shall the Administrative Agent be required or obligated in any manner to perform or fulfill any of the obligations of Obligors under or pursuant to any contract or license, or to make any payment, or to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or the sufficiency of any performance by any party under any contract or license, or to present or file any claim, or to take any action to collect or enforce any performance or the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.
