Each Grantor will cause to be taken all necessary steps in any proceeding before the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office or any similar office or agency in any other country or political subdivision thereof to maintain each registration of the Intellectual Property (other than the Intellectual Property described in the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence), including, without limitation, filing of renewals, affidavits of use, affidavits of incontestability and opposition, interference and cancellation proceedings and payment of maintenance fees, filing fees, taxes or other governmental fees. If any Intellectual Property is infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated in any material respect by a third party, the Grantors shall (x) upon learning of such infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation, promptly notify the Administrative Agent and (y) to the extent the Grantors shall deem appropriate under the circumstances or as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request, promptly sue for infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation, seek injunctive relief where appropriate and recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation, or take such other actions as the Grantors shall deem appropriate under the circumstances or as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to protect such Intellectual Property. Each Grantor shall furnish to the Administrative Agent from time to time (but, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no more frequently than quarterly) statements and schedules further identifying and describing the Intellectual Property and Licenses and such other reports in connection with the Intellectual Property and Licenses as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, all in reasonable detail and promptly upon request of the Administrative Agent, following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any such statements, schedules or reports, the Grantors shall modify this Agreement by amending Schedule II hereto to include any Intellectual Property or License, as the case may be, which becomes part of the Collateral under this Agreement and shall execute and authenticate such documents and do such acts as shall be necessary or, in the judgment of the Administrative Agent, desirable to subject such Intellectual Property and Licenses to the Lien and security interest created by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, no Grantor may abandon or otherwise permit any Intellectual Property to become invalid without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, and if any Intellectual Property is infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated in any material respect by a third party, the Grantors will take such action as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate under the circumstances in its sole and absolute discretion to protect such Intellectual Property.

^^^In no event shall any Grantor, either itself or through any agent, employee, licensee or designee, file an application for the registration of any Trademark or Copyright or the issuance of any Patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States 

Copyright Office, as applicable, or in any similar office or agency of the United States or any country or any political subdivision thereof unless it gives the Administrative Agent written notice thereof within five (5) days before or after such filing. Upon request of the Administrative Agent, each Grantor shall execute, authenticate and deliver any and all assignments, agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to evidence the Administrative Agent’s security interest hereunder in such Intellectual Property and the General Intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby, and each Grantor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent its attorney-in-fact to execute and/or authenticate and file all such writings for the foregoing purposes, all acts of such attorney being hereby ratified and confirmed, and such power (being coupled with an interest) shall be irrevocable until the termination of all Commitments, the repayment of all of the Obligations in full and the termination of each of the Loan Documents.

^^^Without in any way limiting the immediately preceding clause (i), upon request by the Administrative Agent, each Grantor shall establish lock-box or blocked accounts (collectively, “Blocked Accounts”) in such Grantor’s name with such banks as are acceptable to the Administrative Agent (“Collecting Banks”), subject to irrevocable instructions in a form specified by the Administrative Agent, to which the obligors of all Accounts shall, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, directly remit all payments on Accounts and in which such Grantor will immediately deposit all cash payments for Inventory or other cash payments constituting proceeds of Collateral in the identical form in which such payment was made, whether by cash or check. In addition, the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and Lenders, may, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, establish one or more depository accounts at each Collecting Bank or at a centrally located bank in the name of the Administrative Agent or such Grantor as customer (collectively, the “Depository Account”). From and after receipt by any Collecting Bank of written notice from the. Administrative Agent to such Collecting Bank that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all amounts held or deposited in the Blocked Accounts held by such Collecting Bank shall be transferred to the Depository Account. Subject to the foregoing, each Grantor hereby agrees that all payments received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender whether by cash, check, wire transfer or any other instrument, made to such Blocked Accounts or otherwise received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender and whether on the Accounts or as Proceeds of other Collateral or otherwise will be the sole and exclusive property of Lenders. Each Grantor, and any of its Affiliates, employees, agents and other Persons acting for or in concert with such Grantor shall, acting as trustee for the Administrative Agent and Lenders, receive, as the sole and exclusive property of Lenders, any moneys, checks, notes, drafts or other payments relating to and/or constituting proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral which come into the possession or under the control of such Grantor or any Affiliates, employees, agent, or other Persons acting for or in concert with such Grantor, and immediately upon receipt thereof, such Grantor or such Persons shall deposit the same or cause the same to be deposited in kind, in a Blocked Account.

This power is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable until all of the Obligations are paid in full after all Commitments have been terminated.

^^For the purpose of enabling the Administrative Agent to exercise rights and remedies hereunder, at such time as the Administrative Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies in accordance with the provisions of the Financing Agreement and this Agreement, and for no other purpose, each Grantor hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, to the extent assignable, an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to any Grantor) to use, assign, license or sublicense any Intellectual Property now owned or hereafter acquired by any Grantor, wherever the same may be located, including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of the Financing Agreement that limit the right of a Grantor to dispose of its property and Section 5(h) hereof, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Grantor may exploit, use, enjoy, protect, license, sublicense, assign, sell, dispose of or take other actions with respect to the Intellectual Property in the ordinary course of its business.

Further, upon the payment in full of all of the Obligations after the cancellation or termination of the Commitments, the Administrative Agent (subject to Section 10(e) hereof) shall release and reassign to the Grantors all of the 

Administrative Agent’s right, title and interest in and to the Intellectual Property, and the Licenses, all without recourse, representation or warranty whatsoever. The exercise of rights and remedies hereunder by the Administrative Agent shall not terminate the rights of the holders of any licenses or sublicenses theretofore granted by any Grantor in accordance with the second sentence of this clause (c). Each Grantor hereby releases the Administrative Agent from any claims, causes of action and demands at any time arising out of or with respect to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent under the powers of attorney granted herein other than actions taken or omitted to be taken through the Administrative Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction.

^^If any Grantor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, the Administrative Agent may itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement or obligation, in the name of such Grantor or the Administrative Agent, and the expenses of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be jointly and severally payable by the Grantors pursuant to Section 8 hereof and shall be secured by the Collateral.

^^The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency, consignee or other agent or bailee selected by the Administrative Agent in good faith.

^^Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding (i) each Grantor shall remain liable under the Licenses and otherwise with respect to any of the Collateral to the extent set forth therein to perform all of its obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (ii) the exercise by the Administrative Agent of any of its rights hereunder shall not release any Grantor from any of its obligations under the Licenses or otherwise in respect of the Collateral, and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall not have any obligation or liability by reason of this Agreement under the Licenses or with respect to any of the other Collateral, nor shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of any Grantor thereunder or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder.

^Remedies Upon Default. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:

^^The Administrative Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all of the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the Code (whether or not the Code applies to the affected Collateral), and also may (i) take absolute control of the Collateral, including, without limitation, transfer into the Administrative Agent’s name or into the name of its nominee or nominees (to the extent the Administrative Agent has not theretofore done so) and thereafter receive, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, all payments made thereon, give all consents, waivers and ratifications in respect thereof and otherwise act with respect thereto as though it were the outright owner thereof, (ii) require each Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it will at its expense and upon request of the Administrative Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by the Administrative Agent and make it available to the Administrative Agent at a place or places to be designated by the Administrative Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties (in which event such Grantor shall, at its own expense, forthwith cause the same to be moved to the place or places so designated by the Administrative Agent and thereby delivered to the Administrative Agent, store and keep any Collateral so delivered to the Administrative Agent at such place or places pending further action by the Administrative Agent, and, while Collateral shall be so stored and kept, provide such guards and maintenance services as shall be necessary to protect the same and to preserve and maintain the Collateral in good condition), and the Administrative Agent may enter into and occupy any premises owned or leased by any Grantor where the Collateral or any part thereof is located or assembled for a reasonable period in order to effectuate the Administrative Agent’s rights and remedies hereunder or under law, without obligation to any Grantor in respect of such occupation, (iii) without notice except as specified below and without any obligation to prepare or process the Collateral for sale, (A) sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Administrative Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and at such price or prices and upon such other terms as the Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable and/or (B) lease, license or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof upon such terms as the Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable, and (iv) withdraw all cash in the Depository Accounts and apply such monies in payment of the Obligations. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale or any other disposition of the Collateral shall be required by law, at least ten (10) days’ notice to a Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Each Grantor hereby waives any claims against the Administrative Agent and the Lenders arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the Collateral may have been sold at a private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Obligations, even if the Administrative Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree, and waives all rights that such Grantor may have to require that all or any part of the Collateral be marshalled upon any sale (public or private) thereof. Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that (i) any such sale of the Collateral by the Administrative Agent shall be made without warranty, (ii) the Administrative Agent may specifically disclaim any warranties of title, possession, quiet enjoyment or the like, (iii) the Administrative Agent may bid (which bid may be, in whole or in part, in the form of cancellation of indebtedness), if permitted by law, for the purchase, lease, license or other disposition of the Collateral or any portion thereof for the account of the Administrative Agent (on behalf of Lenders) and (iv) such actions set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall not adversely effect the commercial reasonableness of any such sale of the Collateral. In addition to the foregoing, (i) upon written notice to any Grantor from the Administrative Agent, each Grantor shall cease any use of the Intellectual Property or any trademark, patent or copyright similar thereto for any purpose described in such notice; (ii) the Administrative Agent may, at any time and from time to time, upon 10 days’ prior notice to any Grantor, license, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, any of the Intellectual Property, throughout the universe for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the Administrative Agent shall in its sole discretion determine; and (iii) the 

Administrative Agent may, at any time, pursuant to the authority granted in Section 6 hereof (such authority being effective upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default), execute and deliver on behalf of a Grantor, one or more instruments of assignment of the Intellectual Property (or any application or registration thereof), in form suitable for filing, recording or registration in any country.

^^Any cash held by the Administrative Agent as Collateral and all Cash Proceeds received by the Administrative Agent in respect of any sale of or collection from, or other realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter applied (after payment of any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8 hereof) in whole or in part by the Administrative Agent against, all or any part of the Obligations in such order as the Administrative Agent shall elect, consistent with the provisions of the Financing Agreement. Any surplus of such cash or Cash Proceeds held by the Administrative Agent and remaining after payment in full of all of the Obligations after all Commitments have been terminated shall be paid over to whomsoever shall be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.

^^In the event that the proceeds of any such sale, collection or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are legally entitled, the Grantors shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon at the highest rate specified in any applicable Loan Document for interest on overdue principal thereof or such other rate as shall be fixed by applicable law, together with the costs of collection and the reasonable fees, costs, expenses and other client charges of any attorneys employed by the Administrative Agent to collect such deficiency.

^^Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that if the Administrative Agent complies with any applicable state, provincial, or federal law requirements in connection with a disposition of the Collateral, such compliance will not adversely effect the commercial reasonableness of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral.
