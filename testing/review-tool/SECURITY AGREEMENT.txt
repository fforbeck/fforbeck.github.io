> remittance. Each Grantor hereby agrees to indemnify the Collateral Agent and the holders of the Secured Obligations from and against all liabilities, damages, losses, actions, claims, judgments, costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorneys’ fees suffered or incurred by the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Secured Obligations (each, an “Indemnified Party”) because of the maintenance of the foregoing arrangements except as relating to or arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of an Indemnified Party or its officers, employees or agents. In the case of any investigation, litigation or other proceeding, the foregoing indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by a Grantor, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person or any other Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto.

In addition to the rights and remedies hereunder, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, the Collateral Agent shall have the right to enter and remain upon the various premises of the Grantors without cost or charge to the Collateral Agent, and use the same, together with materials, supplies, books and records of the Grantors for the purpose of collecting and liquidating the Collateral, or for preparing for sale and conducting the sale of the Collateral, whether by foreclosure, auction or otherwise. In addition, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, the Collateral Agent may remove Collateral, or any part thereof, from such premises and/or any records with respect thereto, in order to effectively collect or liquidate such Collateral.
>  (d) Nonexclusive Nature of Remedies. Failure by the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Secured Obligations to exercise any right, remedy or option under this Security Agreement, any other Credit Document, any other documents relating to the Secured Obligations, or as provided by law, or any delay by the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Secured Obligations in exercising the same, shall not operate as a waiver of any such right, remedy or option. No waiver hereunder shall be effective unless it is in writing, signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced and then only to the extent specifically stated, which in the case of the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Secured Obligations shall only be granted as provided herein. To the extent permitted by law, neither the Collateral Agent, the holders of the Secured Obligations, nor any party acting as attorney for the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Secured Obligations, shall be liable hereunder for any acts or omissions or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law other than their gross negligence or willful misconduct hereunder. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent and the holders of the Secured Obligations under this Security Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy that the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Secured Obligations may have.
>  (e) Retention of Collateral. To the extent permitted under applicable law, in addition to the rights and remedies hereunder, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may, after providing the notices required by Sections 9-620 and 9-621 of the UCC or otherwise complying with the requirements of applicable law of the relevant jurisdiction, accept or retain all or any portion of the Collateral in satisfaction of the Secured Obligations. Unless and until the Collateral Agent shall have provided such notices, however, the Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have accepted or retained any Collateral in satisfaction of any Secured Obligations for any reason.
>  (f) Deficiency. In the event that the proceeds of any sale, collection or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Secured Obligations are legally entitled, the Grantors shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency (subject to clause (e) immediately above and Section 26), together with interest thereon at the Default Rate for Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans, together with the reasonable costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees. Any surplus remaining after the full

> payment and satisfaction of the Secured Obligations shall be returned to the Grantors or to whomsoever a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine to be entitled thereto.

^Rights of the Collateral Agent.

> (a) Power of Attorney. In addition to other powers of attorney contained herein, each Grantor hereby designates and appoints the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Secured Obligations, and each of its designees or agents, as attorney-in-fact of such Grantor, irrevocably and with power of substitution, with authority to take any or all of the following actions upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default:
> > (i) to demand, collect, settle, compromise and adjust, and give discharges and releases concerning the Collateral, all as the Collateral Agent may reasonably deem appropriate;
> >  (ii) to commence and prosecute any actions at any court for the purposes of collecting any of the Collateral and enforcing any other right in respect thereof;
> >  (iii) to defend, settle or compromise any action brought and, in connection therewith, give such discharge or release as the Collateral Agent may reasonably deem appropriate;
> >  (iv) to receive, open and dispose of mail addressed to a Grantor and endorse checks, notes, drafts, acceptances, money orders, bills of lading, warehouse receipts or other instruments or documents evidencing payment, shipment or storage of the Goods giving rise to the Collateral on behalf of and in the name of such Grantor, or securing, or relating to such Collateral;
> >  (v) to pay or discharge taxes, liens, security interests or other encumbrances levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral;
> >  (vi) to direct any parties liable for any payment in connection with any of the Collateral to make payment of any and all monies due and to become due thereunder directly to the Collateral Agent or as the Collateral Agent shall direct;
> >  (vii) to receive payment of and receipt for any and all monies, claims, and other amounts due and to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any Collateral;
> >  (viii) to sell, assign, transfer, make any agreement in respect of, or otherwise deal with or exercise rights in respect of, any Collateral or the goods or services that have given rise thereto, as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes;
> >  (ix) to adjust and settle claims under any insurance policy relating thereto;
> >  (x) to execute and deliver all assignments, conveyances, statements, financing statements, renewal financing statements, security and pledge agreements, affidavits, notices and other agreements, instruments and documents

> > that the Collateral Agent may reasonably deem appropriate in order to perfect and maintain the security interests and liens granted in this Security Agreement and in order to fully consummate all of the transactions contemplated therein;
> >  (xi) to institute any foreclosure proceedings that the Collateral Agent may reasonably deem appropriate; and
> >  (xii) to do and perform all such other acts and things as the Collateral Agent may reasonably deem appropriate or convenient in connection with the Collateral.
> >  This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable for so long as any of the Secured Obligations shall remain outstanding and until all of the commitments relating thereto shall have been terminated. The Collateral Agent shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges and options expressly or implicitly granted to the Collateral Agent in this Security Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing so. The Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any act or omission or for any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or law in its individual capacity or its capacity as attorney-in-fact except acts or omissions resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct. This power of attorney is conferred on the Collateral Agent solely to protect, preserve and realize upon its security interest in the Collateral.
> >  (b) Assignment by the Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent may from time to time assign its security interest in the Collateral in connection with its resignation as Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 10.06 of the Credit Agreement, and the assignee shall be entitled to all of the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent under this Security Agreement in relation thereto.
> >  (c) The Collateral Agent’s Duty of Care. Other than the exercise of reasonable care to assure the safe custody of the Collateral while being held by the Collateral Agent hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty or liability to preserve rights pertaining thereto, it being understood and agreed that the Grantors shall be responsible for preservation of all rights in the Collateral, and the Collateral Agent shall be relieved of all responsibility for the Collateral upon surrendering it or tendering the surrender of it to the Grantors. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Collateral Agent accords its own property, which shall be no less than the treatment employed by a reasonable and prudent agent in the industry, it being understood that the Collateral Agent shall not have responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any of the Collateral. In the event of a public or private sale of Collateral pursuant to Section 7, the Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to clean, repair or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale.

^Rights of Required Lenders. All rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder, if not exercised by the Collateral Agent, may be exercised by the holders of the Secured Obligations with the consent of the Required Lenders.

^Application of Proceeds. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, any payments in respect of the Secured Obligations and any proceeds of the Collateral, when received by the Collateral Agent or any of the holders of the Secured Obligations in cash or its equivalent, will be applied in reduction of the Secured Obligations in the order set forth in the Credit Agreement, and each Grantor irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of such payments and proceeds and acknowledges and agrees that the Collateral Agent shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reapply any and all such payments and proceeds in the Collateral Agent’s sole discretion, notwithstanding any entry to the contrary upon any of its books and records.

^Release of Collateral. Upon request, the Collateral Agent shall promptly deliver to the Borrower (at the Borrower’s expense) appropriate release documentation to the extent the release of Collateral is permitted under, and on the terms and conditions set forth in, the Credit Agreement; provided that any such release, or the substitution of any of the Collateral for other Collateral, will not alter, vary or diminish in any way the force, effect, lien, pledge or security interest of this Security Agreement as to any and all Collateral not expressly released or substituted, and this Security Agreement shall continue as a first priority lien (subject to Permitted Liens) on any and all Collateral not expressly released or substituted.

^Costs and Expenses. At all times hereafter, whether or not upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Grantors agree to promptly pay upon demand any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) of the Collateral Agent and the holders of the Secured Obligations (a) as required under Section 11.04 of the Credit Agreement and (b) as necessary to protect the Collateral or to exercise any rights or remedies under this Security Agreement or with respect to any of the Collateral. All of the foregoing costs and expenses shall constitute Secured Obligations hereunder.

^Continuing Agreement.

> (a) This Security Agreement shall be a continuing agreement in every respect and shall remain in full force and effect so long as any of the Secured Obligations remains outstanding and until all of the commitments relating thereto have been terminated (other than any obligations with respect to the indemnities and the representations and warranties set forth in the Credit Documents), or the Collateral Agent may release or terminate the security interests hereunder with the consent or at the direction of the Required Lenders or as may be otherwise provided under the Credit Agreement. Upon such payment and termination, this Security Agreement shall be automatically terminated and the Collateral Agent and the holders of the Secured Obligations shall, upon the request and at the expense of the Grantors, forthwith release all of its liens and security interests hereunder and shall execute and deliver all UCC termination statements and/or other documents reasonably requested by the Grantors evidencing such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all releases and indemnities provided hereunder shall survive termination of this Security Agreement.
>  (b) This Security Agreement shall continue to be effective or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, in whole or in part, of any of the Secured Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Collateral Agent or any holder of the Secured Obligations as a preference, fraudulent conveyance or otherwise under any Debtor Relief Laws, all as though such payment had not been made; provided that in the event payment of all or any part of the Secured Obligations is rescinded or must be restored or returned, all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Collateral Agent or any holder of the Secured Obligations in defending and enforcing such reinstatement shall be deemed to be included as a part of the Secured Obligations.

^Amendments and Waivers. This Security Agreement and the provisions hereof may not be amended, waived, modified, changed, discharged or terminated except by written agreement of (a) the Grantors and (b) the Collateral Agent (with the consent or at the direction of the requisite Lenders under the Credit Agreement).

^Successors in Interest. This Security Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall be binding upon each Grantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent and the holders of the Secured Obligations hereunder, to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the holders of the Secured Obligations and their successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that none of the Grantors may assign its rights or delegate its duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the requisite Lenders under the Credit Agreement.

^Release. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor hereby releases the Collateral Agent and each holder of the Secured Obligations, and their respective successors, assigns, officers, attorneys, employees and agents, from any liability for any act or omission or any error of judgment or mistake of fact or of law relating to this Security Agreement or the Collateral, except for any liability arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Collateral Agent or such holder of the Secured Obligations.

^Notices. All notices required or permitted to be given under this Security Agreement shall be given as provided in Section 11.02 of the Credit Agreement.

^Counterparts. This Security Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this Security Agreement to produce or account for more than one such counterpart.

^Headings. The headings of the sections and subsections hereof are provided for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Security Agreement.
