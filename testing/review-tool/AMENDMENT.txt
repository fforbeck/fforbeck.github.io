^will promptly and fully disclose to the Company any and all any and all inventions, discoveries, developments, methods, processes, trade secrets, improvements, works, concepts and ideas, whether or not patentable or copyrightable and whether or not they are made, conceived or reduced to practice during my work for the Company, or using the Company’s data or facilities, which I or others working under my direction develop, make, conceive, create or reduce to practice during my work for the Company, either solely or jointly with others, whether or not during normal hours and whether or not on Company premises (collectively, “Developments”). All Developments will be the sole property of the Company, and I hereby assign to the Company, without further compensation, all my right, title and interest in and to the Developments and any and all related patents, patent applications, copyrights, copyright applications, trademarks and trade names, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights there to in the United States and elsewhere. In addition, I agree that all copyrightable works that I created during my work for the Company shall be considered “works made for hire.” I also hereby waive all claims to moral rights in any Development.
