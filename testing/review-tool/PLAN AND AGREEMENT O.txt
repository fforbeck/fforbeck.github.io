^^Capitalization of Global Earth. Global Earth is authorized by its Articles of Incorporation to issue [[Shares 1]] shares of the Global Earth Common Stock of which [[Shares 8]] shares will be duly and validly issued and outstanding, fully paid, and non-assessable as of the Effective Date, and [[Shares 2]] shares of preferred stock, par value $[[USD Value 2]] per share, of which [[Shares 10: Number]] shares of Class B preferred stock are issued or outstanding. Other than as disclosed herein, there are no outstanding options, contracts, commitments, warrants, preemptive rights, agreements or any rights of any character affecting or relating in any manner to the issuance of the Global Earth Common Stock or other securities or entitling anyone to acquire the Global Earth Common Stock or other securities of Global Earth.

^^Capitalization of the Subsidiary. The Subsidiary is authorized by its Articles of Incorporation to issue [[Shares 1]] shares of the Subsidiary Common Stock, one share of which will be duly and validly issued and outstanding, fully paid, and non-assessable as of the Effective Date, and [[Shares 2]] shares of preferred stock, par value $[[USD Value 2]] per share, none of which are issued or outstanding.

However, it should be understood that one stockholder of Global Earth owns [[Shares 10]] shares of the Global Earth Class B preferred stock which has voting rights equal to [[Shares 11: Number]] shares of the Global Earth Common Stock for every one share of Global Earth preferred stock held, which equates to voting rights o f [[Shares 12: Number]] shares of the Global Earth Common Stock, which amount exceeds the outstanding shares of the Global Earth Common Stock.

^^The first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors shall be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the shareholders at the annual meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. If the shareholders fail to fix the time and place of such first meeting, it shall be held without notice immediately following the annual meeting of the shareholders, and at such time and place, unless by unanimous consent of the director then elected and serving, such time or place shall be changed.

^^Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board.

^^Attendance of a director at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the grounds that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, by the Articles of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.

^^At all meetings of the Board of Directors, 51 percent of the directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

^^The Board of Directors, by resolution passed by 51 percent of the entire Board, may from time to time designate members of the Board to constitute committees, including an executive committee, which shall in each case consist of such number of directors, not less than one, and shall have and may exercise such powers as the Board may determine and specify in the respective resolutions appointing them.
