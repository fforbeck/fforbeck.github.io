^^In the event that [[Partnership]] GP or a [[Partnership]] Group Member becomes aware of an opportunity to acquire Subject Assets with a fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of [[Partnership]]) equal to or greater than $[[USD Value 4]] million, then subject to Section 2.3(b), then as soon as practicable, [[Partnership]] GP or such [[Partnership]] Group Member shall notify the General Partner of such opportunity and deliver to the General Partner, or provide the General Partner access to, all information prepared by or on behalf of, or material information submitted or delivered to, [[Partnership]] GP or such [[Partnership]] Group Member relating to such potential transaction. As soon as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after receipt of such notification and information, the General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership, shall notify [[Partnership]] 

^^^^^ 
GP or the [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member that either (i) the General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership, has elected not to cause a Partnership Group Member to pursue the opportunity to purchase the Subject Assets, or (ii) the General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership, has elected to cause a Partnership Group Member to pursue the opportunity to purchase the Subject Assets. If, at any time, the General Partner abandons such opportunity (as evidenced in writing by the General Partner following the request of [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member), [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member under this Section 2.3(a) may pursue such opportunity. Any Subject Assets which are permitted to be acquired by [[Partnership]] GP or a [[Partnership]] Group Member must be so acquired (i) within 12 months of the later to occur of (A) the date that [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member becomes able to pursue such acquisition in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3(a), and (B) the date upon which all required governmental approvals to consummate such acquisition have been obtained, and (ii) on terms not materially more favorable to [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member than were offered to the Partnership. If either of these conditions are not satisfied, the opportunity must be reoffered to the Partnership in accordance with this Section 2.3(a). 

^^Notwithstanding Section 2.3(a), in the event that (i) [[Partnership]] GP or a [[Partnership]] Group Member becomes aware of an opportunity to make an acquisition that includes both Subject Assets and assets that are not Subject Assets and the Subject Assets have a fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of [[Partnership]]) equal to or greater than $[[USD Value 4]] million but comprise less than half of the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of [[Partnership]]) of the total assets being considered for acquisition or (ii) [[Partnership]] GP or a [[Partnership]] Group Member desires to construct Subject Assets with an estimated construction cost (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of [[Partnership]]) equal to or greater than $[[USD Value 4]] million, then [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member may make such acquisition without first offering the opportunity to the Partnership or may construct such Subject Assets as long as it complies with the following procedures: 

^^^Within 90 days after the consummation of the acquisition or the completion of construction by [[Partnership]] GP or a [[Partnership]] Group Member of the Subject Assets, as the case may be, [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member shall notify the General Partner in writing of such acquisition or construction and offer the Partnership Group the opportunity to purchase such Subject Assets in accordance with this Section 2.3(b) (the “Offer”). The Offer shall set forth the terms relating to the purchase of the Subject Assets and, if [[Partnership]] GP or any [[Partnership]] Group Member desires to utilize the Subject Assets, the Offer will also include the commercially reasonable terms on which the Partnership Group will provide services to [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member to enable [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member to utilize the Subject Assets. As soon as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after receipt of such written notification, the General Partner shall notify [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member in writing that either (x) the General Partner has elected not to cause a Partnership Group Member to purchase the Subject Assets, in which event [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member shall be forever free to continue to own or operate such Subject Assets, or (y) the General Partner has elected to cause a Partnership Group Member to purchase the Subject Assets, in which event the following procedures shall apply. 

^^^If [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member and the General Partner within 60 days after receipt by the General Partner of the Offer are able to agree on the fair 

^^^^^ 
market value of the Subject Assets that are subject to the Offer and the other terms of the Offer including, without limitation, the terms, if any, on which the Partnership Group will provide services to [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member to enable it to utilize the Subject Assets, a Partnership Group Member shall purchase the Subject Assets for the agreed upon fair market value as soon as commercially practicable after such agreement has been reached and, if applicable, enter into an agreement with [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member to provide services in a manner consistent with the Offer. 

^^^If [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member and the General Partner are unable to agree within 60 days after receipt by the General Partner of the Offer on the fair market value of the Subject Assets that are subject to the Offer or the other terms of the Offer including, if applicable, the terms on which the Partnership Group will provide services to [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member to enable it to utilize the Subject Assets, [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Entity and the General Partner will engage a mutually agreed upon investment banking firm to determine the fair market value of the Subject Assets and/or the other terms on which the Partnership Group and [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member are unable to agree. Such investment banking firm will determine the fair market value of the Subject Assets and/or the other terms on which the Partnership Group and [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member are unable to agree within 30 days of its engagement and furnish [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member and the General Partner its determination. The fees of the investment banking firm will be split equally between [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member and the Partnership Group. Once the investment banking firm has submitted its determination of the fair market value of the Subject Assets and/or the other terms on which the Partnership Group and [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member are unable to agree, the General Partner will have the right, but not the obligation, to cause a Partnership Group Member to purchase the Subject Assets pursuant to the Offer as modified by the determination of the investment banking firm. The Partnership Group will provide written notice of its decision to [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member within 30 days after the investment banking firm has submitted its determination. Failure to provide such notice within such 30-day period shall be deemed to constitute a decision not to purchase the Subject Assets. If the General Partner elects to cause a Partnership Group Member to purchase the Subject Assets, then the Partnership Group Member shall purchase the Subject Assets pursuant to the Offer as modified by the determination of the investment banking firm as soon as commercially practicable after such determination and, if applicable, enter into an agreement with [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group Member to provide services in a manner consistent with the Offer, as modified by the determination of the investment banking firm, if applicable. 

^^***Scope of Prohibition***. Except as provided in this Article II and the Partnership Agreement, [[Partnership]] GP and each [[Partnership]] Group Member shall be free to engage in any business activity, including those that may be in direct competition with any Partnership Group Member. 

^^***Enforcement***. [[Partnership]] GP and the [[Partnership]] Group Members agree and acknowledge that the Partnership Group does not have an adequate remedy at law for the breach by [[Partnership]] GP and the [[Partnership]] Group of the covenants and agreements set forth in this Article II, and that any breach by [[Partnership]] GP or the [[Partnership]] Group of the covenants and agreements set forth in this Article II would result in irreparable injury to the Partnership Group. [[Partnership]] GP and the [[Partnership]] Group Members further agree and acknowledge that any Partnership Group Member may, in addition to the other remedies which may be available to the Partnership Group, file a suit in equity to enjoin 

^^^^^ 
[[Partnership]] GP and the [[Partnership]] Group from such breach, and consent to the issuance of injunctive relief under this Agreement. 

^^***Limitation on Acquisitions of Subject Assets by Partnership Group Members***. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a Partnership Group Member who is not a party to this Agreement is prohibited from acquiring Subject Assets. In the event the General Partner desires a Partnership Group Member who is not a party to this Agreement to acquire any Subject Assets, then the General Partner shall first cause such Partnership Group Member to become a party to this Agreement. 

^^***Environmental Indemnification***.

^^^the operation or ownership by [[Partnership]] and its Affiliates of any assets not constituting part of the Assets, including but not limited to underground pipelines retained by the Seller Parties which serve the refineries in Lovington, New Mexico, Artesia, New Mexico and Woods Cross, Utah or the tanks that are part of the 2008 Crude Pipelines, Tanks and Related

^^To the extent that a good faith claim by the Partnership Entities for indemnification under Section 3.1(a)(i) or Section 3.1(a)(ii) arises from events or conditions at the Transferred Tanks or the soil immediately underneath the Transferred Tanks or the Transferred Tanks’ secondary containment, and the [[Partnership]] Entities refuse to provide such indemnification, then the burden of proof shall be on the [[Partnership]] Entities to demonstrate that the events or conditions giving rise to the claim arose after the Closing Date. 

^^The [[Partnership]] Entities shall, during the period that commences on the Closing Date and ends five (5) years thereafter (the “Initial Tank Inspection Period”), reimburse the Partnership Entities for the actual costs associated with the first regularly scheduled API 653 inspection (the “Initial Tank Inspections”) and the costs associated with the replacement of the tank mixers on each of the Transferred Tanks after the Closing Date and any repairs required to be made to the Transferred Tanks as a result of any discovery made during the Initial Tank Inspections; provided, however, that (i) the [[Partnership]] Entities shall not reimburse the Partnership Entities with respect to the relocated crude oil Tank 437 in the Artesia refinery complex and the new crude oil tank to replace crude oil Tank 439 in the Artesia refinery complex more particularly described in the definition of 2008 Crude Pipelines, Tanks and Related Assets, and (ii) upon expiration of the Initial Tank Inspection Period, all of the obligations of the [[Partnership]] Entities pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) shall terminate, except that the Initial Tank Inspection Period shall be extended if, and only to the extent that (A) inaccessibility of the Transferred Tanks during the Initial Tank Inspection Period caused the delay of an Initial Tank Inspection originally scheduled to be preformed during the Initial Tank Inspection Period, and (B) the [[Partnership]] Entities received notice from the Partnership Entities regarding such delay at the time it occurred. 

^^The Partnership Entities shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the [[Partnership]] Entities from and against environmental and Toxic Tort losses (including, without limitation, economic losses, diminution in value and lost profits suffered by third parties), damages, injuries (including, without limitation, personal injury and death), liabilities, claims, demands, causes of action, judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorney’s and expert’s fees) of any and every kind or character, known or unknown, fixed or contingent, suffered or incurred by the [[Partnership]] Entities or any third party to the extent arising out of: 

^^^any violation or correction of violation of Environmental Laws associated with the operation of the Assets by a Person other than a [[Partnership]] Entity or ownership and operation of the Assets by a Person other than a [[Partnership]] Entity, or 

^^^any event or condition associated with the operation of the Assets by a Person other than a [[Partnership]] Entity or ownership and operation of the Assets by a Person other than a [[Partnership]] Entity (including, but not limited to, the presence of Hazardous Substances on, under, about or migrating to or from the Assets or the disposal or release of Hazardous Substances generated by operation of the Assets at non-Asset locations) except, where a [[Partnership]] 

^^^^^ 
Entity is operating an Asset, to the extent resulting from the negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct of such [[Partnership]] Entity including, without limitation, (A) the cost and expense of any investigation, assessment, evaluation, monitoring, containment, cleanup, repair, restoration, remediation, or other corrective action required or necessary under Environmental Laws, (B) the cost or expense of the preparation and implementation of any closure, remedial, corrective action, or other plans required or necessary under Environmental Laws, and (C) the cost and expense for any environmental or Toxic Tort pre-trial, trial, or appellate legal or litigation support work; 

but only to the extent such violation complained of under Section 3.1(d)(i) or such events or conditions included under Section 3.1(d)(ii) occurred after the Closing Date; provided, however, that nothing stated above shall make the Partnership Entities responsible for any post-Closing Date negligent actions or omissions or willful misconduct by the [[Partnership]] Entities. 

^^Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as used in Section 3.1(a) the definition of Assets shall not include the 16” Lovington/Artesia Intermediate Pipeline, the Beeson Pipeline or the Roadrunner Pipeline. 

^^***Limitations Regarding Environmental Indemnification***. The aggregate liability of the [[Partnership]] Entities in respect of all Covered Environmental Losses under Section 3.1(a) shall not exceed (1) with respect to Assets other than the 2008 Crude Pipelines, Tanks and Related Assets, $15.0 million plus an additional $[[USD Value 5: Number]] million in the case of Covered Environmental Losses related to the 8” and 10” Lovington/Artesia Intermediate Pipelines (for clarity, the first $[[USD Value 1: Number]] million limit would apply to Covered Environmental Losses associated with the 8” and 10” Lovington/Artesia Intermediate Pipelines and the 2004 Product Pipelines, Terminal and Related Assets, while the limit between $[[USD Value 1]] and $[[USD Value 2: Number]] would apply only to Covered Environmental Losses associated with the 8” and 10” Lovington/Artesia Intermediate Pipelines) and (2) $[[USD Value 6: Number]] million in the case of Covered Environmental Losses related to the 2008 Crude Pipelines, Tanks and Related Assets.

^^***Additional Indemnification***.  

^^In addition to and not in limitation of the indemnification provided under Section 3.1(a) and Section 3.3, the [[Partnership]] Entities shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Partnership Entities from and against any losses, damages, liabilities, claims, demands, causes of action, judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorney’s and expert’s fees) of any and every kind or character, known or unknown, fixed or contingent, suffered or incurred by the Partnership Entities to the extent arising out of (i) events and conditions associated with the operation of the Assets occurring before the Closing Date (other than Covered Environmental Losses which are provided for under Section 3.1 and Section 3.2) to the extent that the [[Partnership]] Entities are notified in writing of any of the foregoing within five years after the Closing Date, (ii) all legal actions pending against the [[Partnership]] Entities on [[Date 3]], (iii) the completion of remediation projects at the Partnership’s El Paso, Albuquerque and Mountain Home terminals that were ongoing or scheduled as of [[Date 3]], (iv) events and conditions associated with the Retained Assets and whether occurring before or after the Closing Date, and (v) all federal, state and local tax liabilities attributable to the operation or ownership of the Assets prior to the Closing Date, including any such tax liabilities of the [[Partnership]] Entities that may result from the consummation of the formation transactions for the Partnership Entities and the General Partner. 

^^In addition to and not in limitation of the indemnification provided under Section 3.1(b) or the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership Entities shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the [[Partnership]] Entities from and against any losses, damages, liabilities, claims, demands, causes of action, judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorney’s and expert’s fees) of any and every kind or character, known or unknown, fixed or contingent, suffered or incurred by the [[Partnership]] Entities to the extent arising out of events and conditions associated with the operation of the Assets occurring on or after the Closing Date (other than Covered Environmental Losses which are provided for under Section 3.1 except, where a [[Partnership]] Entity is operating an Asset, to the extent resulting from the negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct of such [[Partnership]] Entity), unless such indemnification would not be permitted under the Partnership Agreement by reason of one of the provisos contained in Section 7.7(a) of the Partnership Agreement. 

^^***Indemnification Procedures***.  

^^The Indemnified Party agrees that promptly after it becomes aware of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this Article III, it will provide notice thereof in writing to the Indemnifying Party, specifying the nature of and specific basis for such claim. 

^^The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control all aspects of the defense of (and any counterclaims with respect to) any claims brought against the Indemnified Party that are covered by the indemnification under this Article III, including, without limitation, 

^^^^^ 
the selection of counsel, determination of whether to appeal any decision of any court and the settling of any such matter or any issues relating thereto; provided, however, that no such settlement shall be entered into without the consent of the Indemnified Party unless it includes a full release of the Indemnified Party from such matter or issues, as the case may be. 

^^The Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party, with respect to all aspects of the defense of any claims covered by the indemnification under this Article III, including, without limitation, the prompt furnishing to the Indemnifying Party of any correspondence or other notice relating thereto that the Indemnified Party may receive, permitting the name of the Indemnified Party to be utilized in connection with such defense, the making available to the Indemnifying Party of any files, records or other information of the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party considers relevant to such defense and the making available to the Indemnifying Party of any employees of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that in connection therewith the Indemnifying Party agrees to use reasonable efforts to minimize the impact thereof on the operations of the Indemnified Party and further agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all files, records, and other information furnished by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 3.5. In no event shall the obligation of the Indemnified Party to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence be construed as imposing upon the Indemnified Party an obligation to hire and pay for counsel in connection with the defense of any claims covered by the indemnification set forth in this Article III; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may, at its own option, cost and expense, hire and pay for counsel in connection with any such defense. The Indemnifying Party agrees to keep any such counsel hired by the Indemnified Party informed as to the status of any such defense, but the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to retain sole control over such defense. 

^^In determining the amount of any loss, cost, damage or expense for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the gross amount of the indemnification will be reduced by all amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under contractual indemnities (other than insurance policies) from third Persons. An Indemnified Party shall be obligated to pursue all contractual indemnities that such Indemnified Party has with third Persons outside of this Agreement, provided, however, if the Indemnified Party’s right to such indemnification is assignable, the Indemnified Party may, in its sole discretion and in lieu of pursuing such claim, elect to assign such indemnification claim to the Indemnifying Party to pursue and shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party (including, without limitation, making its relevant books, records, officers, information and testimony reasonably available to the Indemnifying Party) in the Indemnifying Party’s pursuit of such claim. In the event the Indemnified Party recovers under a contractual indemnity from a third Person outside of this Agreement, the amount recovered, less the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in recovering such amounts, shall reduce the amount such Indemnified Party may recover under this Article III and if the Indemnified Party receives any such amounts subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such losses, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount so received by the Indemnified Party. 

^^^^^ 
^^The date on which notification of a claim for indemnification is received by the Indemnifying Party shall determine whether such claim is timely made. 

^^***Limitation on Indemnification Obligations***. 

^^Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, when referring to the indemnification obligations of the [[Partnership]] Entities in Article III, the definition of [[Partnership]] Entities shall be deemed to mean solely (i) the [[Partnership]] Entity or [[Partnership]] Entities that own or operate, or owned or operated immediately prior to the transfer to the Partnership Entities, the Retained Asset, Asset or other property in question with respect to which indemnification is sought by reason of such [[Partnership]] Entity’s or [[Partnership]] Entities’ ownership or operation of the Retained Asset, Asset or other property in question or that is responsible for causing such loss, damage, injury, judgment, claim, cost, expense or other liability suffered or incurred by the Partnership Entities for which it is entitled to indemnification under Article III and (ii) [[Partnership]] 

^^Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, when referring to the indemnification obligations of the Partnership Entities in Article III, the definition of Partnership Entities shall be deemed to mean solely (i) the Partnership Entity or Partnership Entities that own or operate, or owned or operated, the Asset or other property in Partnership Entity’s or Partnership Group Entities’ ownership or operation of the Asset or other property in question or that is responsible for causing such loss, damage, injury, judgment, claim, cost, expense or other liability suffered or incurred by the [[Partnership]] Entities for which they are entitled to indemnification under Article III, (ii) the Partnership and (iii) the Operating Partnership. 

^^***Exclusion from Indemnification***. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as used in Article III the definition of Assets shall not include the Tulsa Transferred Assets, the Sinclair Transferred Assets or the Additional Tulsa East Assets, though the parties hereto acknowledge the environmental indemnity provided among certain of the [[Partnership]] Entities and HEP Entities with respect to the Sinclair Transferred Assets and the Additional Tulsa East Assets contained in the First Amended and Restated Pipelines, Tankage and Loading Rack Throughput Agreement (Tulsa East) dated [[Date 1]] by and between [[Partnership]] Tulsa and [[Partnership]] Energy Storage  Tulsa LLC. 

^^***General***  

^^The Partnership will pay [[Partnership]] an administrative fee (the “Administrative Fee”) in the amount set forth on Schedule I to this Agreement, payable in equal quarterly installments, for the provision by [[Partnership]] and its Affiliates for the Partnership Group’s benefit of all the general and administrative services that [[Partnership]] and its Affiliates have traditionally provided in connection with the Assets including, without limitation, the general and administrative services listed on Schedule I to this Agreement. The General Partner may agree on behalf of the Partnership to increases in the Administrative Fee in connection with 

^^^^^ 
expansions of the operations of the Partnership Group through the acquisition or construction of new assets or businesses. 

^^At the end of each year, the Partnership will have the right to submit to [[Partnership]] a proposal to reduce the amount of the Administrative Fee for that year if the Partnership believes, in good faith, that the general and administrative services performed by [[Partnership]] and its Affiliates for the benefit of the Partnership Group for the year in question do not justify payment of the full Administrative Fee for that year. If the Partnership submits such a proposal to [[Partnership]], [[Partnership]] agrees that it will negotiate in good faith with the Partnership to determine if the Administrative Fee for that year should be reduced and, if so, by how much. 

^^The Administrative Fee shall not include and the Partnership Group shall reimburse [[Partnership]] and its Affiliates for: 

^^^salaries of employees of [[Partnership]] GP, to the extent, but only to the extent, such employees perform services for the Partnership Group; 

^^^the cost of employee benefits relating to employees of [[Partnership]] GP, such as 401(k), pension, and health insurance benefits, to the extent, but only to the extent, such employees perform services for the Partnership Group; and 

^^^all sales, use, excise, value added or similar taxes, if any, that may be applicable from time to time in respect of the services provided by the [[Partnership]] and its Affiliates to the Partnership pursuant to Section 4.1(a). 

^^Either [[Partnership]], on the one hand, or the Partnership, on the other hand, may terminate this Article IV, by providing the other with written notice of its election to do so at least six months prior to the proposed date of termination. 

^^[[Partnership]] Right of First Refusal: Prohibition on Transfer of Refinery Related Assets***. 

^^The Partnership Entities hereby grant to [[Partnership]] a right of first refusal on any proposed Transfer (other than a grant of a security interest to a bona fide third-party lender or a Transfer to another Partnership Group Member) of the Assets that serve the [[Partnership]] Entities’ refineries. 

^^The Partnership Entities are prohibited from Transferring any of the Assets that serve the [[Partnership]] Entities’ refineries to a Partnership Group Member that is not a party to this Agreement. In the event the Partnership Entities wish to Transfer any of the Assets that serve the [[Partnership]] Entities’ refineries to a Partnership Group Member that is not a party to this Agreement, they shall first cause the proposed transferee Partnership Group Member to become a party to this Agreement. 

^^^^^ 
^^The Parties acknowledge that all potential Transfers of Sale Assets pursuant to this Article V are subject to obtaining any and all required written consents of governmental authorities and other third parties and to the terms of all existing agreements in respect of the Sale Assets. 

^^Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as used in Article V the definition of Assets shall not include the Tulsa Transferred Assets. 

^^***Procedures***.  

^^If a Partnership Entity proposes to Transfer any of the Assets that serve the [[Partnership]] Entities’ refineries to any Person pursuant to a bona fide third-party offer (an “Acquisition Proposal”), then the Partnership shall promptly give written notice (a “Disposition Notice”) thereof to [[Partnership]] The Disposition Notice shall set forth the following information in respect of the proposed Transfer: the name and address of the prospective acquiror (the “Proposed Transferee”), the Assets subject to the Acquisition Proposal (the “Sale Assets”), the purchase price offered by such Proposed Transferee (the “Offer Price”), reasonable detail concerning any non-cash portion of the proposed consideration, if any, to allow [[Partnership]] to reasonably determine the fair market value of such non-cash consideration, the Partnership Entities’ estimate of the fair market value of any non-cash consideration and all other material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal that are then known to the Partnership Entities. To the extent the Proposed Transferee’s offer consists of consideration other than cash (or in addition to cash) the Offer Price shall be deemed equal to the amount of any such cash plus the fair market value of such non-cash consideration. In the event [[Partnership]] and the Partnership Entities agree as to the fair market value of any non-cash consideration, [[Partnership]] will provide written notice of its decision regarding the exercise of its right of first refusal to purchase the Sale Assets within 30 days of its receipt of the Disposition Notice (the “First ROFR Acceptance Deadline”). Failure to provide such notice within such 30-day period shall be deemed to constitute a decision not to purchase the Sale Assets. In the event (i) [[Partnership]]’s determination of the fair market value of any non-cash consideration described in the Disposition Notice (to be determined by [[Partnership]] within 30 days of receipt of such Disposition Notice) is less than the fair market value of such consideration as determined by the Partnership Entities in the Disposition Notice and (ii) [[Partnership]] and the Partnership Entities are unable to mutually agree upon the fair market value of such non-cash consideration within 30 days after [[Partnership]] notifies the Partnership Entities of its determination thereof, the Partnership Entities and [[Partnership]] shall engage a mutually-agreed-upon investment banking firm to determine the fair market value of the non-cash consideration. Such investment banking firm shall be instructed to return its decision within 30 days after all material information is submitted thereto, which decision shall be final. The fees of the investment banking firm will be split equally between [[Partnership]] and the Partnership Entities. [[Partnership]] will provide written notice of its decision regarding the exercise of its right of first refusal to purchase the Sale Assets to the Partnership Entities within 30 days after the investment banking firm has submitted its determination (the “Second ROFR Acceptance Deadline”). Failure to provide such notice within such 30-day period shall be deemed to constitute a decision by [[Partnership]] not to purchase the Sale Assets. If [[Partnership]] fails to exercise a right during any applicable period set forth in this Section 5.2(a), [[Partnership]] shall be deemed to have waived its rights with respect to such proposed disposition of the Sale Assets, but not with respect to any future offer of Assets. 

^^^^^ 
^^If [[Partnership]] chooses to exercise its right of first refusal to purchase the Sale Assets under Section 5.2(a), [[Partnership]] and the Partnership Entities shall enter into a purchase and sale agreement for the Sale Assets which shall include the following terms: 

^^^[[Partnership]] will agree to deliver cash for the Offer Price (or any other consideration agreed to by [[Partnership]] and the Partnership Entities (each in their sole discretion)); 

^^^the Partnership Entities will represent that they have good and indefeasible title to the Sale Assets, subject to all recorded and unrecorded matters and all physical conditions and other matters in existence on the closing date for the purchase of the Sale Assets, plus any other such matters as [[Partnership]] may approve, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. If [[Partnership]] desires to obtain any title insurance with respect to the Sale Assets, the full cost and expense of obtaining the same (including but not limited to the cost of title examination, document duplication and policy premium) shall be borne by [[Partnership]]; 

^^^the Partnership Entities will grant to [[Partnership]] the right, exercisable at [[Partnership]]’s risk and expense, to make such surveys, tests and inspections of the Sale Assets as [[Partnership]] may deem desirable, so long as such surveys, tests or inspections do not damage the Sale Assets or interfere with the activities of the Partnership Entities thereon and so long as [[Partnership]] has furnished the Partnership Entities with evidence that adequate liability insurance is in full force and effect; 

^^^[[Partnership]] will have the right to terminate its obligation to purchase the Sale Assets under this Article V if the results of any searches, surveys, tests or inspections conducted pursuant to Section 5.2(b)(ii) or Section 5.2(b)(iii) above are, in the reasonable opinion of [[Partnership]], unsatisfactory; 

^^^the closing date for the purchase of the Sale Assets shall, unless otherwise agreed to by [[Partnership]] and the Partnership Entities, occur no later than 90 days following receipt by the Partnership Entities of written notice by [[Partnership]] of its intention to exercise its option to purchase the Sale Assets pursuant to Section 5.2(a); 

^^^the Partnership Entities shall execute, have acknowledged and deliver to [[Partnership]] a special warranty deed, assignment of easement, or comparable document, as appropriate, in the applicable jurisdiction, on the closing date for the purchase of the Sale Assets constituting real property interests conveying the Sale Assets unto [[Partnership]] free and clear of all encumbrances created by the Partnership Entities other than those set forth in Section 5.2(b)(ii) above; 

^^^the sale of any Sale Assets shall be made on an “as is,” “where is” and “with all faults” basis, and the instruments conveying such Sale Assets shall contain appropriate disclaimers; and 

^^^neither the Partnership Entities nor [[Partnership]] shall have any obligation to sell or buy the Sale Assets if any of the material consents referred to in Section 5.1(c) have not been obtained or such sale or purchase is prohibited by Applicable Law. 

^^^^^ 
^^[[Partnership]] and the Partnership Entities shall cooperate in good faith in obtaining all necessary governmental and other third Person approvals, waivers and consents required for the closing. Any such closing shall be delayed, to the extent required, until the third Business Day following the expiration of any required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; provided, however, that such delay shall not exceed 120 days and, if governmental approvals and waiting periods shall not have been obtained or expired, as the case may be, by such 120th day, then [[Partnership]] shall be deemed to have waived its right of first refusal with respect to the Sale Assets described in the Disposition Notice and thereafter neither [[Partnership]] nor the Partnership shall have any further obligation under this Article V with respect to such Sale Assets unless such Sale Assets again become subject to this Article V pursuant to Section 5.2(d). 

^^If the Transfer to the Proposed Transferee is not consummated in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Proposal within the later of (A) 180 days after the later of the applicable ROFR Acceptance Deadline, and (B) 10 days after the satisfaction of all governmental approval or filing requirements, if any, the Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to lapse, and the Partnership or Partnership Entity may not Transfer any of the Sale Assets described in the Disposition Notice without complying again with the provisions of this Article V if and to the extent then applicable. 

^^***Option to Purchase Tulsa Transferred Assets***. The Parties acknowledge the purchase options and right of first refusal granted to an Affiliate of [[Partnership]] with respect to the Tulsa Transferred Assets in the Purchase Option Agreement. 

^^***Choice of Law***. This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might refer the construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the laws of another state. 

^^***Arbitration Provision***. Any and all Arbitrable Disputes must be resolved through the use of binding arbitration using three arbitrators, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as supplemented to the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code). If there is any inconsistency between this Section and the Commercial Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of this Section will control the rights and obligations of the parties. Arbitration must be initiated within the time limits set forth in this Agreement, or if no such limits apply, then within a reasonable time or the time period allowed by the applicable statute of limitations. Arbitration may be initiated by a party (“Claimant”) serving written notice on the other party (“Respondent”) that the Claimant elects to refer the Arbitrable Dispute to binding arbitration. Claimant’s notice initiating binding arbitration must identify the arbitrator Claimant has appointed. The Respondent shall respond to Claimant within 30 days after receipt of Claimant’s notice, identifying the arbitrator Respondent has appointed. 

^^^^^ 
If the Respondent fails for any reason to name an arbitrator within the 30 day period, Claimant shall petition the American Arbitration Association for appointment of an arbitrator for Respondent’s account. The two arbitrators so chosen shall select a third arbitrator within 30 days after the second arbitrator has been appointed. The Claimant will pay the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator named by it, and the Respondent will pay the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator named by or for it. The costs of petitioning for the appointment of an arbitrator, if any, shall be paid by Respondent. The Claimant and Respondent will each pay one-half of the compensation and expenses of the third arbitrator. All arbitrators must (i) be neutral parties who have never been officers, directors or employees of any of the [[Partnership]] Entities, the Partnership Entities or any of their affiliates and (ii) have not less than seven years experience in the petroleum transportation industry. The hearing will be conducted in Dallas, Texas and commence within 30 days after the selection of the third arbitrator. The [[Partnership]] Entities, the Partnership Entities and the arbitrators shall proceed diligently and in good faith in order that the award may be made as promptly as possible. Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the arbitrators will be binding on and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The arbitrators shall have no right to grant or award indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages of any kind. The Arbitrable Disputes may be arbitrated in a common proceeding along with disputes under other agreements between the [[Partnership]] Entities, the Partnership Entities or their Affiliates to the extent that the issues raised in such disputes are related. Without the written consent of [[Partnership]], on behalf of the [[Partnership]] Entities, and the Partnership, on behalf of the Partnership Entities, no unrelated disputes or third party disputes may be joined to an arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. 

^^***Notice***.  

^^Any notice or other communication given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be (i) delivered personally, (ii) sent by documented overnight delivery service, (iii) sent by email transmission, or (iv) sent by first class mail, postage prepaid (certified or registered mail, return receipt requested).
