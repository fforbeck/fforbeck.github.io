Furthermore, this Agreement and any license or right granted to Hansen hereunder shall be senior in right and time compared to any lien approved or created pursuant to the Amended Plan and the Confirmation Order, so that no foreclosure under any such lien shall modify or terminate such licenses or rights of Hansen. Luna shall not modify the Intuitive-Luna Agreement or any other existing agreement with any third party or enter into any new agreements with Intuitive or any other third party, or otherwise create or incur any obligation (whether by contract or otherwise), in a way that would terminate or narrow the scope or degree of exclusivity of the licenses granted to Hansen herein (it being understood that, for example, the granting of rights by Luna outside of fields licensed to Hansen 

CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. herein or within the scope of Luna’s retained rights hereunder would not constitute a termination or narrowing of Hansen’s licenses granted hereunder) or the licenses or assignments provided for in the Development and Supply Agreement, or in a way that would breach or result in the violation of any other material terms and conditions of this Agreement (or the Development and Supply Agreement); provided, that the foregoing (and following sentence) is not intended to prevent Luna from granting a security interest or lien on the Licensed IP to any lender or a license to same in respect of the lender’s rights and remedies upon an event of default so long as any such security interest, lien or license (or foreclosure thereon) is subject to, and does not terminate or narrow the scope or degree of exclusivity of, the licenses granted to Hansen herein. Luna shall not grant any right, license or interest in, to or under the Licensed IP that terminates or narrows the scope or degree of exclusivity of the rights and licenses granted to Hansen in this Agreement. 

^^New IP Under Future Third Party Agreements. If, at any time after the Effective Date, Luna enters into any agreement with a third party granting rights to such third party under any of the Licensed IP within, or involving a development project within, any of the Medical Fields (without limiting the co-exclusive and exclusive rights of Hansen in Section 2.1), then Luna shall secure the right to license to Hansen within the Medical Robotics Field, Orthopedics Field, Vascular Non-Robotic Field and Endoluminal Non-Robotic Field hereunder any Fiber Optic Shape Sensing/Localization Technology (and all patent rights and other intellectual property rights therein) Created By Luna in connection with such agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, subject to Section 2.4 below (otherwise Luna shall not enter into such agreement). Luna shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the right to license Fiber Optic Shape Sensing/Localization Technology and rights therein Created By Luna under such agreements to Hansen within the Non-Robotic Medical Devices Field (including the Colonoscopy Non-Robotic Field); provided, however, that Luna shall have no duty to secure such right to license to Hansen to the extent within the third party’s field of development, e.g., if the development field is the Colonoscopy Non-Robotic Field, Luna shall have no duty to secure such a right to license to Hansen within the Colonoscopy Non-Robotic Field, but would use commercially reasonable efforts to secure such right to license to Hansen for the rest of the Non-Robotic Medical Devices Field. Luna shall also use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the right to license such Technology and rights Created By Luna under any other third party agreements (i.e., agreements outside the Medical Fields) to Hansen under the license grants to Hansen hereunder, in all such cases, subject to Section 2.4 below. Furthermore, if Luna obtains a license to any Fiber Optic Shape Sensing/Localization Technology (and/or any patent rights and other intellectual property rights therein) and such license includes rights to sublicense within any of the Medical Fields, Luna shall secure that such right to sublicense includes the right to sublicense to Hansen hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (i.e., Hansen shall not be excluded from such sublicensing rights on a discriminatory basis), subject to Section 2.4 below. 

^^Acknowledgement Regarding Hansen Patents. Luna hereby acknowledges and agrees that, if and to the extent any Luna personnel is an inventor of any subject matter claimed within any of the Hansen Patents, any rights or interests in such Hansen Patents that Luna would otherwise obtain therein are assigned to Hansen, and to the extent Luna has not already done so, Luna hereby assigns any such rights or interests in such Hansen Patents to Hansen (which assignment confirmation shall be incorporated in the Settlement Agreement and the other Hansen Settlement Documents, the Amended Plan and Confirmation Order). Accordingly, Luna shall reasonably cooperate with Hansen and provide all reasonable assistance (and execute such further reasonable documents) at Hansen’s cost and expense in connection with any action Hansen may take to document Hansen’s ownership of the Hansen Patents or otherwise prosecute before a patent office to obtain a patent grant and maintain the Hansen Patents. 

CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. 

^^Disclosure of Licensed IP. Periodically upon reasonable request from Hansen (no more frequently than semi-annually until the [****] anniversary of the Effective Date, but without affecting any disclosure obligations under the Development and Supply Agreement), Luna’s and Hansen’s CTO’s (chief technological officer or someone holding the comparable position) shall have a meeting to review the development of the FOSSL Technology for use in or in connection with the Medical Robotics Field or the Licensed IP, and, upon Hansen’s reasonable further request to follow up on such meeting, Luna shall disclose to Hansen any Licensed IP and/or any FOSSL Technology for use in or in connection with the Medical Robotics Field as specified by Hansen in such request in the form of (1) copies of any then-existing reports, summaries, memorandums, articles, invention disclosures, patents and patent applications, in each case (A) to the extent not already disclosed to Hansen and (B) in any event (i) excluding documents to the extent covered by attorney-client privilege, (ii) excluding inventor notebooks, incomplete draft documents and mere email correspondence (but not excluding attached documents to the extent constituting the foregoing documents), and (iii) excluding any information restricted from disclosure to Hansen under third party confidentiality obligations, or (2) Luna may prepare a document fulfilling such request that provides the substance of the responsive information that otherwise would be provided pursuant to clause (1). Luna shall reasonably respond to limited, brief follow-up inquiries from Hansen regarding the items disclosed under (1) and/or (2) above for the purpose of confirming and complementing the sufficiency of the disclosures above. The foregoing shall exclude software source code and related documentation and algorithms designed for the purpose of incorporation into source code (without limiting the provisions of the Development and Supply Agreement). However, the foregoing obligation shall not require Luna to generate any new documents, reports or other materials that do not already exist (except to the extent Luna elects, in its sole discretion, to pursue (2) above instead of (1)) and shall not require Luna to provide Hansen with training with respect to any inventions or Technology contained or described by the claims of such Licensed Patents. 

^^Clarification Regarding Copyrights. With respect to Technology licensed by Luna to Hansen under this Agreement that includes software, works or authorship or copyrighted materials, such licenses shall include the right to copy, modify and make derivative works thereof (and the right to use any ideas, concepts, algorithms and other information contained therein) within the fields and pursuant to the terms and conditions otherwise provided in this Agreement, regardless of when or whether provided or disclosed to Hansen. The foregoing shall not be construed to require the delivery or provision of any particular software (or source code), works of authorship or copyrighted materials except to the extent specifically provided in the Development and Supply Agreement. 

^^Clarification Regarding Non-Licensed Technology. For purposes of clarity, the combination, incorporation or attachment of any Licensed IP or Hansen Licensed IP (as the case may be) as part of or to other Technology that is not Licensed IP or Hansen Licensed IP (as the case may be) shall not result in the portion of the amalgamation that consists of the Technology that is not Licensed IP or Hansen Licensed IP becoming or being transformed into Licensed IP or Hansen Licensed IP under this Agreement. 

^^Third Party License Payments and Agreement Terms. If Hansen’s practice of Licensed IP (including through Hansen’s manufacture, use or sale of Products covered thereby or grant of a sublicense covered thereby) that is in-licensed by Luna from third party licensors and sublicensed to Hansen under Section 2.1 (Luna’s licenses of such third party Licensed IP being “**Third Party Licenses**” and such third party licensors being “**Third Party Licensors**”), results in a royalty, milestone or similar payment becoming due to any Third Party Licensors, Hansen shall be responsible for such payments but solely to the extent the applicable provisions requiring (and setting forth the method for determining the 

CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. amount and calculation of) such royalty, milestone and similar payments are disclosed to Hansen in writing in advance of Hansen incurring any such payments (such payments attributable to Hansen’s practice of Licensed IP being, “**Third Party Payments**”). If permitted by such Third Party Licensors and Luna provides Hansen with the instructions therefor, Hansen shall directly pay such amounts to Third Party Licensors on a timely basis. Otherwise, Hansen shall reimburse Luna for any such Third Party Payments actually paid by Luna to the applicable Third Party Licensor within ten (10) business days of receipt of an invoice therefor from Luna (or within such period of time as may be agreed upon by the Parties after review of the applicable Third Party License). Hansen shall have no obligation to make or reimburse (and Luna shall be solely responsible for) any payments under or with respect to any Third Party Licenses except for those Third Party Payments properly disclosed to Hansen in advance as provided above. Exhibit D sets forth a complete list of all Third Party Payments as of the Effective Date currently known to Luna. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other to provide such information and documents as is reasonably required to calculate, pay and report Third Party Payments. If Luna enters into any Third Party Licenses after the Effective Date, Luna shall promptly disclose to Hansen the details of any Third Party Payments thereunder (but in any event at least thirty (30) days before any Third Party Payments would accrue) as well as all terms and conditions therein that are applicable to Hansen or sublicensees generally. Hansen may choose in its sole discretion to exclude any Third Party License from the licenses granted to Hansen hereunder at any time by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice to Luna thereof, in which case Hansen shall have no obligation to make or reimburse any Third Party Payments with respect to such excluded Third Party License (or comply with the applicable terms and conditions thereof with respect to periods following the effective date of such notice) as of the end of such thirty (30) day notice period (except to the extent and for so long as any Third Party Payments continue to accrue even after such exclusion notice in accordance with terms disclosed to Hansen in advance as provided above). If Hansen elects to exclude any Third Party License from the sublicenses to Hansen hereunder in accordance with the foregoing notice, such Third Party License shall be excluded from the Licensed IP for all purposes under this Agreement. Unless Hansen has excluded any Third Party License in accordance with the foregoing, Hansen hereby agrees to comply with terms and conditions required of and applicable to sublicensees under any of the Third Party Licenses, but solely to the extent disclosed to Hansen in advance. Luna shall maintain all Third Party Licenses (not excluded by Hansen in accordance with the foregoing) in full force and effect and comply with the terms and conditions thereof (except to the extent any failure to do so would not terminate, limit or restrict Hansen’s sublicense of rights thereunder) and Luna shall not terminate or modify any such Third Party Licenses in a materially adverse manner that terminates, limits or restricts the rights sublicensed to Hansen by Luna herein with respect to such Third Party License or in a manner that materially and adversely increases the obligations of Hansen (i) to make Third Party Payments or (ii) to comply with the terms and conditions of such Third Party License. 

^^Reservation of Rights. Except for the rights and licenses expressly granted to, acquired by or confirmed for Hansen and its Affiliates hereunder and to Intuitive under Section 2.1 of the Intuitive-Luna License, Luna retains all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed IP and all of Luna’s other intellectual and industrial property rights. Without limitation of the foregoing and subject at all times to the licenses granted to Hansen under this Agreement, the Parties confirm that Luna retains its rights to use, make and sell (and license) any and all of its intellectual and industrial property rights (i) within technologies, applications and fields that do not involve FOSSL Technology (for example, nanotechnology, secure computing, industrial coating, flame retardants, ultrasonic, and wireless technologies and applications) and (ii) subject to the licenses granted under Section 2.1 and licenses granted to Intuitive under the Intuitive-Luna License, within technologies, applications and fields outside the Medical Fields that do involve FOSSL Technology, including, for example, industrial application, oil exploration, infrastructure, civil, aeronautics, naval, automotive, telecommunication and consumer

^INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

^^Prosecution and Maintenance of Licensed Patents. Luna shall file, prosecute and maintain all Licensed Patents in accordance with Luna’s then-current patent protection and maintenance strategy/ies (determined in Luna’s reasonable discretion) with respect to its patent portfolio at Luna’s sole cost and expense. Luna shall provide Hansen, upon Hansen’s reasonable request, with copies of all material correspondence, applications and filings with respect to the Licensed Patents, filed with, sent to or received from the applicable patent office (following the receipt, filing or submission thereof, as the case may be). If Luna decides to cease prosecution or maintenance of any of the Licensed Patents, Luna shall first provide Hansen with written notice of such decision within a reasonable period (but at least forty-five (45) days if practicable) prior to any pending filing or maintenance fee deadline of which it is aware so Hansen may take on behalf of Luna, at Hansen’s sole cost and expense, whatever reasonable action may be necessary with respect thereto so long as such action is not reasonably likely to be materially adverse to Luna, as would be reasonably apparent at the time such action is taken (and Hansen shall notify Luna of such proposed actions prior to taking them). Hansen may, in its sole discretion, thereafter assume responsibility for such prosecution or maintenance at its sole cost and 

CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. expense, and shall notify Luna in writing prior to assumption if it elects to assume such responsibility. In such event, Hansen shall provide Luna, upon Luna’s request, with copies of all material correspondence, applications, and other filings with respect to any such Licensed Patents assumed by Hansen filed with, sent to or received from the applicable patent offices. In the event Hansen so elects to assume such responsibility for a given Licensed Patent, Luna shall reasonably cooperate at Hansen’s sole cost and expense. If Hansen identifies any potential claims within the Licensed Patents which Luna has not and does not intend to file, prosecute or continue, Hansen, at its option and sole cost and expense, shall have the right to do so on Luna’s behalf with Luna’s prior reasonable consent in each instance (not to be unreasonably withheld), and, in such case, Luna shall provide Hansen reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection therewith, at Hansen’s sole cost and expense and Hansen shall keep Luna reasonably informed of material developments (including providing drafts of submissions for Luna’s review and comment prior to filing). Hansen shall provide Luna, upon Luna’s request, with copies of all material correspondence, applications, and other filings with respect thereto filed with, sent to or received from the patent offices having jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, Hansen, as owner of the Hansen Licensed IP, shall have the sole rights to file, prosecute and maintain and the sole rights to enforce, any patents and patent rights within such Hansen Licensed IP, in Hansen’s sole discretion. 

^^Enforcement of Licensed Patents. 

^^In the Medical Robotics Field. Hansen shall have the right (but not the obligation) (along with Intuitive) to institute enforcement actions against infringement or misappropriation or alleged infringement or misappropriation of the Licensed IP solely to the extent within the Medical Robotics Field, in each case at its own expense. If Hansen institutes such enforcement, Hansen shall be the “**Enforcing Party**” and Intuitive shall be the “**Non-Enforcing Party**”; if Intuitive institutes such enforcement Intuitive shall be the “**Enforcing Party**” and Hansen shall be the “**Non-Enforcing Party**.” The Enforcing Party shall notify Luna and the Non-Enforcing Party in writing of its decision to institute such enforcement action and shall keep them reasonably apprised of all developments in such enforcement actions and consult with them regarding such enforcement activities, but the Enforcing Party shall not be required to obtain any approvals or consents to take such enforcement actions, subject to Section 5.2(e) below. Each of Luna and the Non-Enforcing Party shall, at the Enforcing Party’s expense, reasonably cooperate with the Enforcing Party and provide all reasonable assistance in connection with any such enforcement action, including without limitation agreeing to be named as a party to such action or having such action brought in its name by the Enforcing Party (at the Enforcing Party’s expense, including the cost of any fees and court costs) if and to the extent required for the Enforcing Party to have the legal right to initiate such an enforcement action, subject to Section 5.2(e) below, including without limitation as an estate representative pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1123(b)(3) and otherwise pursuant to the Amended Plan. The Enforcing Party shall retain all recoveries from such enforcement actions, provided that non-monetary recoveries shall inure to the benefit of both the Enforcing Party and the Non-Enforcing Party as an interested party to the extent of its interest. No settlement, consent judgment or other voluntary final disposition of the action that involves an admission of Luna’s (or the Non-Enforcing Party’s) liability or wrongdoing, requires Luna (or the Non-Enforcing Party) to take or refrain from taking any action or incur any payment obligations or other liabilities or otherwise binds Luna (or the Non-Enforcing Party) or that involves an admission of the invalidity or unenforceability of the Licensed IP or any other of Luna’s (or the Non-Enforcing Party’s) intellectual property or that could reasonably be likely to restrict Luna (or the Non-Enforcing Party) from conducting its business, may be entered into without the express written consent of Luna (and, if applicable, the Non-Enforcing Party), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, any patents within the Licensed Patents that are Created By Luna under the Development and Supply Agreement shall be governed by Section 5.2(b) below (as if within the fields specified therein) with respect to the enforcement thereof (without limiting the licenses granted thereto hereunder). 

CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. 

^^In the Orthopedics Field, Endoluminal Non-Robotic Field, and Vascular Non-Robotic Field. Hansen shall have the sole right (but not the obligation) to institute enforcement actions against infringement or misappropriation or alleged infringement or misappropriation of the Licensed IP solely to the extent within the Orthopedics Field, the Vascular Non-Robotic Field, or the Endoluminal Non-Robotic Field, including, if required to bring such action, as an estate representative pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1123(b)(3) (to the extent provided in the Confirmation Order), to the extent required to bring such actions, and otherwise pursuant to the Amended Plan, in each case at its own expense. Hansen shall keep Luna reasonably apprised of all developments in such enforcement actions and shall consult with Luna regarding such enforcement activities (but, for clarity, no approval or consent from Luna shall be required for Hansen to bring such enforcement actions). Luna shall, at Hansen’s expense, reasonably cooperate with Hansen and provide all reasonable assistance in connection with any such litigation, subject to Section 5.2(e) below, including without limitation agreeing to be named as a party to such action or having such action brought in Luna’s name by Hansen (in each case at Hansen’s cost and expense) if and to the extent required for Hansen to have the legal right to initiate such an enforcement action. Hansen shall retain all recoveries from such enforcement actions. No settlement, consent judgment or other voluntary final disposition of the action that involves an admission of Luna’s liability or wrongdoing, requires Luna to take or refrain from taking any action or incur any payment obligations or other liabilities or otherwise binds Luna or that involves an admission of the invalidity or unenforceability of the Licensed IP or any other of Luna’s intellectual property or that could reasonably be likely to restrict Luna from conducting its business, may be entered into without the express written consent of Luna, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

^^In the Non-Robotic Medical Devices Field. Except with respect to claims that fall within clause (a) or (b) above, each of Hansen and Luna shall promptly notify the other of any infringement or misappropriation of the Licensed IP within the Medical Fields of which it becomes aware, and the Parties shall confer together with a view to agreeing upon a common cause of action. If they do not agree upon a common cause of action, then Luna shall have the initial sole right, but shall not be obligated, to institute and prosecute at its own expense, legal actions for infringement or misappropriation of Licensed IP in the Medical Fields outside the Medical Robotics Field, Orthopedics Field, Vascular Non-Robotic Field, and/or Endoluminal Non-Robotic Field. If Luna elects not to pursue such action, then Hansen shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to prosecute at its own expense such action. In all such cases, all monetary recoveries obtained by the enforcing Party (after reimbursement of the Parties’ expenses incurred with respect to such action) shall accrue to and shall be the sole property of such enforcing Party, provided that nonmonetary recoveries shall inure to the benefit of both Parties as an interested party to the extent of its interest. The other Party, at the request and expense of the enforcing Party, shall reasonably assist in the prosecution of such suit (including by being named as a party to such suit if required for the enforcing Party to bring such action), reasonably co-operate with respect thereto, have its employees testify when reasonably requested and make available relevant records, documents, drawings, information, and the like, subject to Section 5.2(e) below. No settlement, consent judgment or other voluntary final disposition of any action brought under this Section 5.2(c) that involves an admission of the non-enforcing Party’s liability or wrongdoing, requires the non-enforcing Party to take or refrain from taking any action or incur any payment obligations or other liabilities or otherwise binds the non-enforcing Party or that involves an admission of the invalidity or unenforceability of the Licensed IP or any other of the non-enforcing Party’s intellectual property or that could reasonably be likely to restrict the non-enforcing Party from conducting its business, may be entered into without the express written consent of such non-enforcing Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

^^Development and Supply Agreement Patents. To the extent that Section 5.2 of the Development and Supply Agreement provides for different terms and conditions with respect to the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of certain Licensed Patents Created By Luna under the Development and Supply Agreement, such terms and conditions in the Development and Supply Agreement shall take precedence (and, to the extent inconsistent, apply in lieu of this Article 5) with respect to such Licensed IP. Without limiting the foregoing, enforcement of any Licensed Patents Created By Luna under the Development and Supply Agreement within the Medical Robotics Field shall be enforced under Section 5.2(b) above as if such section also included the Medical Robotics Field solely with respect to such Licensed Patents. 

^^Certain Indemnities. In the event a Party brings an enforcement action with respect to the Licensed IP under this Section 5.2 (the “**Indemnifying Party**”), such Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the other Party (the “**Indemnitee**”) for any damages, awards, costs and out-of-pocket expenses imposed on or incurred by the Indemnitee as a result of (and to the extent arising from the subject matter of) such enforcement action (including such damages, awards, costs and expenses resulting from such Indemnitee being named as a party to such action or resulting from any court order for costs, fees, penalties, and other amounts (including the posting of bonds, if any) that may be imposed against the Indemnitee in such enforcement proceedings, to the extent such court order does not arise from such Indemnitee’s own actions (unless such actions were directed to be taken by the Indemnifying Party)). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, such indemnification by the Indemnifying Party shall exclude any damages, awards, costs or expenses to the extent based on claims (including cross-claims or counterclaims) that are brought against the Indemnitee with respect to subject matter outside of the infringement, misappropriation, validity or enforceability of the Licensed IP asserted in the action (and outside the actions or omissions of the Indemnifying Party in conducting such enforcement action) or with respect to subject matter which concerns actions or omissions of the Indemnitee that were not directed to be taken or omitted by the Indemnifying Party, in each case, so long as the Indemnitee has the sole right to control the actions based on such claims or subject matter. 

^MISCELLANEOUS 

^^Entire Agreement. Subject to Section 6.7 below and the Amended Plan and Confirmation Order, this Agreement (and its Exhibits) contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and merges all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements between the parties, whether written or oral, with respect to such subject matter, it being understood and agreed that (i) the Hansen-Luna Agreement is being amended and restated in its entirety in this Agreement (but not terminated or superseded) and (ii) the NDA survives in accordance with its terms for the purpose of disclosures made under the NDA prior to the effective date of the Hansen-Luna Agreement (provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in the NDA to the contrary, any information disclosed under the NDA which falls within the Licensed IP may be used and disclosed by Hansen in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licenses granted hereunder and the confidentiality provisions in the Development and Supply Agreement, and the NDA shall not restrict such permitted use and disclosure). This Agreement shall not be modified, amended or cancelled other than in a writing signed by authorized representatives of Luna and Hansen. 

^^No Implied Waiver. Any waiver of any obligation under this Agreement must be in writing. The failure of any Party to enforce at any time any provision of or right under this

Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision or right or any other provision, and shall not affect the right of such Party to enforce such provision or right or any other provision. No waiver of any breach hereof shall be construed to be a waiver of any other breach. 

^^Assignment. This Agreement and the rights of the Parties hereunder may not be assigned by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, this Agreement (along with the rights granted under this Agreement) may be assigned by a Party without the other Party’s consent to an Affiliate or as part of (i) a merger, consolidation, internal reorganization, or acquisition of the assigning Party or (ii) a sale of all or substantially all the assets of the assigning Party. In the event that Luna is acquired by a third party (such third party, hereinafter referred to as an “**Acquiror**”), then the intellectual property of such Acquiror held or developed by such Acquiror (whether prior to or after such acquisition) shall, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, be excluded from the Licensed IP, and such Acquiror (and Affiliates of such Acquiror which are not Subsidiaries of Luna itself) shall be excluded from the meaning of “Affiliate” solely for purposes of the applicable components of the foregoing intellectual property definitions, in all such cases if and only if: (a) Luna remains a Subsidiary of the Acquiror; (b) substantially all intellectual property of Luna and substantially all research and development assets and operations of Luna, in each case relating to FOSSL Technology, remain with Luna and are not transferred to the Acquiror or another Affiliate of the Acquiror; and (c) the scientific and development activities with respect to FOSSL Technology of Luna and the Acquiror (if any) are maintained separate and distinct. For clarity, in the event that Luna is acquired by an Acquiror and each of the criteria described in subclauses (a) through (c) is not satisfied, then the intellectual property of such Acquiror created, invented, generated or developed after the date of such acquisition shall be included within Licensed IP (but not any intellectual property of such Acquiror existing prior to or as of the date of such acquisition). Subject to the foregoing, the respective obligations of the Parties hereto shall bind, and the respective rights of the Parties shall inure to the benefit of, the Parties’ respective permitted assignees and successors. For the avoidance of doubt, any sale or transfer of Licensed IP or Hansen Licensed IP shall only be made fully subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

^^Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue. 

^^Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with: (i) the Bankruptcy Code, and (ii) in the case of applicable non-bankruptcy law, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of laws, or applicable federal law as to a particular subject where federal law governs, such as for example, the Patent Act governing patents or the Copyright Act governing copyrights. 

^^Bankruptcy Court Jurisdiction. Except as provided in subsection (c) and subsection (d), any disputes arising under this Agreement, or related to the meaning, effect and interpretation of the Amended Plan, the Confirmation Order or this Agreement (which Agreement is a part of the Amended Plan and Confirmation Order), shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court. 

^^Exceptions to Bankruptcy Court Jurisdiction. In the event: (i) the Bankruptcy Court lacks or declines to exercise jurisdiction over a dispute arising under this Agreement, for any reason; (ii) the reference of jurisdiction to the Bankruptcy Court is withdrawn, for any reason; (iii) the dispute or enforcement of this Agreement is related to any intellectual property rights of Intuitive, Hansen or Luna, including without limitation any alleged infringement or misappropriation or misuse thereof; or (iv) the dispute or enforcement arises from or with respect to any provision of, or incorporated into, any of Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 4, 5, or 6.3 of this Agreement or causes of action relating 

CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. thereto or arising therefrom, or any of Sections 2.1, 2.2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 or 10.3 of the Development and Supply Agreement or causes of action relating thereto or arising therefrom, then the state or federal courts for or in New Castle County, Delaware shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising under or related to this Agreement. 

^^Alternative Dispute Resolution. Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c) above and subsection (e) below, in the event some provision of a particular Hansen Settlement Document expressly creates an alternative dispute resolution provision as to a particular type of dispute, then such disputes shall be resolved as so specified in the applicable Agreement. 

^^Consent to Jurisdiction. Each Party hereby (i) consents and submits to the venue and co-exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and the courts of New Castle County in the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States sitting in such part of the District of Delaware (without prejudice to either the retained rights and jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court), (ii) agrees that all claims may be heard and determined in such courts, (iii) irrevocably waives (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any objection that it now or hereafter may have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding brought in any of the foregoing courts, and any objection on the ground that any such action or proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, and (iv) agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner permitted by law. Each of the Parties hereby consents to service of process by any party in any suit, action or proceeding in accordance with such applicable law. 

^^Resolving Conflicts. If there is any question as to whether the proper jurisdiction or venue for any dispute is in the Bankruptcy Court or in the Delaware Court, the Bankruptcy Court may decide that issue. 

^^Miscellaneous. The prevailing Party in any final judgment of any such controversy, claim or dispute, or the non-dismissing Party in the event of a dismissal without prejudice, shall be entitled to receive from the other Party the reasonable attorneys’ fees (and all related costs and expenses) and all other costs and expenses paid or incurred by such prevailing Party in connection with such controversy, claim or dispute and in connection with enforcing any judgment or order with respect thereto. 

^^Severability. If for any reason a provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, is finally determined to be unenforceable under applicable law, that provision, or portion thereof, shall nonetheless be enforced, as to circumstances, persons, places and otherwise, to the maximum extent permissible by applicable law so as to give effect to the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. 

^^Effect of Plan/Confirmation Order. The Parties agree that this Section 6.6 is a settlement proposal that shall apply only to the extent approved by the Confirmation Order. The Parties each agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to support the full rights sought by the Parties hereunder, including without limitation by appropriate proffers or other proof in the plan confirmation process. To the maximum extent possible under applicable law (as affected by the Confirmation Order), this Agreement is not an “executory contract” for the purposes of 11 U.S.C. § 365. Rather, this Agreement constitutes a settlement allocation and partition of intellectual property and other rights disputed in the Litigation and in Hansen’s related claims in the Chapter 11 Case but resolved by the Amended Plan and the Confirmation Order. To the extent that a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction rules otherwise than that, the executory parts of this Agreement (herein sometimes called a

“**Section 365(n) Contract**”) shall be interpreted so that the greatest possible rights and licenses of the licensee Party thereto shall be held to be “executed,” thereby minimizing any “executory” parts of the Agreement. As to any Section 365(n) Contract, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the rights and licenses granted by the licensor Party to the licensee Party and its Affiliates hereunder are rights with respect to intellectual property (including without limitation “intellectual property” within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 101), and: (a) all reports, drawings, samples, prototypes and other books and records and embodiments of the intellectual property shall be deemed “embodiments” of the intellectual property protected by 11 U.S.C. § 365 hereunder; (b) any Hansen Settlement Document or obligations thereunder that the licensee Party designates as such an “agreement supplementary” to such Section 365(n) Contract in its discretion at any time before the Confirmation Hearing in a “Plan Supplement” to the Amended Plan, shall be, to the extent permitted by applicable law (as affected by the Confirmation Order) and so designated by the licensee, an “agreement supplementary” to such Section 365(n) Contract, but no other Hansen Settlement Document or obligations shall be an “agreement supplementary” to such Section 365(n) Contract; and (c) there are no “royalty payments” due from Hansen or Luna as a licensee under such Section 365(n) Contract or, since 11 U.S.C. § 365(n)(2) applies only to the Section 365(n) Contract, but not to any “agreement supplementary” to such contract, under any such supplementary agreement. In the event of any conflict between (i) the provisions of this Section 6.6, or (ii) the rights contemplated by 11 U.S.C. § 365(n), and the Amended Plan or the Confirmation Order, the Amended Plan and Confirmation Order shall govern and control. Hansen and Luna each shall be deemed to have made a request for enforcement of all of its rights and licenses pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 365(n)(4), without further action by either licensee Party. 

^^Confidentiality. Confidential information within the Licensed IP and Hansen Licensed IP shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the confidentiality provisions set forth in the Development and Supply Agreement. 

^^Headings. The headings and captions used in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be considered in construing or interpreting this Agreement. 

^^Interpretation. This Agreement has been negotiated by all parties, and each Party has been advised by competent legal counsel. This Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its terms and without any construction in favor of or against any Party. 

^^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but which collectively shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

^^No Effect on 2005 Hansen-Intuitive Cross License. The 2005 Hansen-Intuitive Cross License shall remain in full force and effect and the terms of such 2005 Hansen-Intuitive Cross License shall in no way be modified, affected or superseded by this Agreement. 

^^Notices. Except as may be otherwise provided herein, all notices, requests, waivers, consents and approvals made pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be conclusively deemed to have been duly given (a) when hand delivered to another Party; (b) when sent by facsimile, with receipt confirmation, to the number set forth below if sent between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. recipient’s local time on a business day, or on the next business day if sent by facsimile to the number set forth below if sent other than between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. recipient’s local time on a business day; or (c) the next business day after deposit with a national overnight delivery service, postage prepaid, addressed to the applicable Parties as set forth below with next business day delivery guaranteed, provided that the sending Party receives a confirmation of delivery from the delivery service provider. Each person making a communication hereunder by facsimile shall attempt to promptly confirm by

^^Luna Party. For purposes of this Agreement, Luna Innovations Inc. and Luna Technologies, Inc. may be treated by Hansen as one entity, such that, for example, a notice or consent from Luna Innovations Inc. shall be deemed a valid and effective notice or consent also from Luna Technologies, Inc. (and vice versa) and a payment from Hansen to Luna Innovations Inc. shall fully satisfy Hansen’s obligation with respect to such payment hereunder as to both entities. Luna Innovations Inc. and Luna Technologies, Inc. shall exercise their rights jointly under this Agreement, and will not take conflicting positions with respect to its obligations to Hansen. 

^^Further Assurances. Each Party agrees to take or cause to be taken such further actions, and to execute, deliver and file or cause to be executed, delivered and filed such further documents and instruments, and to obtain such consents, as may be reasonably required or requested by the other Party (to the extent consistent with this Agreement and at the other Party’s expense) in order to effectuate fully the purposes, terms and conditions of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall take such steps reasonably requested by the other Party to perfect, and provide constructive notice of, the licenses and other rights granted to such Party hereunder, including without limitation filings in any governmental office where that is customary or appropriate in accordance with applicable law.
