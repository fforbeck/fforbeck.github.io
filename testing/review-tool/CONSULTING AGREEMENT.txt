^Representations of Each of the Parties. 

^Representations of Consultant. Consultant acknowledges that the shares of Common Stock to be issued to Consultant as the Stock Fee pursuant to this Agreement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”), and accordingly are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144 of the 1933 Act. As such, the Shares may not be resold or transferred unless the Company has received an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company that such resale or transfer is exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act. Further, Consultant agrees that in connection with the acquisition of Shares hereunder, the Consultant represents and warrants to the Company, to the best of its/his knowledge, as follows: (1) Consultant acknowledges that the Consultant has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from duly authorized officers or other representatives of the Company concerning an investment in the Shares, and any additional information which the Consultant has requested; (2) Consultant has had experience in investments in restricted and publicly traded securities; and (3) Consultant has had experience in investments in speculative securities and other investments which involve the risk of loss of investment. Consultant acknowledges that an investment in the Shares is speculative and involves the risk of loss. Consultant has the requisite knowledge to assess the relative merits and of the investment without the necessity of relying upon other advisors, and Consultant can afford the risk of loss of his entire investment in the Shares. Consultant is (i) an accredited investor, as that term is defined in Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, and (ii) a purchaser described in Section 25102 (f) (2) of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968, as amended. In addition, Consultant is acquiring the Shares for the Consultant’s own account for long-term investment and not with a view toward resale or distribution thereof except in accordance with applicable securities laws. 

^Representations of the Company RE: General. The Company represents that: (1) it has the requisite authority and power to enter into this Agreement; (2) this Agreement and the obligations recited hereunder have been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors; (3) the shares of the Company’s Common Stock issued to Consultant are free from the claims and interests of any third party; and (4) the Stock Fee and the Initial Cash Compensation Fee are non-refundable and any termination or attempted cancellation of this Agreement shall not give the Company or any other person the right to receive the refund or return of either or both of said fees. 

^Representations of the Company RE: Valuation of the Shares. The Company represents that: (1) the shares issued to Consultant in payment of the Stock Fee are restricted securities; (2) the Stock Fee has been and for all purposes will be valued at no more than the amount set forth in Exhibit B attached to and incorporated by reference herein; (3) the value accorded the shares issued to Consultant in payment of the Stock Fee is not inconsistent with any values accorded shares of the Company’s Common Stock issued in similar amounts within a reasonable time period prior to or contemporaneous with the payment of the Stock Fee to Consultant; and (4) the value accorded the Stock Fee takes into account the lack of liquidity of the Stock Fee and the lack of marketability of the block of stock represented by the Stock Fee. 

^Additional Representations of the Company. 

In addition, the Company represents that Company, and not Consultant, is responsible to perform any and all due diligence on such lender, equity purchaser or acquisition candidate introduced to it by Consultant under this Agreement, prior to Company receiving funds or closing on any acquisition. However, Consultant shall undertake its best efforts to avoid the introduction of any third party which is known to Consultant to have had a prior reputation or history of questionable, unethical, or illicit activities.

In the event of said merger or acquisition, all compensation to Consultant herein under the schedules set forth herein shall remain due and payable, and any compensation received by the Consultant may be retained in the entirety by Consultant, all without any reduction or pro-rating and shall be considered and remain fully paid and non-assessable. Company shall assure that in the event of any merger, acquisition, or similar change of form of entity that its successor entity shall agree to complete all obligations to Consultant, including the provision and transfer of all compensation herein, and the preservation of the value thereof consistent with the rights granted to Consultant by the Company herein, and to Shareholders.
