**ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS**  
**The USA PATRIOT Act**      **What is money laundering?**      **How big is the problem** **and why is it important?**
The USA PATRIOT Act is designed to detect, deter, and punish terrorists in the United States and abroad. The Act imposes new anti-money laundering requirements on brokerage firms and financial institutions. Since [[Date 3: Date]] all brokerage firms have been required to have new, comprehensive anti-money laundering programs. To help you understand these efforts, we want to provide you with some information about money laundering and our steps to implement the USA PATRIOT Act.      Money laundering is the process of disguising illegally obtained money so that the funds appear to come from legitimate sources or activities. Money laundering occurs in connection with a wide variety of crimes, including illegal arms sales, drug trafficking, robbery, fraud, racketeering, and terrorism.      The use of the U.S. financial system by criminals to facilitate terrorism or other crimes could well taint our financial markets. According to the U.S. State Department, one recent estimate puts the amount of worldwide money laundering activity at $[[USD Value 10: Number]] trillion a year.

**What are we required to do to eliminate money laundering?**
Under new rules required by the USA PATRIOT Act, our anti-money laundering program must designate a special compliance officer, set up employee training, conduct independent audits, and establish policies and procedures to detect and report suspicious transaction and ensure compliance with the new laws.   As part of our required program, we may ask you to provide various identification documents or other information. Until you provide the information or documents we need, we may not be able to effect any transactions for you.

**Investment Objectives**: The typical investment listed with each objective are only some examples of the kinds of investments that have historically been consistent with the listed objectives. However, neither Vyteris, Inc. nor Spencer Trask Ventures, Inc. can assure that any investment will achieve your intended objective. You must make your own investment decisions and determine for yourself if the investments you select are appropriate and consistent with your investment objectives.

Neither Vyteris, Inc. nor Spencer Trask Ventures, Inc. assume responsibility to you for determining if the investments you selected are suitable for you.

**Preservation of Capital**: An investment objective of Preservation of Capital indicates you seek to maintain the principal value of your investments and are interested in investments that have historically demonstrated a very low degree of risk of loss of principal value. Some examples of typical investments might include money market funds and high quality, short-term fixed income products.

**Income**: An investment objective of Income indicates you seek to generate from investments and are interested in investments that have historically demonstrated a low degree of risk of loss of principal value. Some examples of typical investments might include high quality, short and medium-term fixed income products, short-term bond funds and covered call options.

**Capital Appreciation**: An investment objective of Capital Appreciation indicates you seek to grow the principal value of your investments over time and are willing to invest in securities that have historically demonstrated a moderate to above average degree of risk of loss of principal value to pursue this objective. Some examples of typical investments might include common stocks, lower quality, medium-term fixed income products, equity mutual funds and index funds.

**Trading Profits**: An investment objective of Trading Profits indicates you seek to take advantage of short-term trading opportunities, which may involve establishing and liquidating positions quickly. Some examples of typical investments might include short-term purchases and sales of volatile or low priced common stocks, put or call options, spreads, straddles and/or combinations on equities or indexes. This is a high-risk strategy.

**Speculation**: An investment objective of Speculation indicates you seek a significant increase in the principal value of your investments and are willing to accept a corresponding greater degree of risk by investing in securities that have historically demonstrated a high degree of risk of loss of principal value to pursue this objective. Some examples of typical investments might include lower quality, long-term fixed income products, initial public offerings, volatile or low priced common stocks, the purchase of sale of put or call options, spreads, straddles and/or combinations on equities or indexes, and the use of short-term or day trading strategies.
