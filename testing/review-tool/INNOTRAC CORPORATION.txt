^^**Number of Shares**.  

^^Subject to adjustment as provided in (b) below and in Section 4.3, the aggregate number of Shares that are available for issuance pursuant to Awards under the Plan is one million two hundred thousand (1,200,000) Shares, plus any Shares that are subject to outstanding grants under the Prior Plan, which expire, are forfeited or otherwise terminate without delivery of Shares. All of the Shares available for issuance under the Plan (but in no event more than one million two hundred thousand (1,200,000) Shares) may be issued pursuant to Incentive Stock Options. If Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or other Awards are issued in respect of options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other equity awards of an entity acquired, by merger or otherwise, by the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company or any Employer), to the extent such issuance shall not be inconsistent with the terms, limitations and conditions of Code Section 422 or Exchange Act Rule 16b-3, the aggregate number of Shares for which Awards may be made hereunder shall automatically be increased by the number of Shares subject to Awards so issued. Such Shares shall be made available from Shares currently authorized but unissued or Shares currently held (or subsequently acquired) by the Company as treasury shares, including Shares purchased in the open market or in private transactions.

^^The following rules shall apply for purposes of the determination of the number of Shares available for grant under the Plan:

^^^If, for any reason, any Shares awarded or subject to purchase under the Plan or the Prior Plan are not delivered or purchased, or are reacquired by the Company, for reasons including, but not limited to, a forfeiture of Restricted Stock, an exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right with the delivery of fewer Shares than are subject to the Stock Appreciation Right, or termination, expiration or cancellation of an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Unit, Per formance Shares or Performance Units, such Shares (the “Returned Shares”) shall not be charged against, or if previously charged against, shall be added back to, the aggregate number of Shares available for issuance pursuant to Awards under the Plan. If the exercise price and/or tax withholding obligation under an Award is satisfied by tendering Shares to the Company (either by actual delivery or attestation) or by reducing the number of Shares to be delivered to the Participant, only the number of Shares issued net of the Shares so tendered or withheld shall be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.

^^^Each RSU and each Performance Share awarded that may be settled in Shares shall be counted as one Share subject to an Award. Each Performance Unit awarded that may be settled in Shares shall be counted as a number of Shares subject to an award, with the number determined by dividing the value of the Performance Unit at grant by the Fair Market Value of a Share at Grant. Performance Shares and Units and RSUs that may not be settled in Shares shall not result in a charge against the aggregate number of Shares available for issuance pursuant to Awards under this Plan.

^^^Each Stock Appreciation Right that may be settled in Shares shall be counted as one Share subject to an award. Stock Appreciation Rights that may not be settled in Shares shall not result in a charge against the aggregate number of Shares available for issuance. In addition, if a Stock Appreciation Right is granted in connection with an Option and the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right results in the loss of the Option right, the Shares th at otherwise would have been issued upon the exercise of such related Option shall not result in a charge against the aggregate number of Shares available for issuance pursuant to Awards under this Plan. Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, only the actual number of Shares delivered shall be charged against the aggregate number of Shares available, and any additional Shares that were the subject of the Stock Appreciation Right shall be added back to aggregate number of Shares available for issuance and shall again be available for the grant of Awards.

^^**Individual Limits**. Except to the extent the Committee determines that an Award to a Named Executive Officer shall not comply with the performance-based compensation provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, the following rules shall apply to Awards under the Plan:

^^**Options and SARs**. The maximum number of Shares subject to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that, in the aggregate, may be granted in any one calendar year to any one Participant shall be three hundred thousand (300,000) Shares.

^^**Restricted Stock and RSUs**. The maximum aggregate number of Shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units that may be granted in any one calendar year to any one Participant shall be three hundred thousand (300,000) Shares.

^^**Performance Awards**. With respect to Performance Awards that have a specific dollar-value target or are performance units, the maximum aggregate payout (determined as of the end of the applicable performance cycle) with respect to Performance Awards granted in any one calendar year to any one Participant shall be $[[USD Value 1: Number]] With respect to Performance Awards that are payable in Shares, the maximum aggregate payout (determined as of the end of the applicable performance cycle) with respect to Performance Awards granted in any calendar year to any one Participant shall be three hundred thousand (300,000) Shares.

^^**Adjustment of Shares**. If any change in corporate capitalization, such as a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, or any corporate transaction such as a reorganization, reclassification, merger or consolidation or separation, including a spin-off, of the Company or sale or other disposition by the Company of all or a portion of its assets, any other change in the Company’s corporate structure, or any distribution to shareholders (other than a cash dividend) results in the outstanding Shares, or any securities exchanged therefor or received in their place, being exchanged for a different number or class of shares or other securities of the Company, or for shares of stock or other securities of any other corporation; or new, different or additional shares or other securities of the Company or of any other corporation being received by the holders of outstanding Shares; then equitable adjustments shall be made by the Committee, as it determines are necessary and appropriate, in:

^^the limitations on the aggregate number of Shares that may be awarded as set forth in Section 4.1, including, without limitation, with respect to Incentive Stock Options;

^^the limitations on the aggregate number of Shares that may be awarded to any one single Participant as set forth in Section 4.2;

^^the number and class of Shares that may be subject to an Award, and that have not been issued or transferred under an outstanding Award;

^^the Option Price under outstanding Options and the number of Shares to be transferred in settlement of outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights; and

^^the terms, conditions or restrictions of any Award and Agreement, including the price payable for the acquisition of Shares; provided, however, that, to the extent possible, all such adjustments made in respect of each ISO shall be accomplished so that such Option shall continue to be an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.

^^**Grant of Options**. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, Options may be granted to Eligible Participants at any time and from time to time as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee shall have sole discretion in determining the number of Shares subject to Options granted to each Participant. The Committee may grant a Participant ISOs, NQSOs or a combination thereof, and may vary such Awards among Participants; provided that only an employee of the Employer may be granted ISOs.

^^**Agreement**. Each Option grant shall be evidenced by an Agreement that shall specify the Option Exercise Price, the duration of the Option, the number of Shares to which the Option pertains and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine. The Option Agreement shall further specify whether the Award is intended to be an ISO or an NQSO. Any portion of an Option that is not designated in the Agreement as an ISO or otherwise fails or is not qualified as an ISO (even if designated as an ISO) shall be an NQSO.

^^**Option Exercise Price**. The Option Exercise Price for each grant of an Option shall not be less than one hundred percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted.

^^**Duration of Options**. Each Option shall expire at such time as the Committee shall determine at the time of grant; provided, however, that no Option shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of its grant date.

^^**Exercise of Options**. Options granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee shall in each instance approve, including conditions related to the employment of or provision of services by the Participant with the Company or any Employer, which need not be the same for each grant or for each Participant. The Committee may provide in the Agreement for automatic accelerated vesting and other rights upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company or upon the occurrence of other events as specified in the Agreement.

^^**Payment**. Options shall be exercised by the delivery of a written notice of exercise to the Company, setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full payment for the Shares (less any amount previously paid by the Participant to acquire the Option). The Option Exercise Price upon exercise of any Option shall be payable to the Company in full, in any of the following manners: (a) in cash, (b) in cash equivalent approved by the Committee, (c) unless not permitted by the Committee, by tendering previously acquired Shares (or delivering a certification or attestation of ownership of such Shares) having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option Exercise Price (provided that the tendered Shares must have been held by the Participant for six months or such other period required by the Committee), (d) unless not permitted by the Committee, by having the Company withhold Shares from the Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option Exercise Price, or (e) by a combination of (a), (b), (c) and (d). The Committee also may allow cashless exercises as permitted under Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T, subject to applicable securities law restrictions, or by any other means which the Committee determines to be consistent with the Plan's purpose and applicable law.

^^**Nontransferability of Options**.  
^^**Incentive Stock Options**. No ISO granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, all ISOs granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant.

^^**Nonqualified Stock Options**. Except as otherwise provided in a Participant’s Award Agreement consistent with securities and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, no NQSO granted under this Article 5 may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, except as otherwise provided in a Participant’s Award Agreement, all NQSOs granted to a Participant under this Article 5 shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant. In the event of a transfer permitted by the Agreement, appropriate evi dence of any transfer to the Permitted Transferees shall be delivered to the Company at its principal executive office. If all or part of an Option is transferred to a Permitted Transferee, the Permitted Transferee’s rights thereunder shall be subject to the same restrictions and limitations with respect to the Option as the Participant.

^^**Special Rules for ISOs**. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall any Participant who owns (within the meaning of Section 424(d) of the Code) stock of the Company possessing more than ten percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company be eligible to receive an ISO at an Option Exercise Price less than one hundred ten percent ([[Percentage 4: Number]]%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the ISO is granted or be eligible to receive an ISO that is exercisable later than the fifth (5th) anniversary date of its grant. No Participant may be granted ISOs (under the Plan and all other incentive stock option plans o f the Employer) which are first exercisable in any calendar year for Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date an Option is granted) that exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]). Any such excess shall instead automatically be treated as a NQSO.

^^**Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights (or SARs)**. A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted to an Eligible Participant in connection with an Option granted under Article 5 of this Plan or may be granted independently of any Option. A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the holder, within the specified period (which may not exceed 10 years), to exercise the SAR and receive in exchange therefor a payment having an aggregate value equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value of a Share on the exercise date exceeds the specified purchase price (which, unless provided otherwise, shall be the Fair Market Value on the grant date), times the numb er of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised. The Committee may provide in the Agreement for automatic exercise on a certain date, for payment of the proceeds on a certain date, and/or for accelerated vesting and other rights upon the occurrence of a Change in Control or upon the occurrence of other events specified in the Agreement. A SAR granted in connection with an Option (a “**Tandem SAR**”) shall entitle the holder of the related Option, within the period specified for the exercise of the Option, to surrender the unexercised Option, or a portion thereof, and to receive in exchange therefore a payment having an aggregate value equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value of a Share on the exercise date exceeds the Option Exercise Price per Share, times the number of Shares subject to the Option, or portion thereof, which is surrendered. SARs shall be subject to the same transferabil ity restrictions as Nonqualified Stock Options.

^^**Agreement**. Each SAR grant shall be evidenced by an Agreement that shall specify the exercise price, the duration of the SAR, the number of Shares to which the SAR pertains and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine.

^^**Tandem SARs**. Each Tandem SAR shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the related Option, including limitations on transferability, and shall be exercisable only to the extent such Option is exercisable and shall terminate or lapse and cease to be exercisable when the related Option terminates or lapses. The grant of Stock Appreciation Rights related to ISOs must be concurrent with the grant of the ISOs. With respect to NQSOs, the grant either may be concurrent with the grant of the NQSOs, or in connection with NQSOs previously granted under Article 5, which are unexercised and have not terminated or lapsed. font>

^^**Payment**. The Committee shall have sole discretion to determine in each Agreement whether the payment with respect to the exercise of an SAR will be in the form of all cash, all Shares, or any combination thereof. If payment is to be made in Shares, the number of Shares shall be determined based on the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise or the date of payment, as applicable. If the Committee elects to make full payment in Shares, no fractional Shares shall be issued and cash payments shall be made in lieu of fractional Shares. The Committee shall have sole discretion to determine and set forth in the Agre ement the timing of any payment made in cash or Shares, or a combination thereof, upon exercise of SARs, including whether payment will be made in a lump sum, in annual installments or otherwise deferred; and the Committee shall have sole discretion to determine and set forth in the Agreement whether any deferred payments may bear amounts equivalent to interest or cash dividends.

^^**Exercise of SARs**. Upon exercise of a Tandem SAR, the number of Shares subject to exercise under any related Option shall automatically be reduced by the number of Shares represented by the Option or portion thereof which is surrendered.

^^**Grant of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units**. Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") may be made to Eligible Participants as a reward for past service or as an incentive for the performance of future services that will contribute materially to the successful operation of the Employer. Awards of Restricted Stock and RSUs may be made either alone or in addition to or in tandem with other Awards granted under the Plan and may be current grants of Restricted Stock and RSUs or deferred grants of Restricted Stock and RSUs.

^^**Restricted Stock Agreement**. The Restricted Stock Agreement shall set forth the terms of the Award, as determined by the Committee, including, without limitation, the purchase price, if any, to be paid for such Restricted Stock, which may be zero, subject to such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law; any restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock such as continued service or achievement of performance goals; the length of the Restriction Period, if any, and whether any circumstances, such as death, Disability, or a Change in Control, will shorten or terminate the Restriction Period; and rights of the Participant to vote or recei ve dividends with respect to the Shares during the Restriction Period.

^^**Restricted Stock Unit Agreement**. The Restricted Stock Unit Agreement shall set forth the terms of the Award, as determined by the Committee, including without limitation, the number of RSUs granted to the Participant; the restrictions, terms and conditions of the RSU; whether the RSU will be settled in cash, Shares, or a combination of the two and the date when the RSU will be settled; any requirements such as continued service or achievement of certain performance measures; the length of the Restriction Period, if any; whether any circumstances such as Change in Control, termination of employment, Disability or death will shorten or terminate any vestin g or Restriction Period; and whether dividend equivalents will be paid or accrued with respect to the RSUs.

^^**Nontransferability**. Except as otherwise provided in a Participant’s Award Agreement, no RSUs and no Shares of Restricted Stock received by a Participant shall be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of during the Restriction Period.

^^**Certificates**. Upon an Award of Restricted Stock to a Participant, Shares of Restricted Stock shall be registered in the Participant’s name. Certificates, if issued, may either be held in custody by the Company until the Restriction Period expires or until restrictions thereon otherwise lapse and/or be issued to the Participant and registered in the name of the Participant, bearing an appropriate restrictive legend and remaining subject to appropriate stop-transfer orders. If required by the Committee, the Participant shall deliver to the Company one or more stock powers endorsed in blank relating to the Restricted Stock. If and when the Restriction Period expires without a prior forfeiture of the Restricted Stock subject to such Restriction Period, unrestricted certificates for such shares shall be delivered to the Participant or registered in the Participant’s name on the Company’s records; provided, however, that the Committee may cause such legend or legends to be placed on any such certificates as it may deem advisable under the terms of the Plan and the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission and any applicable federal or state law. The Company shall not be required to deliver any fractional Share but will pay, in lieu thereof, the Fair Market Value (determined as of the date the restrictions lapse) of such fractional Share to the holder thereof. Concurrently with the lapse of any risk of forfeiture applicable to the Restricted Stock, the Participant shall be required to pay an amount necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state an d local tax requirements as set out in Article 12 below.

^^**Dividends and Other Distributions**. Except as provided in this Article 7 or in the Award Agreement, a Participant receiving a Restricted Stock Award shall have, with respect to such Restricted Stock Award, all of the rights of a shareholder of the Company, including the right to vote the Shares to the extent, if any, such Shares possess voting rights and the right to receive any dividends; provided, however, the Committee may require that any dividends on such Shares of Restricted Stock shall be automatically deferred and reinvested in additional Restricted Stock subject to the same restrictions as the underlying Award, or may require that dividends and o ther distributions on Restricted Stock shall be paid to the Company for the account of the Participant. The Committee shall determine whether interest shall be paid on such amounts, the rate of any such interest, and the other terms applicable to such amounts.

^^**Grant of Performance Shares/Units**. Performance Shares, Performance Units or both may be granted to Participants in such amounts and upon such terms, and at any time and from time to time, as shall be determined by the Committee.

^^**Value of Performance Shares/Units**. Each Performance Unit shall have an initial value that is established by the Committee at the time of grant. Each Performance Share shall have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. The Committee shall set performance goals in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number and/or value of Performance Shares, Performance Units or both that will be paid out to the Participant. For purposes of this Article 8, the time period during which the performance goals must be met shall be called a “Perfor mance Period.”

^^**Earning of Performance Shares/Units**. Subject to the terms of this Plan, after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Shares/Units shall be entitled to receive a payout of the number and value of Performance Shares/Units earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.

^^**Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Shares/Units**. Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Shares/Units in the form of cash or in Shares (or in a combination thereof) which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Shares/Units at the close of the applicable Performance Period. Such Shares may be granted subject to any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Committee. The determination of the Committee with respect to the form and timing of payout of such Awards shall be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the Award.

Except as otherwise provided in the Participant’s Award Agreement, a Participant shall be entitled to receive any dividends declared with respect to Shares earned in connection with earned grants of Performance Shares/Units, that have not yet been distributed to the Participant (such dividends may be subject to the same accrual, forfeiture, and payout restrictions as apply to dividends earned with respect to Shares of Restricted Stock, as set forth in Section 7.6 herein).

^^**Nontransferability**. Except as otherwise provided in a Participant’s Award Agreement, Performance Shares/Units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, except as otherwise provided in a Participant’s Award Agreement, a Participant’s rights under the Plan shall be exercisable during the Participant’s lifetime only by the Participant or the Participant’s legal representative.

Until the Committee proposes for shareholder vote and shareholders approve a change in the general Performance Measures set forth in this Article 9, the attainment of which may determine the degree of payout and/or vesting with respect to Named Executive Officers’ Awards that are intended to qualify under the performance-based compensation provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Performance Measure(s) to be used for purposes of such Awards shall be chosen from among the following (which may relate to the Company or a business unit, division or subsidiary): earnings, earnings per share, consolidated pre-tax earnings, net earnings, operating income, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), gross margin, revenues, revenue growth, market valu e added, economic value added, return on equity, return on investment, return on assets, return on net assets, return on capital employed, total shareholder return, profit, economic profit, capitalized economic profit, after-tax profit, pre-tax profit, cash flow measures, cash flow return, sales, sales volume, revenues per employee, stock price, cost, or goals related to acquisitions or divestitures. The Committee can establish other Performance Measures for performance Awards granted to Eligible Participants that are not Named Executive Officers and for performance Awards granted to Named Executive Officers that are not intended to qualify under the performance-based compensation exception of Section 162(m) of the Code.

The Committee shall be authorized to make adjustments in performance based criteria or in the terms and conditions of other Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or its financial statements or changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles. The Committee shall also have the discretion to adjust the determinations of the degree of attainment of the pre-established Performance Measures; provided, however, that Awards which are designed to qualify for the performance-based compensation exception from the deductibility limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, and which are held by Named Executive Officers, may not be adjusted upward (except as a result of adjustments permitted by this paragraph), but the Committee shall retain the discretion to adjust such Awards downw ard.

If applicable tax and/or securities laws change to permit Committee discretion to alter the governing Performance Measures without obtaining shareholder approval of such changes, the Committee shall have sole discretion to make such changes without obtaining shareholder approval. In addition, in the event that the Committee determines that it is advisable to grant Awards which shall not qualify for the performance-based compensation exception from the deductibility limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may make such grants without satisfying the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.

Each Participant may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of his or her death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant’s lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant’s death shall be paid to the Participant’s spouse, and if the Participant has no surviving spouse, to the Participant’s estate.

The Committee may permit a Participant to defer such Participant’s receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant by virtue of the exercise of an Option or SAR, the lapse or waiver of restrictions with respect to Restricted Stock, or RSUs, or the satisfaction of any requirements or goals with respect to Performance Shares. If any such deferral election is permitted, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, establish rules and procedures for such payment deferrals, which rules and procedures shall comply with Section 409A of the Code.

^^**Tax Withholding**. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy Federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of any Award under this Plan. If a Participant makes a disposition within the meaning of Section 424(c) of the Code and regulation promulgated thereunder, of any Share or Shares issued to him pursuant to his exercise of an Incentive Stock Option within the two-year period commencing on the day after the date of the grant or wi thin the one-year period commencing on the day after the date of transfer of such Share or Shares to the Optionee pursuant to such exercise, the Optionee shall, within ten (10) days of such disposition, notify the Company thereof, by delivery of written notice to the Company at its principal executive office.

^^**Share Withholding**. With respect to withholding required upon the exercise of Options or SARS, upon the lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock or RSUs, or upon any other taxable event arising as a result of Awards granted hereunder which are to be paid in the form of Shares, Participants may elect, unless not permitted by the Committee, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold Shares having a fair market value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to not more than the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld with respect to the transaction. All such elections shall be subject t o any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

^^**Amendment of Plan**. The Committeemay at any time terminate or from time to time amend the Plan in whole or in part, but no such action shall adversely affect any rights or obligations with respect to any Awards previously granted under the Plan, unless the affected Participants consent in writing. To the extent required by Section 162(m) or 422 of the Code, other applicable law, and/or any Listing Standards, no amendment shall be effective unless approved by the shareholders of the Company.

^^**Amendment of Award Agreement**. The Committee may, at any time, amend outstanding Agreements in a manner not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan; provided, however, except as provided in Sections 13.4 and 13.5, if such amendment is adverse to the Participant, as determined by the Committee, the amendment shall not be effective unless and until the Participant consents, in writing, to such amendment. To the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, the Committee may, at any time, amend an outstanding Agreement in a manner that is not unfavorable to the Participant without the consent of such Participant.

^^**Termination of Plan**. No Awards shall be granted under the Plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date of the Plan.

^^**Cancellation of Awards for Detrimental Activity**. The Committee may provide in the Award Agreement that if a Participant engages in any “Detrimental Activity” (as defined below or in the Award Agreement), the Committee may, notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan to the contrary, cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise restrict or limit any unexpired, unexercised, unpaid or deferred Award as of the first date the Participant engages in the Detrimental Activity, unless sooner terminated by operation of another term of this Plan or any other agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agreement m ay also provide that if the Participant exercises an Option or SAR, receives a Performance Share, Performance Unit, or RSU payout, or receives Shares under an Award at any time during the period beginning six months prior to the date the Participant first engages in Detrimental Activity and ending six months after the date the Participant ceases to engage in any Detrimental Activity, the Participant shall be required to pay to the Company the excess of the then fair market value of the Shares subject to the Award over the total price paid by the Participant for such Shares.

For purposes of this Section, “Detrimental Activity” means any of the following, as determined by the Committee in good faith: (i) the violation of any agreement between the Company and the Participant relating to the disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers, suppliers, licensees, licensors or contractors, or the performance of competitive services; (ii) conduct that constitutes Cause (as defined in Section 2.5 above), whether or not the Participant’s employment is terminated for Cause; (iii) making, or causing or attempting to cause any other person to make, any statement, either written or oral, or conveying any information about the Company which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company; (iv) improperly disclosing or oth erwise misusing any confidential information regarding the Company; or (v) the refusal or failure of a Participant to provide, upon the request of the Company, a certification, in a form satisfactory to the Company, that he or she is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan; provided, that the Committee may provide in the Agreement that only certain of the restrictions provided above apply for purposes of the Award Agreement.

^^**Assumption or Cancellation of Awards Upon a Corporate Transaction**. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of the Company, the merger of the Company with or into another corporation such that shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the merger exchange their shares of stock in the Company for cash and/or shares of another entity or any other Change in Control or corporate transaction to which the Committee deems this provision applicable (any such event is referred to as a “Corporate Transaction”), the Committee may, in its discretion, cause each Award to be assumed or for an equivalent Award to be substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation (and adjusted as appropriate).

In addition or in the alternative, the Committee, in its discretion, may determine that all or certain types of Awards will be cancelled at or immediately prior to the time of the Corporate Transaction; provided, however, that at least 15 days prior to the Corporate Transaction (or, if not feasible to provide 15 days notice, within a reasonable period prior to the Corporate Transaction), the Committee notifies the Participant that, subject to rescission if the Corporate Transaction is not successfully completed within a certain period, the Award will be terminated and provides the Participant, either, at the election of the Committee, (i) a payment (in cash or Shares) equal to value of the Award, as determined below, or (ii) the right to exercise the Option or other Award as to all Shares, including Shares as to which the Option or other Award would not otherwise be exercisable (or with respect to Restricted Stock, RSUs, Performance Shares or Performance Units, provide that all restrictions shall lapse) prior to the Corporate Transaction. For purposes of this provision, the value of the Award shall be measured as of the date of the Corporate Transaction and shall equal the amount of cash or Shares that would be payable to the Participant upon exercise or vesting of the Award, less the amount of any payment required to be tendered by the Participant upon such exercise. For example, the amount payable to the Participant upon the Committee’s decision to cancel outstanding Options would equal the difference between the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Options and the Exercise Price for such Options, computed as of the date of the Corporate Transaction.

^^**Restrictions on Shares**. All certificates for Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any Listing Standards and any applicable federal or state laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be placed on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. In making such determination, the Committee may rely upon an opinion of counsel for the Company.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no liability to deliver any Shares under the Plan or make any other distribution of the benefits under the Plan unless such delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable state and federal laws (including, without limitation and if applicable, the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933), and any applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.

^^**Rights of a Shareholder**. Except as otherwise provided in Article 7 of the Plan and in the Restricted Stock Agreement, each Participant who receives an Award of Restricted Stock shall have all of the rights of a shareholder with respect to such Shares, including the right to vote the Shares to the extent, if any, such Shares possess voting rights and receive dividends and other distributions. Except as provided otherwise in the Plan or in an Agreement, no Participant awarded an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, RSU, Performance Unit, or Performance Share shall have any right as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by such Award pri or to the date of issuance to him or his delegate of a certificate or certificates for such Shares or the date the Participant’s name is registered on the Company’s book as the shareholder of record with respect to such Shares.

^^**No Implied Rights**. Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the service of the Employer, or to serve as a Director thereof, or interfere in any way with the right of the Employer to terminate his or her employment or other service relationship at any time. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any employee benefit plan, severance program, or other arrangement of the Employer for the benefit of its employees. No Participant shall have any claim to an Award until it is actually granted under the Plan. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan, such right shall, except as otherwise provided by the Committee, be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.

^^**Compliance with Laws.**  

^^At all times when the Committee determines that compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code is required or desirable, all Awards to Named Executive Officers shall comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code. In addition, in the event that changes are made to Section 162(m) of the Code to permit greater flexibility with respect to any Awards, the Committee may, subject to the requirements of Article 13, make any adjustments it deems appropriate.

^^The Plan and the grant of Awards shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations and to such approvals by any United States government or regulatory agency as may be required. Any provision herein relating to compliance with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act shall not be applicable with respect to participation in the Plan by Participants who are not Insiders.

^^**Successors**. The terms of the Plan shall be binding upon the Company, and its successors and assigns.

^^**Tax Elections**. Each Participant agrees to give the Committee prompt written notice of any election made by such Participant under Code Section 83(b) or any similar provision thereof.

^^**Compliance With Code Section 409A**. The Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A and any regulations or guidance that may be adopted thereunder from time to time, including any transition relief available under applicable guidance related to Code Section 409A. The Plan may be amended or interpreted by the Committee as it determines necessary or appropriate in accordance with Code Section 409A and to avoid a plan failure under Code Section 409A(a)(1).

^^**Legal Construction**.  
^^**Severability**. If any provision of this Plan or an Agreement is or becomes or is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or would disqualify the Plan or any Agreement under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Agreement, it shall be stricken and the remainder of the Plan or the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

^^**Gender and Number**. Where the context admits, words in any gender shall include the other gender, words in the singular shall include the plural and words in the plural shall include the singular.

^^**Governing Law**. To the extent not preempted by federal law, the Plan and all Agreements hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Georgia.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Plan is executed as of the date approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and ratified by the Board of Directors of the Company, the 29th day of March , 2010.
