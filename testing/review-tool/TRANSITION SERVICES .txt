\centered **TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT**

This Transition Services Agreement (this “**Services Agreement**”) is entered into and effective as of the [[Date 1: Date]] (the “**Effective Date**”), by and between [[Provider]], a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (“**Provider**”), and [[Recipient]], Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (“**Recipient**”). Provider and Recipient each may be referred to herein as a “**Party**” and collectively, as the “**Parties**.” 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Provider has determined that it is appropriate and desirable to separate Recipient and Provider into two publicly-traded companies by separating Provider from Recipient and transferring to Recipient Provider’s measurement group and foil business (the “**MGF Business**”) (such separation, the “**Separation**”); 

WHEREAS, Provider and Recipient have entered into that certain Master Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of the [[Date 2: Date]] (the “**Master Separation** **Agreement**”), in order to carry out, effect and consummate the Separation; and 

WHEREAS, to facilitate the Separation, Provider and Recipient deem it to be appropriate and in the best interests of Provider and Recipient that Provider provide certain services to Recipient pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants, agreements, representations and warranties contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 

^**Services**  

^^**General**. In accordance with the provisions hereof, Provider, through its Subsidiaries (as defined below) and their respective employees, agents or contractors, shall provide to Recipient and its Subsidiaries, and Recipient shall purchase from Provider, the services described in **Schedule A** (each a “**Service**” and collectively, the “**Services**”). In addition to a description of each Service, **Schedule A** shall set forth, where relevant, the maximum level or amount of each Service, applicable performance times and the pricing parameters for each Service. **Schedule A** may be amended from time to time by written agreement of the Parties. For purposes of this Services Agreement, “**Subsidiary**” of any Party means a corporation or other organization whether incorporated or unincorporated of which at least a majority of the securities or interests having by the terms thereof ordinary voting power to elect at least a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such Party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by such Party and one or more of its Subsidiaries; **provided**, **however**, that no person that is not directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the Party shall be a Subsidiary of such Party unless such Party controls, or has the right, power or ability to control, that person. 

^^**Quality of Services**. Subject to Section 1.3, Provider shall perform each of the Services (i) in a workmanlike and professional manner, (ii) with the same degree of care as it 

exercises in performing its own functions of a like or similar nature, (iii) utilizing individuals of suitable experience, training and skill, and (iv) in a timely manner in accordance with the provisions of this Services Agreement. 

^^**Forecasts**. Recipient shall provide Provider with a monthly forecast of its requested level of Services not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of each calendar month, unless no change in the existing service levels are forecast for such calendar month. The Service levels, if any, initially requested by Recipient (the “**Initial Service Levels**”) shall be as set forth on **Schedule A**. Service levels may be decreased from the Initial Service Levels upon Recipient’s delivery to Provider of written notice of such decrease specified in reasonable detail at least sixty (60) days in advance of the month to which the decrease forecast relates. Any increase in the scope of Services, including the addition of any new Services, shall be negotiated in good faith by the Parties; **provided** **that** Provider shall not be required to perform additional or enhanced services, except to the extent that it has available resources and receives compensation acceptable in its reasonable discretion. To the extent any Services are mischaracterized in **Schedule A**, Provider and Recipient shall negotiate in good faith to amend **Schedule A** as appropriate. 

^^**Third Party Services**. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that certain of the Services to be provided under this Services Agreement may have been, and may continue to be, provided to Recipient, by third parties designated by Provider. To the extent so provided, Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause such third parties to provide such Services in accordance with the provisions of this Services Agreement and/or (ii) enable Recipient and its Subsidiaries to avail itself of such Services; **provided**, **however**, that if any such third party is unable or unwilling to provide any such Services, Provider shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to determine the manner in which such Services can best be provided, and, if there is any change to the level or cost of Services provided as a result, Provider and Recipient shall negotiate in good faith to amend Schedule A as appropriate. 

^^**Responsible Personnel**. Each Party shall (i) from time to time designate a senior level manager who shall have overall responsibility for the administration and operation of this Services Agreement (each, a “**Party Representative**”) and (ii) upon reasonable request of the other Party, provide such other Party with a list of key management personnel who may be contacted by such other Party with respect to each Service. 

^^**Consultation**. At either Party’s reasonable request, the Parties shall meet and discuss the nature, quality and level of Services covered by this Services Agreement and any modifications a Party may wish to make to the Services and other matters specified in **Schedule** A. 

^^**Recovery Procedures**. Provider shall maintain, consistent with past practices applicable to the MGF Business immediately prior to the Separation, operational recovery procedures to insure the availability of systems and the integrity of data relating to the Services at all times. In the event of the unavailability of any such system or the loss or destruction of any such data, Provider shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with past practices applicable to the MGF Business immediately prior to the Separation, to restore such systems and recover or replace such data as quickly and completely as is practicable. 

^^**Monitoring and Reports; Books and Records; Audit Right**.

^^Provider shall maintain books and records in reasonable and customary detail pertaining to the provision of Services pursuant to this Services Agreement. Provider shall make such books and records available for inspection by Recipient or its authorized representatives during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice to Provider, and shall retain such books and records for periods consistent with the retention policies applicable to the MGF Business immediately prior to the Separation.

^^Upon thirty (30) days’ advance notice to Provider, Recipient may audit (or cause an independent third party auditor to audit), during regular business hours and in a manner that complies with the building and security requirements of Provider, the books, records and facilities of Provider pertaining to the provision of Services pursuant to this Services Agreement to the extent necessary to determine Provider’s compliance with this Services Agreement. For any given Service, Recipient shall have the right to audit such books, records and facilities of Provider once for each twelve month period during which payment obligations are due. Any audit under this Section 1.8(b) shall not interfere unreasonably with the operations of Provider. Recipient shall pay the costs of conducting such audit, unless the results of an audit reasonably indicate an overpayment by Recipient of ten percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) or more (such percentage to be determined by reference to the Services which are subject to the specific audit), in which case, Provider shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of Recipient. 

^^Provider shall provide Recipient, at no cost to Recipient, with customary reports concerning the performance of the Services and as Recipient otherwise reasonably requests from time to time.

^**Compensation; Billing**  

^^**Service Fees**. In consideration of providing the Services, Provider will charge Recipient the monthly fees or time and materials fees indicated for each Service listed on **Schedule A** (each, a “**Service Fee**” and collectively, the “**Service Fees**”). In the event that for any month there shall be an increase or decrease of the level of any Service by [[Percentage 2: Number]]% or more compared to the Initial Service Levels for any Service described on **Schedule A** for which there is a monthly fee, if any, the Service Fee for such Service shall be adjusted proportionately. 

^^**Expenses**. Provider shall also be entitled to charge Recipient for its reasonable documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Provider in providing the Services, as more particularly provided on **Schedule A** (“**Expenses**”). 

^^**Invoices**. Not later than 30 days after the end of each calendar month, Provider shall send Recipient an invoice that includes in reasonable detail the Service Fees and Expenses due for Services provided to Recipient for such month. Payments of invoices shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available United States funds to one or more accounts specified in writing by Provider. Payment shall be made within 30 days after the date of receipt of Provider’s invoice. All amounts payable to Provider hereunder shall be paid without setoff, deduction, abatement or counterclaim. 

^^**Payment Delay**. If Recipient fails to make any payment of a material invoice within 60 days from the date such payment was due, Provider shall have the right, at its sole option, upon 10 business days’ written notice (a “**Suspension** **Notice**”), to suspend performance of the Services until payment has been received.

^^**Finance Charges**. With respect to the unpaid amount of any invoice not paid in full within 30 days of receipt, a finance charge of [[Percentage 3: Number]]% per month, payable from the date of the invoice to the date payment is received, shall be due and payable to Provider. In addition, Recipient shall indemnify Provider for its costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred to collect any unpaid amount. Recipient shall not be liable for the payment of any finance charges pursuant to this Section 2.5, and Provider shall not be authorized to suspend performance pursuant to Section 2.4, to the extent, but only to the extent, that Recipient in good faith is in the process of disputing the fees or expenses to which such finance charges or performance relates in accordance with Section 13.2. 

^**Cooperation and Consents**  

^^**General**. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with and provide assistance to the other Party in carrying out the provisions of this Services Agreement. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, exchanging information, providing electronic systems used in connection with the Services, making adjustments and obtaining all consents, licenses, sublicenses or approvals necessary to permit each party to perform its obligations hereunder. 

^^**Transition**. At the request of Recipient in contemplation of the termination of any Services hereunder, in whole or in part, Provider shall cooperate with Recipient, at Recipient’s expense, in transitioning such Services to Recipient or any third-party service provider designated by Recipient. 

^^**Consents**. Provider will obtain any third-party consents necessary to enable it to provide the Services as forth on **Schedule 3.3** (the “**Consents**”), **provided** **that** Provider shall not be required to pay any consideration or incur any liability therefor. If any such consent is not obtained, the parties will reasonably cooperate with one another to achieve a reasonable alternative arrangement with respect thereto. 

^**Confidentiality**  

^^**Generally**. In the course of the performance of the Services, each Party may become aware of confidential and proprietary information of the other Party (“**Confidential** **Information**”). All Confidential Information disclosed by a Party during the term of this Services Agreement shall remain the property of the disclosing Party and shall be used by the receiving Party only in accordance with the provisions of this Services Agreement. 

^^**Identification; Term**. (a) Except in the case of (x) information that is subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 4.5 of the Master Separation Agreement or (y) information exchanged in furtherance of the performance of the Services hereunder that is of a type that is generally regarded by the Parties to be confidential information (such as pricing, customer and production information), to which this subsection (a) shall not apply, if disclosed in written form, Confidential Information shall be identified as Confidential Information by an appropriate legend. For a period of 5 years from the date of first receipt thereof, the receiving Party shall (i) treat all such information in the same manner as it treats its own confidential information, in any event exercising reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure of such information to others; (ii) use such information only for the purposes set forth herein; and (iii) disclose such information only to its employees who have a need to know such information in the performance of their duties hereunder.

^^**Injunctive Relief**. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it would be difficult to measure the damages that might result from any actual or threatened breach of this Article 4 and that such actual or threatened breach by it may result in immediate, irreparable and continuing injury to the other Party and that a remedy at law for any such actual or threatened breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, the Parties agree that the non-breaching Party, in its sole discretion and in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief or other equitable relief, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, in case of any such actual or threatened breach (without the necessity of actual injury being proved and with the necessity of posting bond).

Recipient shall not acquire any rights in any Provider Property pursuant to this Services Agreement.

^^It is the intent of the Parties to use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve expeditiously any Dispute between them with respect to the matters covered hereby that may arise from time to time on a mutually acceptable negotiated basis.

^^If the Dispute is not resolved by the end of the seven (7) day period referred to in Section 13.2(a), or if the Party Representatives agree that the Dispute can not be resolved by them, either Party may deliver a notice (an “**Escalation Notice**”) demanding an in-person meeting involving appropriate representatives of the Parties at a senior level of management of the Parties (or if the Parties agree, of the appropriate strategic business unit or division within such entity) (collectively, “**Senior Executives**”).
