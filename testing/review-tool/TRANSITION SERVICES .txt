\centered **DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES; STANDARD OF PERFORMANCE** 

^On the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, Cadbury shall provide, or cause to be provided, to DPS and its Affiliates the services identified in  Schedule A hereto, as such  Schedule A may be from time to time supplemented or modified in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (the “**Cadbury Services**”). 

^^^^^ 
^On the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, DPS shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Cadbury and its Affiliates the services identified in  Schedule B hereto, as such  Schedule B may be from time to time supplemented or modified in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (the “**DPS Services**”, and together with Cadbury Services, the “**Services**”). 

^. Each party shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, provide the Services in a commercially reasonable manner and with reasonable skill and care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the standard of care for provision of the Services shall in all material respects be no less than the level of care, skill and quality as are currently being provided to and by such party and its Affiliates and have been provided in the preceding twelve months,  provided that, in the case where the Services are not currently being provided, each party shall provide the Services in a commercially reasonable manner and with reasonable skill and care. The relevant measurement of performance of the Services shall be the measurement metrics, if any, currently used by DPS and its Affiliates or by Cadbury and its Affiliates, as the case may be. Cadbury and DPS shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates that is a Providing Party to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in all matters relating to the provision of the Services. With respect to actions taken by the Receiving Party in connection with the Services received, the Receiving Party shall use the Services in a commercially reasonable manner in compliance with all applicable Laws. The Providing Party hereby grants the Receiving Party a license under all of its Intellectual Property used in the performance of Services solely to the extent required for the Receiving Party to receive the Services hereunder. 

^. Cadbury and DPS shall each use its (and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to use their) reasonable best efforts to obtain all required consents, licenses or approvals necessary to perform the Services (the “**Consents**”) (that have not already been procured prior to the Distribution Date) as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof;  provided that, each party shall notify the other in writing of any terms to which a proposed Consent is to be subject and shall use its reasonable best efforts to agree with the relevant third party any reasonable amendments to a proposed Consent requested by Cadbury or DPS, as the case may be. If the parties are unable to obtain any required Consents, the parties shall negotiate in good faith reasonable modifications of the Services so that such Consents are not required. 

^. (a) Each party recognizes that in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, or as a result of the parties’ ongoing relationship pursuant to this Agreement, non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information (“**Confidential Information**”) belonging or relating to the other party or its Affiliates (each, a “**Disclosing Party**”), including Confidential Information regarding the Services may be disclosed or become known to the other party or its Affiliates or its officers, directors, controlling persons, employees, lenders, agents, representatives, accountants and counsel (collectively, “**Representatives**”) (each, a “**Recipient**”). Each party acknowledges that all Confidential Information disclosed in connection with the provision of Services remains the property of the Disclosing Party. Unless otherwise expressed in writing to the other party, information, including any information expressed orally, that is exchanged between the parties or their respective Affiliates in connection with the performance of their respective obligations under this Agreement shall be 

^^^^^ 
presumed to be Confidential Information. Each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, keep the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information confidential and take such precautions with respect to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as it normally takes with its own non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information, which shall be no less than a reasonable standard of care under the circumstances. This obligation shall not apply to: 

^^^information that, at the time of disclosure, is in the public domain or generally known in the industry, other than as a result of a breach by the other party or its Affiliates or Representatives of any of the provisions of this Agreement or of any other duty of confidentiality owed to the other party or its Recipients; 

^^^information that, after disclosure to the Recipient hereunder, is published or otherwise becomes part of the public domain or generally known in the industry through no fault of the party (or such party’s Recipients) to whom the information was disclosed; 

^^^information that a party can demonstrate through its records was in its lawful possession or the lawful possession of a Recipient at the time such party received such information (except for Confidential Information regarding DPS or its Affiliates in Cadbury’s possession or Confidential Information regarding Cadbury or its Affiliates in the possession of Representatives that are transferred to DPS or its Affiliates, each of which shall continue to be confidential); and 

^^^information that may be received by a Recipient in good faith from a source other than the Disclosing Party, which source either has no duty of confidentiality to such other party or, if such source does have a duty of confidentiality, the Recipient of such Confidential Information was unaware of or had no reasonable basis for knowing thereof (provided that, if a Recipient later becomes aware or reasonably should know of such duty, this exception shall no longer apply). 

^^Each party shall inform any and all of its Recipients that receive Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party of the confidential and proprietary nature of such Confidential Information and shall inform such Recipients that such Confidential Information is to be kept strictly proprietary and confidential pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Each party shall explain to each such Recipient his or her responsibilities and obligations under this Section 2.5, and shall establish commercially reasonable procedures to ensure that the Confidential Information is properly protected and monitored for purposes of adhering to the terms of this Section 2.5. Except to the extent otherwise specifically provided in this Section 2.5, the Confidential Information will be kept confidential by each party and its Recipients. Each party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Section 2.5 by any of its Recipients. 

^^Each party and its Recipients shall maintain, however, the right to disclose the Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party if required to do so by Law, subpoena or other legal process, provided that, in the case of any such potential disclosure pursuant to this Section 2.5(c), the Recipient shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such requirement and shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep and assist the Disclosing Party in keeping it confidential by all appropriate means, and shall, to the extent reasonably practical, afford the 

^^^^^ 
Disclosing Party the opportunity to contest the disclosure obligation and cooperate with any Recipients in seeking any such protective order or other appropriate legal remedy, in each case, at the Disclosing Party’s request and expense. If a Recipient finds it necessary to disclose any Confidential Information, such Person will disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that it is advised in writing by counsel is legally required to be disclosed and will use its reasonable best efforts, at the Disclosing Party’s request and expense, to ensure that all Confidential Information so disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment. 

^^Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, no Recipient shall disclose nor make any further use of a Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and upon written request shall immediately return or destroy all such Confidential Information as shall be in written or other tangible form (including all copies thereof), provided, however, that each party shall be entitled to retain one record copy in its legal department, to be held in strict confidence, subject to the above exceptions; and provided, further, that if such Confidential Information is destroyed, upon written request, shall certify the same to the Disclosing Party. 

^^The parties acknowledge that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement pertaining to Confidential Information, the non-breaching party will not have an adequate remedy at law and may suffer irreparable injury as a result of any such breach. Therefore, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching party shall, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, be entitled to specific performance, without posting bond or other security. 

^. The Transition Representatives shall meet regularly in person, telephonically, or as they otherwise agree at least monthly for the first year following the date hereof, to discuss any issues arising under this Agreement and the need for any modifications or additions hereto. 

^. Subject to Section 2.8, except with respect to any services of the type described on  Schedule D, if either party can demonstrate that, by virtue of the transactions contemplated by the Separation Agreement, either party requires a service not currently provided for under this Agreement that was provided by or to a member of the Cadbury and its Affiliates by or to DPS and its Affiliates, as the case may be, in the twenty-four (24) month period prior to the Distribution Date, the parties shall cooperate and endeavor in good faith to modify and supplement the schedules to this Agreement (including any other attachments thereto, if any) to accurately identify those services, and to specify the manner and term in which such services shall be performed and, as appropriate, to enter into ancillary transition services agreements addressing the provision of certain critical services or the provision of the Services in certain jurisdictions (including price calculated pursuant to Section 4), in order to refine and further effect the understandings set forth in this Agreement. Unless otherwise so agreed, in no event shall any such modification or supplement to the schedules (other than the election by a party to identify a Service which it does not elect to receive and for which service fees shall not be payable) or the execution of any ancillary agreements result in any change in the fees for the Services. 

^^^^^ 
^. Where a service that was provided by a third party to Cadbury or its Affiliates (including DPS and its Affiliates) prior to the Distribution Date is not otherwise provided for in this Agreement and is reasonably required by DPS or Cadbury to continue DPS’ or Cadbury’s remaining businesses, as applicable, in substantially the same manner as that carried on in the twenty-four month period prior to the Distribution Date, Cadbury or DPS, as applicable, will provide such assistance as is reasonable under the circumstances so as to enable the other party to put in place similar arrangements with such third party. 

^. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses. 

^. Subject to Section 2.3 of this Agreement, the Cadbury Providing Party and DPS Providing Party (each, as defined below), as applicable, shall be responsible for selecting and supervising in good faith the personnel who will perform any particular Cadbury Service or DPS Service, respectively, and performing all administrative services with respect to such personnel, including establishing compensation structure and work load balancing. 

^. Cadbury and DPS shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, make available on a timely basis to the Providing Party all information reasonably requested by such Providing Party to enable it to provide the Services and provide reasonable access to the Providing Party of such party’s premises to the extent necessary for the purpose of providing the Services. 

\centered **PERIOD OF SERVICES: TERM** 

^. The parties agree that, except as otherwise designated in this Agreement, all services covered by this Agreement shall terminate on the date indicated on  Schedule A or  Schedule B, as applicable, unless earlier terminated by the Receiving Party upon such prior written notice as set forth on  Schedule A or  Schedule B, as applicable, or pursuant to Section 3.2(c) of this Agreement or extended by the mutual written agreement of the Providing Party and Receiving Party. This Agreement shall terminate when the terms for all Services have terminated; provided, however, that Sections 2.5, 2.9 and Articles 5, 7, 8 and 9 shall survive any such termination; provided further that Sections 5.4 and 5.7 shall continue for one year only. 

^. (a) Each party shall, or shall cause its Affiliate that is providing the Services hereunder (a “**Providing Party**”) to, cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with the party receiving the Services hereunder (a “**Receiving Party**”) to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for the Services to the Receiving Party or its designee. Each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) assume performance of the Services within shorter time periods than those specified on  Schedule A or  Schedule B, as applicable, and (ii) make or obtain any approvals, permits and licenses and implement such systems as may be necessary for 

^^^^^ 
such party to provide the Services independently as soon as reasonably practicable following the Distribution Date. 

^^As soon as reasonably practicable following the termination of this Agreement or the discontinuation of any Services, the Providing Party shall deliver to the Receiving Party, at the Receiving Party’s expense, copies of any books, records, data and reports reasonably requested by the Receiving Party in connection with such Services. Subject to the requirements of any applicable Laws, each Receiving Party agrees to keep any information it receives pursuant to this Section 3.2(b) that relates to a Disclosing Party confidential in accordance with Section 2.5. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a party may terminate any Service or all Services immediately upon notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of this Agreement by the breaching party that is not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice from the non-breaching party.

^^The Incoming Service Fee and the Outgoing Service Fee shall include all out-of-pocket charges and costs of performing the Services hereunder, including, without limitation, license fees, royalties or provider services fees. 

^^The fees payable by a Receiving Party to a Providing Party shall, in each case, be taken to be exclusive of any value added Taxes, sales Taxes, or similar Taxes (“**VAT**”) properly chargeable in respect of the transactions hereunder, and an amount equal to such Taxes so chargeable shall, subject to receipt of a valid VAT receipt or invoice in accordance with Section 4.1(f) below, be paid by the Receiving Party to the Providing Party in addition to the fees otherwise payable under this Agreement. 

^^In the event that applicable Law requires that any amount in respect of Taxes be withheld from any payment by a Receiving Party to a Providing Party under this Agreement, 

^^^^^ 
the Receiving Party shall withhold the required amounts and pay such withheld amounts over to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with the requirements of the applicable Law, and any amount so withheld and paid over shall be treated as having been paid to the Providing Party, and the Receiving Party shall not be required to pay any additional amount as a result of or in respect of such withholding. 

^^In each case where an amount in respect of VAT is payable by the Receiving Party in respect of a service provided by the Providing Party, DPS or Cadbury (as the case may be) shall ensure that the Providing Party shall furnish in a timely manner a valid VAT receipt or invoice to the Receiving Party in the form and manner required by Law to allow the Receiving Party or, as the case may be, any of its affiliates to recover such Tax to the extent allowable by Law.

\centered **ASSIGNMENT** 

^. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 6, neither party shall assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement, or any part hereof, without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Either party may, at its election, assign its rights and corresponding obligations under this Agreement in whole or in one or more parts to any one or more of its Affiliates so long as such assigning party agrees to remain fully obligated for the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement as they relate to the Services being assigned.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a party assigns its rights and/or obligations hereunder upon a sale or transfer to an unrelated party as set forth above, (a) such transferor shall be entitled to continue to receive the Services (other than the Services that are the subject of such assignment) from the other party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement following any such assignment, and the other party shall have no right to terminate this Agreement as a result of such assignment, and (b) no such assignment shall relieve the transferor of any obligations hereunder in the event that such transferee fails to perform in any manner or breaches this Agreement.

\centered **LIMITATION ON LIABILITY; THIRD PARTY CLAIMS** 

^. Except with respect to damages included in an award against an Indemnified Party (as defined herein) resulting from a Third Party Claim for which such party is indemnified hereunder, in no event shall either party or its respective Representatives and Affiliates have any liability whether in contract or tort (including negligence and strict liability) or otherwise, at law or equity, for loss of profit, diminution in value, loss of goodwill, claims of customers, or consequential, incidental or punitive damages or other special damages as a result of, provision of or failure to provide the services under the terms of this Agreement. Subject to such other remedies permitted by Section 2.5 above and except as specifically provided in the previous sentence or in the event of bad faith or willful misconduct of such party, the maximum liability of each party and its Representatives and Affiliates to, and the sole remedy of, the other party or its Affiliates or Representatives for any act or failure to act in connection herewith (including but not limited to, the performance or breach of this Agreement) shall be the greater of (i) a refund of price paid for the particular Service, (ii) such other party’s incremental cost of performing the Service itself or (iii) such other party’s incremental cost of obtaining the Service from a third party.

^^^^^ 
RELIABILITY, ACCURACY, SUITABILITY, COMPLETENESS, WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS TO THE SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED HEREUNDER. 

^. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1, each party (the “**Indemnifying Party**”) agrees that it shall protect, indemnify and hold the other party and its Affiliates and their Representatives (each, the “**Indemnified Party**”) harmless from and against all Indemnifiable Losses and shall defend such party at the Indemnifying Party’s expense (to the extent of any Third Party Claims) in any Action for injuries to or death of any Person or Persons or loss of or damage to the property of any Person or Persons whomsoever (including without limitation the agents and employees of the Indemnified Party) or infringement of any Person’s or Persons’ Intellectual Property arising out of the actions of the Indemnifying Party, or its Representatives, in connection with or as a result of this Agreement or the performance of the Indemnifying Party’s Services, the unauthorized use by the Indemnifying Party of the Services or other obligations hereunder. 

^. The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of any indemnifiable Action asserted against it. 

^. Except with respect to any Third Party Claims, the receipt by a Receiving Party or its Affiliates of the Services shall be an unqualified acceptance of, and a waiver by, the Receiving Party and its Affiliates of their rights to make any claim (other than based on gross negligence or fraud) with respect to such Services unless the Receiving Party gives written notice of the claim to the Providing Party within the later of (i) sixty (60) days after receipt of the Service by the Receiving Party or its Affiliates or (ii) thirty (30) days after the date on which the Receiving Party became, or should have become, aware of the facts, events, occurrences or circumstances underlying such claim;  provided, that, in no event shall the Receiving Party be entitled to give notice of a claim more than one (1) year after receipt of the Service by the Receiving Party or its Affiliates. 

\centered **DISPUTE RESOLUTION** 

^. Prior to the initiation of formal dispute resolution procedures, the parties shall first attempt to resolve any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby informally, as follows: 

^^The parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes on a local level and shall attempt to initiate such efforts within two Business Days after receipt of notice of any such dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve a dispute in an amount of time that either party deems reasonable under the circumstances, such party may refer the dispute for resolution to the Senior Managers pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1(b). 

^^Within five Business Days of a notice under Section 8.1(a) referring a dispute for resolution by Senior Managers, the Transition Representatives (or other employees of the parties) shall each prepare and provide to the Senior Managers of each party summaries of the 

^^^^^ 
relevant information and background of the dispute, along with any appropriate supporting documentation. The designated Senior Managers will confer as often as they deem reasonably necessary in order to gather and exchange information, discuss the dispute and negotiate in good faith, in an effort to resolve the dispute without the need for any formal proceedings. 

^^Formal proceedings for the resolution of a dispute pursuant to Section 8.2 may not be initiated until at least ten Business Days after the receipt by a party of a notice under Section 8.1(a) referring a dispute to Senior Managers. 

^. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby which cannot be resolved through the procedures described herein or therein shall be finally resolved solely and exclusively by means of arbitration to be conducted in English in the City of New York. The arbitration shall be conducted by a sole arbitrator appointed by agreement of the parties, or failing such agreement, under the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association and the arbitration will proceed under such Rules. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties, and a judgment upon the award may be obtained and entered in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that any arbitration shall be kept confidential and any element of such arbitration (including but not limited to any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral submissions, and any awards) shall not be disclosed beyond the arbitral tribunal, the parties, their counsel and any Person necessary to conduct the arbitration, except as may be required in recognition and enforcement proceedings, if any, or in order to satisfy disclosure obligations imposed by any applicable Law. The parties agree to cooperate in providing each other with all discovery, including but not limited to the exchange of documents and depositions of parties and non-parties, reasonably related to the issues in the arbitration. If the parties are unable to agree on any matter relating to such discovery, any such difference shall be determined by the arbitrator. The parties also agree to submit to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts sitting in New York, New York, for the limited purpose of enforcing this arbitration agreement (including, where appropriate, issuing injunctive relief) or any award resulting from arbitration pursuant to this Section 8.2. The parties agree that the arbitration proceeding described in this Section 8.2 is the sole and exclusive manner in which the parties may resolve disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement;  provided,  however, that the parties expressly agree that nothing herein shall prevent the parties from applying to a court having jurisdiction over any of the parties hereto for provisional, injunctive or interim relief to preserve the status quo or otherwise to prevent irreparable harm to a party pending the outcome of arbitration. The prevailing party in any arbitration shall be entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs and the non-prevailing party shall be responsible for all expenses of the arbitration. 

^. If there is a dispute between the parties, each party shall continue to perform all of their obligations under this Agreement (including the obligations in dispute).

**Notice** **Type of**        **Required to** **Service**    **Description of Specific Services**    **Term**    **Terminate** Network Services    The current planned date for IT readiness in the new Cadbury office at the Rogers AR sales facility is 15 June. Due to delays in the separation of the DPS / Cadbury network, Rogers Cadbury users will continue to have access to the Cadbury network through at least 30 June. So long as all new network connectivity is complete by 30 June, the following IT services will continue to be provided to Cadbury users at no charge.    2 months    30 days Desk Phone Network connectivity (until network separation) File server / Network Printer access (until network separation) 

The following services will not be available: DPS-issued PCs. (Users will keep their Cadbury PCs). 

If funding or project delays push the readiness date past 30 June and network separation occurs, the fallback will be to have the Cadbury users set up in the DPS environment. 

Users will lose any file server access for their Cadbury accounts, so any saved data would need to be removed prior to the split. Users will have access to the local services (network, printer) via their DPS credentials, but would be required to access the confectionery system via VPN. Further, their Cadbury email will only be accessible via the WebMail functionality while on the DPS network or via VPN to use the Outlook client. While on VPN, they would not have the ability to print locally, though documents could be saved and printed to the network once completed. 

Incremental costs due to a post 30 June move will be agreed to/funded by the site owner
