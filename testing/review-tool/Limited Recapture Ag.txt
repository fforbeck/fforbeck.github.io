The Policy, which applies prospectively from its [[Date 2: Date]] effective date, gives the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (“**Committee**”) discretion to determine whether and to what extent to seek recoupment under the Policy based on specific facts and circumstances. The Policy applies to all Performance Based Compensation and Trading Profits on any Company securities trades received by the Executive during the twenty four months prior to the disclosure of a Material Restatement. 

^Agreement.

^^Cash Awards Under STIC Program: All cash awards under the STIC Program paid to Executive after the Effective Date and within the 24-month period preceding the first public announcement by the Company of the Material Restatement to the extent that such cash awards paid to Executive exceeded, in the determination of the Committee, the amounts that would have been paid had the Company’s consolidated

^^Performance Based Stock Awards Under Stock Plan: All performance based stock options, performance based deferred stock shares or other performance based equity awards granted to Executive after the Effective Date and vested within the 24-month period preceding the first public announcement by the Company of the Material Restatement to the extent that such awards, in the determination of the Committee, would have not vested had the Company’s consolidated financial results that are the subject of the Material Restatement initially been reported correctly. 

^^Trading Profits: All Trading Profits received by Executive within the 24-month period preceding the first public announcement by the Company of the Material Restatement, regardless of whether such Trading Profits would have been received had the Company’s consolidated financial results that are the subject of the Material Restatement initially been reported correctly.

^^Shares of Company Stock: Shares of stock of the Company received by Executive pursuant to performance based awards granted under the Stock Plan for which recoupment is sought, whether as an award of performance based deferred stock shares, upon the exercise of performance based stock options or otherwise, shall be transferred to the Company by the Executive; provided, however, that in the event the Executive no longer holds such shares, the Executive shall (i) transfer to the Company an equivalent number of other shares of Company stock held by Executive or (ii) if the Executive does not hold other shares of Company stock, pay to the Company an amount in cash equal to the greater of (A) the fair market value of the number of shares of Company stock for which recoupment is sought, as determined by the Committee, or (B) the proceeds received by the Executive upon the disposition of the shares for which recoupment is sought.
