Within two (2) business days after receipt of an executed copy of this Agreement, Buyer shall deposit with Escrow Agent (i) an executed original of the Escrow Agreement and the sum of Three Hundred Eighty Five Thousand One Hundred Twenty Five and No/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]) as the initial earnest money deposit under this Agreement (the “Initial Deposit”). If Buyer waives its right to terminate this Agreement prior to the Inspection Date in accordance with Section 6.4, Buyer shall deposit in escrow with the Escrow Agent an additional amount of Three Hundred Eighty Five Thousand One Hundred Twenty Five and No/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 1]]) (the “Additional Deposit”) in cash or other immediately available funds within two (2) business day after the Inspection Date.

The Earnest Money (less $[[USD Value 7: Number]] to be paid to Seller) shall be refunded to Buyer in the event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than Buyer’s default. 

^^Disbursement. Whenever the Earnest Money is by the terms hereof to be disbursed by Escrow Agent, Seller and Buyer agree promptly to execute and deliver such notice or notices as shall be necessary, if any, or, in the opinion of Escrow Agent, appropriate to authorize Escrow Agent to make such disbursement. 

Section 4. Purchase Price. 

^^Purchase Price. The purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) for the Property shall be Twenty Five Million Six Hundred Seventy Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]). The Purchase Price, as adjusted by the prorations provided in Section 4.2 hereof and as reduced by the Earnest Money, which, unless otherwise disbursed hereunder, shall be disbursed by Escrow Agent at the Closing to Seller as a portion of the Purchase Price, shall be paid by Buyer to Seller at the Closing in United States dollars, by Federal Reserve System wire transfer or other immediately available funds reasonably acceptable to Seller. 

^^Prorations. The following items shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of the Proration Date, and prorations favoring Buyer, to the extent determinable as of the Proration Date, shall reduce the Purchase Price payable by Buyer at the Closing, and such prorations favoring Seller, to the extent determinable as of the Proration Date, shall increase the Purchase Price payable by Buyer at the Closing: 

4.2.1 Rents, additional rents, common area maintenance charges, charges for taxes and insurance premiums or for escalations thereof, if any, and other charges under the Leases as and when collected (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Rents”). 

^^Delinquent Rents. No prorations shall be made for any unpaid amounts due and payable prior to Closing or for delinquent rents existing, if any, as of the Closing Date. If, on the Proration Date, any Tenant is delinquent in the payment of any Rents, then Buyer shall refund to Seller an amount, up to the full amount of such receivable, at the time of Buyer’s receipt of any Rents from such Tenant, to the extent of any portion of such payment remaining after Buyer deducts all Rents due Buyer from such Tenant after the Proration Date. 

^^Expense Reconciliation. At least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a reasonably detailed reconciliation for each Tenant showing all common area maintenance charges, property taxes, insurance and other operating cost pass-throughs payable by Tenants (collectively, the “Operating Expenses”) incurred by Seller from the beginning of the then-current calendar year (and if the prior calendar year has not been reconciled with Tenants, also for said prior year) (or, if different, such Tenants’ then-current annual billing period for Operating Expenses, and if the prior period has not been reconciled with Tenants, also for said prior period) through the Closing Date, and any Operating Expense estimates or charges collected by Seller during the same period of time and relating to such Tenant, all in the form customarily submitted to each Tenant (the “CAM Reconciliation”). To the extent that Seller has received as of the Closing any monthly or periodic payments of Operating Expenses allocable to periods subsequent to Closing, the same shall be prorated and Buyer shall receive a credit therefor at the Closing. With respect to any monthly or periodic payments of Operating Expenses received by Buyer after the Closing allocable to Seller prior to Closing, Buyer shall promptly pay the same to Seller (subject to the provisions in Section 4.2.1(a) for delinquent rents). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the CAM Reconciliation reveals that Seller has over-collected Operating Expenses such that, if the end of the operating expense year under the Leases was the Closing Date, Seller would be obligated to refund money to the Tenants (an “Over Collection”), rather than collect additional money from the Tenants (an “Under Collection”), said Over Collection shall be paid by Seller to Buyer at the Closing as a settlement statement credit and Buyer shall assume the obligation to pay any such Over Collection to Tenants; provided, in the event of an Under Collection, the amount of the Under Collection shall be paid by Buyer to Seller outside of escrow within 5 Business Days after receipt from the applicable Tenant in connection with the Operating Expense reconciliation process under the Leases. 

4.2.2 The state and county ad valorem property taxes for the year or tax period of Closing. If the actual tax bills have not been issued, then such proration shall be based on such taxes for the prior year or tax period. After the tax bills for the year or tax period of Closing are received by either Buyer or Seller, Buyer and Seller shall adjust such proration, and any amount then owing shall be paid within twenty (20) days of demand by the party entitled thereto. 

4.2.3 Sanitary sewer taxes, assessments and utility charges, if any, to the extent, and only to the extent, such taxes and charges are not required to be paid by any Tenant directly to the utility or governmental authority. With respect to Seller’s accounts for such taxes and charges, to the extent reasonably possible: (i) Seller and Buyer shall request the utility companies to read the meters as of the Proration Date; (ii) Seller shall be responsible for all such utility charges incurred through the Proration Date; (iii) Buyer shall make application to the various companies for the continuation of such services and the establishment of the required accounts in the name of Buyer effective from and after the Proration Date; (iv) all prepaid deposits for utilities shall be refunded to Seller by the utility companies; and (v) it shall be Buyer’s responsibility to make any utility deposits required for the continuation of such services from and after the Proration Date. 

4.2.4 Operating expenses of the Property, including, without limitation, charges under the Surviving Service Contracts, subject to the terms of Section 4.2.1(b) above. 

4.2.5 Reserved 

4.2.6 Tenant improvement expenses (including all hard and soft construction costs, whether payable to the contractor or the Tenant), tenant allowances, moving expenses and other out-of-pocket costs which are the obligation of the landlord under Leases shall be allocated between the parties according to whether such obligations arise in connection with (1) Leases executed as of the date of this Agreement (other than with respect to renewal terms or expansion rights under such Leases properly exercised after the date of this Agreement) (collectively, “Existing TI Obligations”), or (2) Leases or amendments entered into during the pendency of this Agreement and approved by Buyer pursuant to Section 9 and renewals or expansion rights properly exercised after the date of this Agreement (“New TI Obligations”): 

^^Existing TI Obligations. If, by Closing, Seller has not completed and paid in full Existing TI Obligations, then such costs as reasonably agreed by Buyer and Seller shall be withheld from the Purchase Price at Closing, placed in an escrow with the Title Company pursuant to an escrow agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Buyer, and Buyer shall be responsible for completing and paying such Existing TI Obligations. Any funds held in the escrow shall be released to Buyer without any requirement for the consent of Seller and shall be used by Buyer to pay or otherwise satisfy such Existing TI Obligations as and when the same become due and payable. If there are any funds remaining in the escrow after payment of such Existing TI Obligations, such excess shall be paid to Seller; but if the amount in escrow is insufficient for such purpose, Seller shall pay such deficiency to the party to whom the same is owed as and when the same becomes due and payable. 

^^New TI Obligations. Buyer shall be responsible for and shall at Closing assume the obligation to pay all New TI Obligations. At Closing, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the cost of New TI Obligations properly performed and paid for by Seller to the extent such obligations were expressly approved in writing by Buyer pursuant to Section 9 hereof. 

4.2.7 On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall pay in full all leasing commissions due to leasing or other agents for the remaining current term of each Lease (determined as of the Contract Date without regard to any unexercised termination or cancellation right); provided, however, that if any leasing agent will not accept such payment, then Buyer shall receive a credit against the Purchase Price at Closing in an amount equal to the then-unpaid leasing commissions, and Buyer shall assume, in writing, the obligation to pay any such leasing commissions due thereunder after the Closing Date up to the amount of such credit. At Closing, Buyer shall assume the obligation for the payment of any leasing commissions due under the leasing commission agreements identified on Exhibit C hereto which may become due as a result of the renewal of any Lease or the expansion of lease space occupied by any Tenant after Closing pursuant to an express provision set forth in any such Lease or any such commission agreement. 

4.2.8 Either party shall be entitled to a post-Closing adjustment for any incorrect prorations, upon notice from the other party given within one (1) year after Closing. 

4.2.9 Buyer shall cooperate with Seller and use reasonable efforts to collect any delinquent rent due to Seller under the Leases for a period ending 90 days after Closing; provided, however, that Buyer shall have no obligation to bring any legal action to collect such payment. Seller shall have the right to sue delinquent Tenants for delinquent rent so long as Seller does not pursue an eviction or cause a termination of any Lease. To the extent any Tenant has the right under its Lease to audit Seller’s books and records, Seller shall allow such access/audit for such purpose for so long as Tenant has such right under its Lease (without regard to the limitation on survival set forth in Section 4.2.10 below). 

4.2.10 Each party shall have the right after the Closing upon five (5) business days prior written notice to the other party, to review, inspect and audit any and all books, records and other information relating to any proration or adjustment required under this Section 4.2 during mutually agreeable times. Buyer and Seller shall promptly pay to the other party any amount due to the other party as a result of any proration or adjustments to prorations required or made under this Section 4.2. All amounts due hereunder shall be payable no later than twenty (20) days after demand by the payee, and, if such payments duly owing are not then timely paid, then all such amounts shall bear interest at a rate equal to fifteen percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) per annum until such time as all such amounts are paid in full. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 4.2 shall expressly survive the Closing hereunder only for the period of time necessary to achieve final prorations of all amounts due and owing hereunder but in any event no later than one (1) year after the Closing. 

Section 5. Title to the Property. Seller shall convey good and indefeasible fee simple title to the Land and the Improvements to Buyer in the form of the Deed, subject only to the Permitted Title Exceptions. Buyer shall order a current owner’s title insurance commitment or commitments with respect to the Land and Improvements from the Title Insurer, together with legible copies of all of the underlying exception documents shown on Schedule B-2 thereof (the “Title 

Commitment”). Buyer shall have until the Inspection Date by which to examine title to the Property as disclosed by the Title Commitment and Survey and to give written notice to Seller of any objections which Buyer may have. If Buyer fails to give any notice to Seller by such date, Buyer shall be deemed to have approved any title exceptions or defects disclosed in the Title Commitment and Survey. If Buyer does give Seller timely notice of objection to title exceptions or defects disclosed in the Title Commitment and Survey, Seller shall then have the right, but not the obligation, for a period of five (5) days after such notice, to cure or satisfy, or undertake to cure or satisfy by the Closing, such objection. If Seller does not cure or satisfy or undertake by written notice to Buyer to cure or satisfy such objections within the five (5) day period, then Buyer may elect, by written notice to Seller on or before such fifth (5th) day, either to (a) terminate this Agreement, in which case the Earnest Money, less $[[USD Value 7]] to be paid to Seller, shall be returned to Buyer by Escrow Agent, and the parties shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder, except for those which expressly survive any such termination, or (b) waive its objections hereunder and proceed with the transaction pursuant to the remaining terms and conditions of this Agreement. If Buyer fails to give Seller notice of its election by such time, it shall be deemed to have elected the option contained in subparagraph (b) above. If Seller does so cure or satisfy or give notice of its undertaking to cure or satisfy such objection within the time allowed, then this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, subject to Seller so curing such objections, which shall be a condition to Buyer’s obligation to close. Buyer shall have the right at any time to waive any objections that it may have made and, thereby, to preserve this Agreement in full force and effect. Seller agrees not to further voluntarily alter or encumber in any way Seller’s title to the Property after the Contract Date (except for entering into new leases or renewing existing Leases to the extent permitted by Section 9.1 below) without Buyer’s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller shall give Buyer notice of any such proposed alteration or encumbrance and Buyer shall then have five (5) business days in which to elect, by written notice to Seller on or before such fifth (5th) day, either to (i) consent to the change, or (ii) object, in which event Buyer shall set forth and deliver in writing to Seller its reasons for doing so. If Buyer has not given Seller notice of its election by the end of the fifth (5th) day, Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to consent to the change. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5, Seller shall remove all mortgages encumbering the Property, and shall remove or bond over to Buyer’s and the Title Insurer’s reasonable satisfaction any other monetary liens and security interests in or against the Property, to the extent any such mortgages or other monetary liens and security interests arise by, through or under Seller, and are not the result of Buyer’s or Buyer’s agents’ actions. Provided that Buyer obtains a current Title Commitment and current Survey prior to the Inspection Date, then between the Inspection Date and the Closing Date, Buyer may update the Title Commitment and/or Survey and object to any new matters of title or survey not contained in the original Title Commitment and/or Survey other than immaterial matters. If Buyer so objects and Seller elects to undertake to cure such objections (in the manner provided above for the initial title objections), Seller may extend the Closing by up to thirty (30) days to attempt to cure such objections. If Seller is unable or unwilling to cure any such new objection, Buyer shall have the rights as provided above in the event Seller fails to cure or satisfy or undertake to cure or satisfy Buyer’s initial objections, provided Buyer gives Seller notice of its election prior to Closing (as same may be extended). 

Section 6. Limitation on Warranties and Buyer’s Inspection.

Buyer shall have until [[Date 2: Date]] (the “Inspection Date”) in which to make such investigations and studies with respect to the Property as Buyer deems appropriate, and either to terminate this Agreement, in its sole and absolute discretion, if Buyer is not, for any reason satisfied with the Property or to waive its termination right under this Section 6.4. If Buyer fails to give Seller written notice waiving its termination rights hereunder on or before the Inspection Date, then Buyer shall be deemed to have terminated this Agreement, $[[USD Value 7]] of the Earnest Money shall be paid to Seller for the rights granted Buyer hereunder and the balance of the Earnest Money shall be refunded to Buyer by Escrow Agent without any directions from Seller and despite any objections or potential objections by Seller, and the parties shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder, except for those which expressly survive any such termination, and thereafter, Buyer shall promptly provide to Seller, without charge, copies of any reports, surveys, drawings, tests or other written documents obtained by Buyer from third parties with respect to the Property, without any representation or warranty whatsoever. If Buyer delivers written notice waiving its termination rights under this Section 6.4 on or before the Inspection Date, then this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 

^^Survey. The Deed to be delivered by Seller to Buyer at the Closing shall contain the legal descriptions contained in Exhibit B hereto. Buyer shall have the right to obtain prior to the Inspection Date an as-built ALTA/ACSM Surveys of each of the Building B Land and Improvements and the Building H Land and Improvements (collectively, the “Surveys”) and if obtained, shall deliver copies thereto to Seller. If the legal description of either the Building B Land or Building H Land, based on the applicable Survey, differs from the corresponding legal description for such Building’s Land on Exhibit B hereto, Seller will, upon Buyer’s request, also convey the applicable Land to Buyer pursuant to the new survey legal description of such Land, if different from Exhibit B hereto, by quitclaim deed, but if, and only if, such new description of such Land is reasonably acceptable to Seller. 

Section 7. Service Contracts. Seller shall, at or prior to the Closing, terminate all Service Contracts, at Seller’s sole cost and expense, except those Service Contracts designated by Buyer on or before the Inspection Date to be Surviving Service Contracts, which Buyer elects to assume.

^^Miscellaneous. It shall be a condition of Buyer’s obligation to Close that the representations and warranties contained in this Section 8 are true and correct at Closing in all material respects and Seller shall be deemed to have reaffirmed these representations and warranties at Closing. In the event that Seller or Buyer learns that any of said representations or warranties becomes inaccurate between the Contract Date and the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer shall immediately notify the other party of such change. Seller shall then use its good faith efforts to cure such change within thirty (30) days after giving or receiving notice thereof as required herein. The Closing Date shall be automatically extended in order to allow the running of said thirty (30) day period. In the event Seller so cures such change within said thirty (30) day period, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If Seller is unable to cure such change, Buyer may either (a) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller, in which case the Earnest Money shall be returned to Buyer and the parties shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder, except for those which expressly survive such termination, or (b) waive such right to terminate and proceed with the transaction pursuant to the remaining terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event Buyer elects option (b) in the preceding sentence or in the event Buyer elects to Close with the knowledge that a representation or warranty of Seller herein is untrue or incorrect (and it is expressly agreed that Buyer shall be deemed to have knowledge that a representation or warranty is untrue or incorrect if anything contained in the materials delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof renders it so), the representations and warranties shall be deemed to be automatically amended to reflect said change. The representations and warranties contained in this Section 8 shall survive Closing but shall terminate one (1) year after the Closing Date, unless a suit is filed thereupon in a court of competent jurisdiction on or before the expiration of said one (1) year period, as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 12.3 hereof to provide for Seller’s post-closing cure rights. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit Buyer’s remedies under Section 12 if Seller breaches a representation or warranty under this Section 8, after expiration of any applicable notice and cure period. 

Section 9. Leases, Surviving Service Contracts and Guaranties;. 

^^Preservation of Leases, Surviving Service Contracts and Guaranties. After the Contract Date, and to the extent within Seller’s control or discretion, Seller shall not, without Buyer’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, amend, extend or cancel any Lease, Surviving Service Contract or Guaranty; consent to any surrender or release of any Lease or Guaranty; consent to any assignment or sublease under any Lease; or enter into any new Lease or Service Contract that would be binding on the Property post-Closing (other than renewal of Surviving Service Contracts that expire before Closing so long as they can be terminated on no more than 30-days’ notice). Seller shall give Buyer notice of any such contemplated action, and Buyer shall give Seller either its written consent or objection, giving its reasons for any objection, to be given by Buyer on or before the fifth (5th) business day after Buyer’s receipt of such notice. If Buyer fails to give notice of its election within said time period, it shall be deemed to have given its consent to said request. Seller shall, from and after the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, perform and discharge its duties and obligations and otherwise comply with every material covenant and agreement of the landlord or lessor under the Leases and the Surviving Service Contracts, in its ordinary manner of business and within the time limits required thereunder. 

^^Estoppels. 

^^Tenant Estoppel Certificates. Seller shall endeavor to secure and deliver to Buyer, no later than three (3) business days before the Closing Date, Tenant Estoppel Certificates from Tenants under all Leases. The Tenant Estoppel Certificates shall be delivered to the Tenants not later than ten (10) business days after the Contract Date. Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of the Tenant Estoppels for Buyer’s review and comment before delivering the estoppels. Buyer’s obligation to close the transaction contemplated under this Agreement is subject to the condition that as of Closing: (i) estoppel certificates for Tree of Life, Berlin Packaging and Stanpac USA LLC (each a Major Tenant and collectively, the “Major Tenants”) be received; (ii) except for Stanpac vacating its premises, no material default or claim by landlord or tenant shall have arisen under any Lease that was not specifically disclosed in the Rent Roll or actually known to Buyer by the Inspection Date (Stanpac USA LLC is in the process of vacating Building H, but the Lease shall remain in effect. Stanpac’s occupancy of Building H shall not be a condition of Closing and if vacating Stanpac’s space is a default under the Stanpac Lease, Buyer waives its right to terminate this Agreement after the Inspection Date solely as a result of said default) and (iii) between the Inspection Date and the Closing, no Major Tenant has (1) terminated, or given notice of intent to terminate, its Lease, (2) other than Stanpac USA LLC), vacated, abandoned, or ceased operations, or (3) filed for voluntary bankruptcy or be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the form of Tenant Estoppel Certificate on Exhibit H contains a joinder by any Guarantor of each Lease. In the event that a Tenant Estoppel Certificate is returned without the joinder signed by any Guarantor, this fact alone shall not be deemed to cause the Tenant Estoppel Certificate to be disqualified for purposes hereof, unless the Lease specifically requires the Tenant to obtain the Guarantor’s signature. 

If Seller is unable to obtain and deliver sufficient tenant estoppel certificates as required under this Section 9.2, or if the certificates received contain material information or omissions unacceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion and Buyer objects thereto by written notice to Seller within two (2) business days after receipt by Buyer of the objectionable estoppel, but in any event on or before the Closing Date, then Seller will not be in default by reason thereof, and Seller may elect to extend the Closing Date by up to thirty (30) days in order to satisfy the requirement. If Seller still cannot satisfy the requirement at the end of such extended period, then Buyer may, by written notice given to Seller before the Closing, elect to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of the Earnest Money or waive said condition. If Buyer so elects to terminate this Agreement, neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder except those that expressly survive a termination hereof. If no such notice is delivered by Buyer, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived such condition. 

^^Other Estoppels. Buyer shall have the right to request estoppel certificates from owners’ associations, master associations, governmental authorities and other applicable third parties under property owners’ association documents, CCRs, reciprocal easement agreements, development agreements and other instruments, and Seller shall cooperate with Buyer, at no expense or cost to Seller, to obtain said estoppels prior to the Inspection Date, however, receipt of such estoppels shall not be a condition of Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall provide estoppel certificates from any owners’ and/or master associations controlled by Seller or its affiliates (i.e. Pinnacle Industrial Center Owners’ Association, Inc.) in the form(s) provided by Seller to Buyer by e-mail on Friday, [[Date 4: Date]], with reasonable modifications thereto as may be requested by Buyer. 

Section 10. Other Covenants and Conditions of Closing. 

^^Withdrawal from Market. So long as Buyer has not defaulted under this Agreement or committed an anticipatory breach of this Agreement, Seller shall not, directly or indirectly through any officer, director, employee, stockholder, agent, partner, member, manager, affiliate, or otherwise (a) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or other commitment (whether or not legally binding) relating to the Property or the purchase of a material portion of the Property, or transfer (directly or indirectly) of a majority ownership interest in Seller (a “Competing Transaction”), (b) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any person or entity (including any of its officers, directors, partners, members, managers, employees, or agents) relating to any Competing Transaction, or (c) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any other person or entity any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with, assist, participate in, facilitate, or encourage, any effort or attempt by any person or entity to effect a Competing Transaction. 

^^Seller’s Insurance. Until Closing, Seller agrees to continue to maintain insurance regarding the Property consistent with the insurance in place as of the Contract Date subject to any changes required by Seller’s insurance company if renewal occurs prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that (a) Seller shall notify Buyer not less than five (5) days prior to the Inspection Date of any such changes that will take effect prior to the Closing Date, and (b) Seller agrees that no changes shall be made to Seller’s insurance that would reduce its insurance coverage for the Property between the Inspection Date and the Closing Date. 

Section 11. Closing. 

^^Time and Place. Provided that all of the conditions set forth in this Agreement are theretofore fully satisfied or performed, the Closing shall occur through an escrow closing with the Escrow Agent, on a date selected by Buyer by no less than five (5) business days’ prior written notice to Seller, which closing date shall be on or before the fifteenth (15th) business day after the Inspection Date (such date referred to herein as, the “Outside Date”), unless the Outside Date is further extended pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement or as otherwise agreed by Seller and Buyer in writing. If the conditions to Buyer’s obligation to close are not satisfied by the 

Closing Date (as may be extended pursuant to the express terms hereof), the Buyer shall either (i) terminate this Agreement, in which event the Earnest Money shall be refunded to Buyer or (ii) waive the condition and proceed to close; provided, that if the failure of a condition is the result of a default by Seller, Buyer shall also have the right to pursue its remedies pursuant to Section 12.2 hereof.

Seller shall deliver to Buyer or make available at the Property a set of keys to the Property on the Closing Date. The provisions of this Section 11.5 shall survive Closing. 

Section 12. Default and Remedies. 

^^Buyer’s Default. In the event that this transaction fails to Close due to a default by Buyer under the terms of this Agreement, Escrow Agent shall disburse the Earnest Money to Seller, and Seller shall be entitled, as its sole and exclusive remedy hereunder, to retain the Earnest Money as full liquidated damages for such default of Buyer, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and the parties shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder, except for those which expressly survive any such termination. It is hereby agreed that Seller’s damages in the event of a default by Buyer hereunder are uncertain and difficult to ascertain, and that the Earnest Money constitutes a reasonable liquidation of such damages and is intended not as a penalty, but as full liquidated damages. Buyer and Seller covenant not to bring any action or suit challenging this provision or the amount of liquidated damages provided hereunder in the event of such default. This provision shall expressly survive the termination of this Agreement. 

^^Seller’s Default. In the event that this transaction fails to Close due to a default by Seller under the terms of this Agreement, Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedies hereunder shall be either (i) to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund to the Earnest Money, in which event Seller shall reimburse Buyer upon demand for its documented reasonable and actual out of pocket expenses incurred in the investigation of the Property and negotiation of this Agreement, up to but not to exceed $[[USD Value 3: Number]] or (ii) to seek specific performance of Seller’s obligations under this Agreement, without any reduction in the Purchase Price. Buyer shall have no right to seek or recover from Seller any damages resulting from the failure of this transaction to close due to a default by Seller, except for reimbursement of investigation costs as provided above. This provision shall expressly survive the termination of this Agreement. 

^^Seller’s Misrepresentation or Breach of Warranty. In the event of a misrepresentation or breach of warranty by Seller under Section 8 of this Agreement which is first discovered by Buyer after the Closing Date but within one (1) year after the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Seller, in writing, of the specifics of such default. If such misrepresentation or warranty is reasonably capable of cure, Seller shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of Buyer’s notice in which to cure said default (or such longer time if such default cannot be reasonably cured within said sixty (60) day period, but in no event later than one hundred eighty (180) days). If Seller is unable to cure said default within said cure period, Buyer’s sole recourse against Seller shall be to file an action or proceeding against Seller for the actual damages (to the exclusion of any consequential or punitive damages) suffered by Buyer as a direct result of such default. No action or proceeding thereon of any kind whatsoever shall be valid or enforceable, at law or in equity, if not commenced with a court of competent jurisdiction within one (1) year after the Closing Date; provided, however, this one (1) year period shall be extended as required to provide for Seller’s cure rights described above. 

Section 13. Condemnation or Destruction. 

^^Condemnation. Seller hereby represents and warrants that Seller has no knowledge of any action or proceeding pending, instituted or threatened for condemnation or other taking of all or any part of the Property by friendly acquisition or statutory proceeding. Seller agrees to give Buyer immediate written notice of such actions or proceedings that may result in the taking of all or a part of the Property. If, prior to the Closing, all or any material part of the Property is subject to a bona fide threat of condemnation by a body having the power of eminent domain, or is taken by eminent domain or condemnation, or sale in lieu thereof, then Buyer, by written notice to Seller, to be received within fifteen (15) calendar days of Buyer’s receiving Seller’s notice of such threat, condemnation or taking, or by the Closing Date, whichever is earlier, may elect to terminate this Agreement. 

^^Damage or Destruction. If, prior to the Closing, all or any material part of the Property is materially damaged or destroyed by any cause, Seller agrees to give Buyer immediate written notice of such occurrence and the nature and extent of such damage and destruction, and Buyer, by written notice to Seller, to be received within thirty (30) calendar days of Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s notice of such damage or destruction, or by the Closing Date, whichever is earlier, may elect to terminate this Agreement. For the purposes of this Section 13.2, “materially” means (i) requiring more than $[[USD Value 4: Number]] to repair or (ii) entitling Tenants occupying over [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of currently leased space in a Building to terminate their Leases. If the Property is not materially damaged, then Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement. 

^^Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as a result of the provisions of either Section 13.1 or Section 13.2 hereof, Buyer shall be entitled to receive a refund of the Earnest Money from Escrow Agent, whereupon the parties shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder, except for those which expressly survive any such termination. 

^^Awards and Proceeds. If Buyer does not elect to or is not entitled to terminate this Agreement following any notice of a threat of taking or taking by condemnation or notice of damage or destruction to the Property, as provided above, this 

Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the conveyance of the Property contemplated herein, less any interest taken by eminent domain or condemnation, or sale in lieu thereof, shall be effected with no further adjustments. At the Closing, (i) Seller shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer all of Seller’s right, title and interest in and to any awards, payments or insurance proceeds for (a) the actual value of the property lost or destroyed and (b) the cost to repair the remaining Property (in the case of a taking) or the cost to repair the Property, up to but not in excess of the Purchase Price, that have been or may thereafter be made for any such taking, sale in lieu thereof or damage or destruction, to the extent such awards, payments or proceeds shall not have theretofore been used for restoration of the Property pursuant to a plan of restoration approved in writing by Buyer or pursuant to the Leases, (ii) Buyer shall assume the responsibility for the performance or completion of the repair or restoration, as the case may be, at Closing, and (iii) in the case of damage or destruction, (a) Buyer shall receive a credit at Closing in an amount equal to Seller’s deductible under its casualty insurance policy, and (b) Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to collect the insurance proceeds due from Seller’s insurer, which obligation shall survive the Closing; provided, however, that in connection with any such damage or destruction to the Property (and not in connection with any such taking), if Seller shall have commenced restoration of the Property pursuant to a plan of restoration approved in writing by Buyer or pursuant to the Leases prior to Closing, then, at Seller’s option, and in lieu of the assignment, assumption and credit contemplated by parts (i), (ii) and (iii)(a) above, Seller shall have the right to escrow with the Escrow Agent at Closing pursuant to an escrow agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Buyer an amount equal to the reasonably estimated cost to complete such restoration (the “Repair Deposit”), provided that the Repair Deposit need not be in excess of (i) the balance of any unused insurance proceeds received by Seller in connection with such damage or destruction, plus (ii) any deductible under Seller’s casualty insurance policy, and provided, further, that such escrow agreement will provide that (a) any portion of the Repair Deposit remaining in escrow following completion of such restoration by Buyer shall be returned to Seller, and (b) Buyer shall be responsible for the cost of completion of such restoration in excess of the Repair Deposit.

^^Assignment by Buyer. Except as herein expressly provided, Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, assign any of Buyer’s rights hereunder or any part thereof to any person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity. Buyer may assign this Agreement to one or more Affiliates, or to a qualified intermediary pursuant to Section 18.13 without Seller’s consent. If any assignment is made with the consent of Seller or as otherwise expressly provided herein, then the sale contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated in the name of, and by and through the authorized officials of, any such assignee(s), but Buyer shall not be relieved of its obligations under this Agreement. If Buyer assigns this Agreement to more than one assignee, (i) Seller shall transfer the Property through separate Closing Documents for the Building B Property and the Building H Property in the form required by this Agreement, (ii) the parties shall agree to an allocation of the Purchase Price between the Building B 

Property and the Building H Property for tax reporting and accounting purposes at or prior to Closing and (iii) the liability of the multiple Buyers under this Agreement to Seller that survives Closing shall be joint and several. “Affiliate” means (a) an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Buyer or (b) an entity at least a majority of whose economic interest is owned by Buyer; and the term “control” means the power to direct the management of such entity through voting rights or ownership. This Section 14.1 shall expressly survive Closing. 

^^Assignment by Seller. From and after the Contract Date, Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent Buyer may withhold in its sole discretion, assign, transfer, convey, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of all or any part of its right, title and interest in the Property. 

Section 15. Buyer’s Representations and Warranties. 

^^Buyer does hereby represent and warrant to Seller as of the Contract Date and the Closing Date that it is a validly formed limited liability company under the laws of Delaware; that it is in good standing in the state of its organization; that it is not subject to any involuntary proceeding for the dissolution or liquidation thereof; that, in the event it does not terminate this Agreement prior to the Inspection Date, it shall, prior to Closing, have obtained all requisite authorizations to enter into this Agreement with Seller and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and that the parties executing this Agreement on behalf of Buyer are duly authorized to so do. 

^^Buyer does hereby represent and warrant to Seller as of the Contract Date and the Closing Date that Buyer is not, and will not be, a person or entity with whom Seller is restricted from doing business under the USA Patriot Act and/or Anti-Terrorism Laws, including without limitation persons and entities named on the Office of Foreign Asset Control Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. 

Section 16. Broker and Broker’s Commission. 

^^No broker or other real estate agent has participated in this transaction. 

^^Buyer and Seller each warrant and represent to the other that, such party has not employed a real estate broker or agent in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless from any loss or cost suffered or incurred by it as a result of the other’s representation herein being untrue. This Section 16 shall expressly survive the Closing hereunder.

^^No Waiver. Neither the failure of either party to exercise any power given such party hereunder or to insist upon strict compliance by the other party with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver of either party’s right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof.

^^Confidentiality. Buyer covenants and agrees that the terms of this Agreement, as well as the identity of the parties to the transactions contemplated thereby and hereby, and all information concerning the Property (including, without limitation, all information obtained by Buyer prior to the Closing Date) shall be kept in strictest confidence by Buyer prior to the Closing, and thereafter, if the Closing fails to occur for any reason. After the occurrence of the Closing, Buyer may disclose that the transactions contemplated hereby have occurred and that the Property has been sold, but shall not disclose the Purchase Price, except to actual or prospective lenders, investors, shareholders and governmental agencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be construed so as to prohibit Buyer from making (a) a disclosure to members, partners, directors, officers, employees, investors and those agents, contractors, vendors, attorneys, accountants, consultants and potential lenders which need to know in order to assist Buyer in its purchase of the Property, (b) any disclosure required by law, including any such disclosure required by any Federal, state or local governmental agency or court of competent jurisdiction, or rules of any stock exchange applicable to Buyer or its affiliates, (c) any disclosure which is reasonably necessary to protect any such party’s interest in any action, suit or proceeding brought by or against such party and relating to the Property or the subject matter of this Agreement, or (d) provided Buyer has not terminated this Agreement prior the Inspection Date, a press release after the Inspection Date regarding the pending acquisition, the terms of which shall be subject to the approval of Seller (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), which may include the name, location, size, occupancy and tenants of the Property and the Seller’s identity.

Seller covenants and agrees that the terms of this Agreement, as well as the identity of the parties to the transactions contemplated thereby and hereby, shall be kept in strictest confidence by Seller prior to the Closing, and thereafter, if the Closing fails to occur for any reason. After the occurrence of the Closing, Seller may disclose that the transactions contemplated hereby have occurred and that the Property has been sold, but shall not disclose the Purchase Price, except to actual or prospective lenders, investors, shareholders and governmental agencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be construed so as to prohibit Seller from making (a) a disclosure to members, partners, directors, officers, employees, investors and those agents, contractors, vendors, attorneys, accountants, consultants and potential lenders which need to know in order to assist Seller in its sale of the Property, (b) any disclosure required by law, including any such disclosure required by any Federal, state or local governmental agency or court of competent jurisdiction, or rules of any stock exchange applicable to Seller or its affiliates, (c) any disclosure which is reasonably necessary to protect any such party’s interest in any action, suit or proceeding brought by or against such party and relating to the Property or the subject matter of this Agreement, or (d) provided Buyer has not terminated this Agreement prior the Inspection Date, a press release after the Inspection Date regarding the pending sale, the terms of which shall be subject to the approval of Buyer (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), which may include the name, location, size, occupancy and tenants of the Property and the Buyer’s identity. The following information and data shall not be subject to the above confidentiality provisions applicable to Seller: (i) information which is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a wrongful disclosure by Seller, (ii) information which can be demonstrated to be known to Seller prior to its disclosure hereunder; and (iii) information which becomes available to Seller on a non-confidential basis from sources other than Buyer. This Section 18.12 shall expressly survive Closing or a termination of this Agreement. 

^^Like-Kind Exchange. Seller acknowledges that Buyer may desire to acquire the Property as part of a like-kind exchange transaction that would qualify under Sections 1031 and/or 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code for non-recognition treatment. At Buyer’s election, Seller agrees, at Buyer’s expense, to cooperate with Buyer in effecting a qualifying like-kind exchange through a trust or other means determined by Buyer, and Seller shall execute such documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer; provided: (a) Seller shall have no liability under such documents, and (b) such documents contain no language or provisions which would cause Seller to become part of the chain of title with respect to any other property which is part of the exchange. Seller makes no representations to Buyer regarding qualification of the exchange under Section 1031 and/or 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code and Seller shall not be liable to Buyer in any manner whatsoever if the exchange completed in accordance with this paragraph should not qualify for any reason under Sections 1031 and/or 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code.

All third party, out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller in assisting Buyer in the foregoing activities shall be paid for by Buyer. All books, records and materials shall be provided without representation or warranty as to accuracy or completeness or otherwise, except as provided in the Audit Letter. All such activities described in this Section 20 shall be conducted at Seller’s or its agent’s place of business in a commercially reasonable fashion during normal business hours. This Section 20 shall expressly survive Closing. 

Section 21. Release and Limitation on Liability. 

^^Without limiting the above, and subject to (and expressly excluding) the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement and the Closing Documents, Buyer on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns waives its right to recover from, and forever releases and discharges, Seller, Seller’s affiliates, the partners, trustees, beneficiaries, shareholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees and agents and representatives of each of them, and their respective heirs, successors, personal representatives and assigns (collectively, the “Seller Related Parties”), from any and all demands, claims, legal or administrative proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, penalties, fines, liens, judgments, costs or expenses whatsoever (including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys’ fees and disbursements), whether direct or indirect, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, that may arise on account of or in any way be connected with (i) the physical condition of the Property including, without limitation, all structural and seismic elements, all mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and other systems, the environmental condition of the Property and the presence of Hazardous Substances on, under or about the Property, or (ii) any law or regulation applicable to the Property, including, without limitation, any Hazardous Substance Law and any other federal, state or local law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (including the foregoing release), (a) Buyer shall have the right to use all available means to defend against government and third-party claims by alleging that Seller (or someone acting on Seller’s behalf or for whom Seller is responsible) is liable (in whole or in part) for such claims and, in conjunction therewith, to assert, file or otherwise proceed with one or more contribution actions, cross- or counter-claim or other action or claim against Seller, and Buyer has no obligation to indemnify Seller for governmental or third party claims asserted before or after the Closing as a result of any act or omission taken or failed to be taken by or on Seller’s behalf prior to the Closing, (b) the release shall not apply to claims by tenants (1) who did not deliver an estoppel certificate to Buyer and (2) who allege defaults by Seller, as landlord, related to the period of Seller’s ownership of the Property, (c) the release shall not apply to third-party tort claims relating to the Property and occurring during Seller’s ownership of the Property, and (d) the release shall not apply to fraud by Seller or any Seller Related Parties. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, after the Closing: (a) the maximum aggregate liability of Seller, and the maximum aggregate amount which may be awarded to and collected by Buyer for any breach of any representation or warranty by Seller under this Agreement or any Closing Document (excluding, however, any warranty of title in the Deed) shall under no circumstances whatsoever exceed Seven Hundred Seventy Thousand Two Hundred Fifty and No/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 5: Number]]); and (b) no claim by Buyer alleging a breach by Seller of any representation, warranty and/or covenant of Seller contained herein or in any of the Closing Documents may be made, and Seller shall not be liable for any judgment in any action based upon any such claim, unless and until such claim, either alone or together with any other claims by Buyer alleging a breach by Seller of any such representation, warranty and/or covenant is for an aggregate amount in excess of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 6: Number]]) (the “Floor Amount”), in which event Seller’s liability respecting any final judgment concerning such claim or claims shall be for the entire amount thereof, subject to the limitation on liability for a breach of representations and warranties set forth in clause (a) above; provided, however, that if any such final judgment is for an amount that is less than or equal to the Floor Amount, then Seller shall have no liability with respect thereto. The limitation under Section 21.2(a) shall not apply to (i) any warranty of title in the Deed; however, Buyer agrees that it shall pursue the Title Insurer under its title policy(ies) with respect to any claim relating to the warranty of title under the Deed prior to bringing an action against Seller, (ii) any fraud by Seller or any Seller Related Parties, or (iii) attorneys’ fees incurred by Buyer if Buyer is the prevailing party in any action or proceeding based on a breach by Seller of any representation or warranty. The limitation under Section 21.2(b) shall not apply to any post-closing true-ups or reconciliations under Section 4.2 of this Agreement. Seller agrees to maintain unencumbered assets in an amount not less than $[[USD Value 5]] for a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date. 

^^This Section 21 shall expressly survive Closing.

\centered **ESCROW AGREEMENT** 

**THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT** (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into this day of [[Date 5: Date]] by and among **[[Seller]]** (“Seller”), **[[Buyer]]** (“Buyer”), and **FIDELITY NATIONAL TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY** (“Escrow Agent”). 

**WHEREAS**, Seller and Buyer have entered into that certain Agreement for Purchase and Sale of Property (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated as of November , 2010, for the sale and purchase of that certain real property described therein; all terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Purchase Agreement; and 

**WHEREAS**, Buyer and Seller desire to have Escrow Agent hold the Earnest Money in escrow, as required by the Purchase Agreement and pursuant to the terms hereof. 

**NOW, THEREFORE**, in consideration of Ten Dollars ($10.00) and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency whereof are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby covenant and agree as follows: 

^Buyer and Seller appoint **FIDELITY NATIONAL TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY** as Escrow Agent hereunder. 

^Buyer will deliver and deposit with Escrow Agent the amount of $, representing the Initial Deposit as required by Section 3 of the Purchase Agreement. If the Purchase Agreement is not terminated by the Inspection Date in accordance with Section 6.4 of the Purchase Agreement, Buyer will deliver and deposit with Escrow Agent the amount of $, representing the Additional Deposit. The Escrow Agent agrees to immediately deposit the Earnest Money in an interest-bearing account in a national banking association and to hold and disburse the same, together with any interest earned thereon, as required by the Purchase Agreement. 

^If the Purchase Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.4, Escrow Agent shall pay the $[[USD Value 7]] of the Earnest Money to Seller and the balance of the Earnest Money to Buyer one business day following the termination of the Purchase Agreement pursuant to Section 6.4 thereof (as long as the current investment can be liquidated in one day) and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate. Only for a termination of the Purchase Agreement in accordance with Section 6.4 thereof, no notice to Escrow Agent from Seller shall be required for the release of the Earnest Money to Buyer by Escrow Agent. The Earnest Money (less the $[[USD Value 7]] payable to Seller) shall be released and 

\centered a-1 

delivered to Buyer from Escrow Agent upon Escrow Agent’s confirmation that the requirements in Section 6.4 of the Purchase Agreement have been satisfied, despite any objection or potential objection by Seller. Seller agrees it shall have no right to bring any action against Escrow Agent which would have the effect of delaying, preventing, or in any way interrupting Escrow Agent’s delivery of the Earnest Money to Buyer pursuant to this paragraph for a termination of the Purchase Agreement in accordance with Section 6.4 thereof (but not otherwise), any remedy of Seller being against Buyer, not Escrow Agent. 

^Upon the Closing Date, Escrow Agent shall apply the Earnest Money, together with any accrued interest thereon, to the Purchase Price as required by the Purchase Agreement. 

^Within two (2) business days after written notification from both Buyer and Seller that the sale contemplated by the Purchase Agreement shall not take place, Escrow Agent shall deliver the Earnest Money as required by the Purchase Agreement. 

^Buyer and Seller hereby covenant and agree that Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss, cost or damage which it may incur as a result of serving as Escrow Agent hereunder, except for any loss, cost or damage arising out of Escrow Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Accordingly, Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability with respect to (a) any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith upon advice of its counsel, given with respect to any questions relating to its duties and responsibilities hereunder, or (b) any action taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon any document, including any written notice of instruction provided for herein or in the Purchase Agreement, not only as to the due execution and the validity and effectiveness thereof, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by proper person or persons in conformity with the provisions of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements actually incurred, which may be imposed upon and incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with its serving as Escrow Agent hereunder. In the event of a dispute between Buyer and Seller, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to tender unto the registry or custody of any court of competent jurisdiction in Dallas County, Texas all money or property in Escrow Agent’s hands held under the terms of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, together with such legal pleadings as it deems appropriate, and thereupon shall be discharged of its obligations hereunder and under the Purchase Agreement.

Dear Sirs: 

We are writing at your request to confirm our understanding that your audit of the Statement of Revenue and Certain Expenses for the year ended , 20__, was made for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether the statement of operating income presents fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations of **[INSERT NAME AND ADDRESS OF PROJECT]** (the “Project”) in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

The following representations are made exclusively to the auditor of the Project and cannot be relied upon or inure to the benefit of any other person or entity without our prior written consent. In connection with your **[INSERT DATE]** audit we confirm, to our actual knowledge, with respect to our daily operations and without independent inquiry or investigation, the following representations made during your audit:

^Notices of violations of laws or regulations, the effects of which should be considered for disclosure in the financial statements or as a basis for recording a loss contingency.

^Material events that have occurred subsequent to , 2010 that would require material adjustment to the statement of operating income.
