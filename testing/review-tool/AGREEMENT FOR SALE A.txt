In no event shall Seller be obligated to deliver or make available to Buyer any of Seller's internal memoranda, attorney-client privileged materials or appraisals of the Property, if any.

Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain tenant estoppel certificates ("**Estoppels**") from all of the Tenants no later than the Feasibility Date. Seller agrees to deliver the form of the tenant estoppel certificate attached hereto as **Exhibit** B to the Tenants and request that each Tenant execute and return an Estoppel no later than the Feasibility Date. Buyer hereby acknowledges its understanding and acceptance of the fact that one or more of the Tenants may insist upon using its own form of Estoppel, including any form of estoppel attached to its Lease, which may or may not include the same categories of information set forth in Exhibit B.

Under no circumstances shall the right of entry granted herein be interpreted as delivery of possession of the Property prior to Closing.

All prepaid deposits for utilities shall be refunded to Seller at the time of Closing by the utility companies, and it shall be Buyer's responsibility to make any utility deposits required for service.

^^**Reproration and Post-Closing Adjustments**. In the event that any adjustments or prorations cannot be apportioned or adjusted at Closing by reason of the fact that final or liquidated amounts have not been ascertained, or are not available as of such date, the parties hereto agree to apportion or adjust such items on the basis of their best estimates of the amounts at Closing. In the event of any omission or mathematical error on the closing statement, or if the prorations, apportionments and computations shall prove to be incorrect for any reason, the same shall be promptly adjusted when determined and the appropriate party paid any monies owed; provided that any such adjustment must occur prior to Seller being dismissed by the Court and is limited to the extent of funds Seller then possesses as receiver for the Property. The provisions of this Section shall survive Closing.

^^**Costs and Expenses**. Seller shall pay all transfer taxes. Buyer shall pay all escrow fees, all costs of recording, title search, examination and out-of-pocket fees of the Title Company, the title insurance premium for a CLTA owner's title insurance policy to be issued to Buyer by the Title Company, the costs of any extended coverage and endorsements to the owner's title insurance policy requested or required by Buyer, and the cost of any survey obtained by Buyer. Attorneys' fees, consulting fees, and other due diligence expenses shall be borne by the party incurring such expense. The provisions of this S ection shall survive the Closing.

^\centered **TITLE**

^^**Evidence of and Encumbrances upon Title**. Seller has ordered the Title Commitment and upon receipt thereof shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered the Title Commitment, together with copies of all exceptions reflected therein, to Buyer. The Title Commitment shall be the basis upon which Buyer reviews the status of title to the Land. Buyer may file written objections to exceptions contained in the Title Commitment on or before the Feasibility Date; provided, however, the following shall be deemed "**Acceptable Encumbrances**" and Buyer shall not have the right to obje ct to Acceptable Encumbrances:

^^Real property taxes and assessments for the year in which the sale and [[Address 20: Address]] closed, which shall be prorated as provided for herein;

^^Zoning and other regulatory laws and ordinances affecting the Property; and

^^Any matters that are approved in writing by Buyer or deemed approved by Buyer in accordance with this Agreement.

If Buyer timely files a written objection to any such item other than an Acceptable Encumbrance, then Seller shall have the right but not the obligation to use reasonable diligence to remove, discharge or correct such liens, encumbrances or objections and shall have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of notice thereof in which to do so (and only if Seller elects to so cure the Closing Date shall be extended). Seller shall not in any event be obligated to pay any sums of money (other than to Lender in accordance with Section 3.2(b) above to cause the Loan documents of record to be satisfied) or to litigate any matter in order to remove, discharge or correct any lien, encumbrance or objection. If Seller shall be unwilling or unable to remove or discharge such other liens, encumbrances or objections within such period, then Buyer may, at its option, no later than ten (10) days after Seller notifies Buyer of Seller's unwillingness or inability, either terminate this Agreement or accept title in its then existing condition without reduction of the [[Address 6: Address]]. If Buyer shall elect to terminate this Agreement, the Deposit shall be delivered to Buyer, this Agreement shall terminate, and thereafter neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder except that the parties shall remain obligated with respect to the indemnities and obligations of this Agreement which specifically survive termination. If Buyer fails to give written notice of objection to Seller on or before the Feasibility Date, all matters reflected on the Title Commitment shall be deemed to be Acceptable Encumbrances.

^^**Survey**. Prior to the Feasibility Date, Buyer may cause a survey of the Real Property to be prepared or updated at Buyer's sole cost and expense. Any such survey shall be certified to Buyer, Seller and the Title Company. If any matters not acceptable to Buyer are shown, Buyer may give written notice of objection to Seller prior to the Feasibility Date, in which case any such matter shall be treated in the same manner as a title defect pursuant to Section 4.1 above. If, however, Buyer fails to obtain a survey or updated survey or if Buyer obtains a survey or updated survey but fails to give written notice of objection prior to the Feasibility Date, all matters of survey shall be deemed approved by Buyer and shall constitute Acceptable Encumbrances.

^^**Updated Title Commitment**. On or before the Closing Date, Buyer and/or Seller may cause the Title Company to update the Title Commitment. If the updated Title Commitment contains exceptions that do not constitute Acceptable Encumbrances, Buyer may file written objection thereto prior to the completion of the Closing. If Buyer timely and properly files written objection to any such other item, then same shall be treated in the same manner as a title defect pursuant to Section 4.1 above. If the updated Title Commitment contains no exceptions other than those reflected on the Title Commitment and other Acce ptable Encumbrances or if Buyer fails to give written notice of objection to Seller prior to completion of Closing, all matters reflected on the updated Title Commitment shall be deemed Acceptable Encumbrances, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and Buyer shall be obligated to complete the transaction as required by this Agreement.

^^**Title Policy.** At Closing and as a condition to Buyer's obligation to close, the Title Company shall issue or be irrevocably and unconditionally committed to issue to Buyer an owner's title insurance policy, insuring that title is vested in Buyer as the fee simple owner of the Land in the full amount of the [[Address 10: Address]] subject to only the Acceptable Encumbrances.

^\centered **ESCROW AND CLOSING**

^^**Escrow Instructions**. Upon execution of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall deposit an executed counterpart of this Agreement with the Title Company, and this Agreement shall serve as the instructions to the Title Company as the escrow holder for consummation of the [[Address 21: Address]] contemplated hereby. Seller and Buyer agree to execute such reasonable additional and supplementary escrow instructions as may be appropriate to enable the Title Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any supplementary escrow instru ctions, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

^^**Condition Precedent to Closing**. Buyer acknowledges that it is a condition precedent to Seller's obligations hereunder that Receiver and Lender cause the Court to enter an order approving this Agreement, the sale of the Property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Closing by Seller on the terms of this Agreement (collectively, the "**Approval Order**"). Provided this Agreement is not terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the Feasibility Date, Receiver and Lender shall use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to either (a) jointly file with Owner a motion for such Approval Order or (b) file a motion, and cause Owner to consent to Receiver's and Lender's motion, for such Approval Order, with the Court. After the filing of the motion for the Approval Order, Receiver and Lender shall diligently pursue such Approval Order and deliver to Buyer, immediately upon receipt thereof, a copy of the signed Approval Order. If the Approval Order has not received by Receiver and Lender and delivered to Buyer at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Closing Date shall be extended until 2:00 p.m. on the date that is the earlier of ten (10) Business Days after Receiver's and Lender's receipt of the Order and delivery to Buyer as provided herein or thirty (30) days after the Closing Date (the "**Extended Closing Date**"); provided, however, if, despite Receiver's and Lender's commercially reasonable good faith efforts, Owner will not join in or consent to Receiver's and Lender's motion for the Approval Order and instead has objected to the entry of the Approval Order and Receiver and Lender alone have moved for the Approval Order and, notwithstanding Owner's objection, the Approval Order is received, the parties agree that the Extended Closing Date shall be the date thirty one (31) days after the Approval Order has been entered to allow the appeal period for such Approval Order to have expired as required by the Title Company; provided, further, however, that Closing shall not occur until Seller has given Buyer not less than two (2) Business Days prior written notice confirming the actual calendar date of the Extended Closing Date. If the Approval Order denies approval of this Agreement, the Approval Order has not been received by thirty (30) days after the Closing Date or if the Approval Order was obtained without Owner's joinder in or consent to the motion for same and thereafter Owner timely files an appeal of the Order Approval, this Agreement shall be terminated, the Deposit shall be released to Buyer and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder except, however, Buyer and Seller shall remain obligated with respect to the indemnities and obligations herein which specifically survive termination.

Buyer acknowledges that if any circumstances arise after Seller's execution of this Agreement resulting in any further orders of the Court being required which would result in Seller not being able to obtain the Order, then Seller shall notify Buyer of such circumstances and shall terminate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement without any liability of Seller to Buyer.

Lender joins in this Agreement solely for purposes of evidencing its agreement to this Section and Section 3.2(b) hereof.

Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, the Title Company is hereby designated as the "**Reporting Person**" for the transaction pursuant to Section 6045(e) of the United States Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. If requested in writing by either party, the Title Company shall confirm its status as the "Reporting Person" in writing, which such writing shall comply with the requirements of Section 6045(e) of the United States Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

^^**Possession**. Possession of the Property, subject to the Leases, shall be surrendered to Buyer at the Closing.

^\centered **ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**

Buyer hereby specifically releases Seller from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, fines, charges, damages, injuries, penalties, response costs, and expenses of any and every kind whatsoever (whether known or unknown) relating to the presence on or under, or the escape, seepage, leakage, spillage, discharge, emission or release of any Hazardous Materials on the Property, if any, including without limitation, any residual contamination, in, on, under or about the Property or affecting natural resources, whether prior to or following Closing, and also including, without limitation, any liability due to asbestos-containing materials at the Property.

Upon such termination and delivery of copies or originals of all Due Diligence Reports, the Deposit shall be delivered to Buyer and neither party shall have any further rights or obl igations hereunder, except, however, that Buyer shall remain obligated with respect to the indemnities and obligations herein which specifically survive termination.

Upon payment by the insurance company, the Buyer’s Proceeds shall be disbursed to Buyer and the Excess Proceeds, if any, shall be disbursed to Seller. Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to the amount of the Net Proceeds that will be available from the insura nce company in connection with any such casualty, including, without limitation, whether Buyer will be entitled to the actual cash value or the replacement cost of the Property. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the Closing.

A waiver of any breach under this Agreement by any party, unless otherwise expressly declared in writing, shall not be a continu ing waiver or waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or other provision of this Agreement.

For the period of time commencing on the Execution Date and continuing through the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall, from time to time, upon reasonable advance notice from Buyer, provide Buyer and its representatives, agents and employees with access to all financial and other information pertaining to the period of Receiver’s operation of the Property, which information is relevant and reasonably necessary, in the opinion of Buyer or its outside third party accountants (the “**Accountants**”), to enable Buyer and its Accountants to prepare financial statements in compliance with any and or all of (a) Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “**Commission** ”); (b) any other rule issued by the Commission and applicable to Buyer; and (c) any registration statement, report or disclosure statement filed with the Commission by, or on behalf of Buyer; provided, however, that in any such event(s), Buyer shall reimburse Seller for those reasonable third party, out-of-pocket costs and expenses that Seller incurs in order to comply with the foregoing requirement. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the following is a representative description of the information and documentation that Buyer and the Accountants may require in order to comply with (a), (b) and (c) above. Seller shall provide the following information and documentation, all only to the extent in Receiver's possession or control, on a per-building basis, if available (capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings as ascribed to such terms in the Agreement to which this Exhibit is attached):

The provisions of the foregoing information shall be for informational purposes only, shall not be deemed to be representations or warranties under this Agreement, and shall not expose Seller or Receiver to any liability on account thereof.
