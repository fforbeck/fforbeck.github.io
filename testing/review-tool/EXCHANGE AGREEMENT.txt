NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree as follows:

^^The obligation of the Investor to consummate the Exchange is also subject to the fulfillment (or waiver by the Investor) at or prior to the Closing of each of the following conditions: 

^^^the Company shall have obtained an exception in writing pursuant to Section 312.05 (Financial Viability Exception) of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual from the shareholder approval policy set forth in Section 312.03 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual in respect of the issuances by the Company of the Capital Securities, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Capital Securities (the “Underlying Common Shares”), the Amended Warrant and the Warrant Shares as contemplated by this Agreement, and at least ten days shall have passed since the Company sent its shareholders the letter required by Section 312.05 of the Listed Company Manual; 

^^^(A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III of this Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as though made on and as of the Closing Date (other than representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of another date, which representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all respects as of such other date) and (B) the Company shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing; 

^^^the Investor shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by a senior executive officer certifying to the effect that the conditions set forth in Section 1.2(d)(ii) have been satisfied; 

^^^the Company shall have duly adopted and filed with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico a Certificate of Designations, having the effect of an amendment to its articles of incorporation (“Charter”), in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex B (the “New Certificate of Designations”) and such filing shall have been accepted; 

^^^the Company shall have executed the Amended Warrant and delivered such executed Amended Warrant to the Investor or its designee(s); 

^^^the Company shall have delivered certificates in proper form or, with the prior consent of the Investor, evidence in book-entry form, evidencing the Capital Securities to the Investor or its designee(s); 

^^^the Company shall have delivered to the Investor written opinions from outside counsel to the Company, addressed to the Investor and dated as of the Closing Date, in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex C; and

^**Interpretation****.** When a reference is made in this Agreement to “Recitals,” “Articles,” “Sections,” “Annexes” or “Schedules” such reference shall be to a Recital, Article or Section of, or Annex or Schedule to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The terms defined in the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice versa. References to “herein”, “hereof”, “hereunder” and the like refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or provision, unless the context requires otherwise. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed followed by the words “without limitation.” No rule of construction against the draftsperson shall be applied in connection with the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement, as this Agreement is the product of negotiation between sophisticated parties advised by counsel. All references to “$” or “dollars” mean the lawful currency of the United States of America. Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, all references to any statute, rule or regulation are to the statute, rule or regulation as amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of statutes, include any rules and regulations promulgated under the statute) and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation include any successor to the section. References to a “business day” shall mean any day except Saturday, Sunday and any day on which banking institutions in the State of New York generally are authorized or required by law or other governmental actions to close. 

\centered **EXCHANGE** 

^**Exchange; Dividend Exchange****.** 

^^On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, (i) the Company agrees to issue the Capital Securities to the Investor in exchange for [[Shares 1]] shares of the Series F Shares, and the Investor agrees to deliver to the Company the Series F Shares in exchange for the Capital Securities, and (ii) the Company and the Investor mutually agree to amend and restate the Old Warrant to reflect the terms and conditions of the Amended Warrant. 

^^Simultaneously with the Exchange, the Company shall deliver to the Investor pursuant to the Dividend Exchange the number of shares of Capital Securities (rounded to the nearest whole number) determined by dividing the total amount of the cash payment of accrued and unpaid dividends that would otherwise be payable to the Investor (rounded to the nearest whole cent) by $[[USD Value 2: Number]] representing the liquidation amount per share of the Capital Securities. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Closing Date were [[Date 4: Date]], the total amount of the cash payment of accrued and unpaid dividends that would otherwise be payable to the Investor (rounded to the nearest whole cent) would equal $[[USD Value 3: Number]] and the number of shares of Capital Securities issuable to Treasury in exchange for such amount would equal [[Shares 3: Number]] shares. The issuance of any such shares of Capital Securities in such amount shall constitute full payment of the cash dividends that would otherwise have been payable under the Series F Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

^**Exchange Documentation****.** Settlement of the Exchange will take place on the Closing Date, at which time the Investor will cause delivery of the Series F Shares to the Company or its designated agent and the Company will cause delivery of the Capital Securities to the Investor or its designated agent.

To the extent that EESA and/or the Compensation Regulations are amended or otherwise change during the Relevant Period in a manner that requires changes to then-existing Benefit Plans, or that requires other actions, the Company and its Affiliates shall effect such changes to its or their Benefit Plans, and take such other actions, as promptly as practicable after it has actual knowledge of such amendments or changes in order to be in compliance with this Section 4.5(a) (and shall be deemed to be in compliance for a reasonable period to effect such changes).

Part 30, or any other guidance or regulations under the EESA and the applicable requirements of the Exchange Agreement by and among the Company and the Treasury dated as of [[Date 1]] (such requirements, the “Limitations”). 

^acknowledge that the Limitations may require modification or termination of the employment, compensation, bonus, incentive, severance, retention and other benefit plans, arrangements, policies and agreements (including so-called “golden parachute” agreements), whether or not in writing, that I may have with the Company or my employer or in which I may participate as they relate to the period the United States holds any equity or debt securities of the Company acquired through a Program or for any other period applicable under such Program or Limitations, as the case may be, and I hereby consent to all such modifications. 

This waiver includes all claims I may have under the laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction (whether or not in existence as of the date hereof) related to the requirements imposed by the Limitations, including without limitation a claim for any compensation or other payments or benefits I would otherwise receive, any challenge to the process by which the Limitations are or were adopted and any tort or constitutional claim about the effect of these Limitations on my employment relationship and I hereby agree that I will not at any time initiate, or cause or permit to be initiated on my behalf, any such claim against the United States, the Company, my employer or their respective directors, officers, employees or agents in or before any local, state, federal or other agency, court or body.
