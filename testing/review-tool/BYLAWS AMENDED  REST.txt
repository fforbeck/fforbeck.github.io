^Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of subparagraph 5.2 (a)(2) of this bylaw to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the board of directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased board of directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, a stockholder’s notice required by this bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation. 

^^General.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this bylaw and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this bylaw, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded and not transacted. 

^For purposes of this bylaw, “public announcement” shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

^^^^^ 
^Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this bylaw, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this bylaw; provided, however, that any references in these bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to subparagraph 5.2(a)(1)(C) or subparagraph 5.2(b) of this bylaw. Nothing in this bylaw shall be deemed to affect any rights (A) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (B) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock if and to the extent provided for under law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws.

To be eligible for nomination by a stockholder for election or reelection as a director of the corporation, a person must deliver (in accordance with the time periods prescribed for delivery of notice under subsection 5.2) to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation a written questionnaire with respect to the background and qualification of such person and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made (which questionnaire shall be provided by the Secretary upon written request) and a written representation and agreement (in the form provided by the Secretary upon written request) that such person (a) is not and will not become a party to (1) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director of the corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question (a “Voting Commitment”) that has not been disclosed to the corporation or (2) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such person’s ability to comply, if elected as a director of the corporation, with such person’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, (b) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed therein, and (c) in such person’s individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if elected as a director of the corporation, and will comply with all applicable publicly disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the corporation. 

^Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders may be held for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called only by the chairman of the board, by the president, or by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire board of directors. At a special meeting of the stockholders, no business shall be transacted and no corporate action shall be taken other than that stated in the notice of the meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation’s notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (b) provided that the board of directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who (i) is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this bylaw and at the time of the special meeting, (ii) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (iii) complies with the notice procedures set forth in these bylaws as to such nomination. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the board of directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation’s notice of meeting, if the stockholder’s notice required by subparagraph 5.2 (a)(2) of these bylaws with respect to any nomination (including the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by subparagraph 5.3 of these bylaws) shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier 

^^^^^ 
than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such special meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such special meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such special meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of a special meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above. 

The “call” and the “notice” of any such meeting shall be deemed to by synonymous. 

^Voting. At all meetings of stockholders, every stockholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person, or by proxy appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such stockholder and bearing a date not more than three years prior to said meeting, unless said instrument shall provide for a longer period. Unless otherwise provided by the certificate of incorporation or resolutions adopted by the board of directors in accordance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware, each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote at such meeting registered in his name on the books of the corporation. At all meetings of stockholders the voting may be otherwise than by ballot, including the election of directors, except that, unless otherwise provided by the certificate of incorporation, any qualified voter may demand a vote by ballot on any matter, in which event such vote shall be taken by ballot. 

Subject to subparagraph 5.2 above, stockholders shall elect directors of the corporation at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, by the holders of outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote for the election of directors; provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at any time before the election, the stockholders shall instead elect the directors by a plurality vote. 

^Quorum. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of any business, except as otherwise provided by law, by the certificate of incorporation, or by these bylaws. Every decision of a majority in amount of stock of such quorum shall be valid as a corporate act, except in those specific instances in which a larger vote is required by law or by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws. 

If the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote are not present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting of stockholders, the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall have power successively to adjourn the meeting from time to time to a specified time and place, without notice to anyone other than by announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present in person or by proxy. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present in person or by proxy, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting which was adjourned. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Written or printed notice of each meeting of the stockholders, whether annual or special, stating the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes thereof, shall be given to each stockholder of record of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting, either personally or by mail, not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when it is deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon addressed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. 

^Stockholder Action; How Taken. No action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation may be taken without a meeting, and the power of stockholders to consent in writing, without a meeting, to the taking of any action is specifically denied.

\centered Board of Directors 

^Management. The property, business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors. The number of directors of the corporation (including directors to be elected by the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock voting separately as a class or classes) shall be seven (7). As used in these bylaws, the terms “whole board” or “whole board of directors” mean the total number of directors which the corporation would have if there were no vacancies. In addition to the powers and authorities by these bylaws and the certificate of incorporation expressly conferred upon it, the board of directors may exercise all such powers of the corporation, and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. 

^Classes. The members of the whole board of directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any Preferred Stock or series thereof, shall be divided into three (3) classes (to be designated as Class I, Class II and Class III), with the term of office of one class expiring each year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the corporation, the terms of the director or directors elected by such holders shall expire at the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. Subject to the foregoing, at each annual meeting of stockholders, the successors to the class of directors whose term shall then expire shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting and until their respective successors shall be elected and qualified or until their respective earlier resignation or removal. 

^Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships. Except for directorships created pursuant to paragraph FOURTH of the certificate of incorporation relating to the rights of holders of Preferred Stock or any series thereof, and except for vacancies in such directorships, any vacancies in the board of directors for any reason, and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than quorum, or by a sole remaining director, unless it is otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such directors shall have been chosen and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. 

^Removal of Directors. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these bylaws (and notwithstanding the fact that some lesser percentage may be specified by law or these bylaws), any director or the entire board of directors of the corporation may be removed at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of eighty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) or more of the Total Voting Power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, considered for this purpose as one class (for purposes of this paragraph 17, each share of the Voting Stock shall have the number of votes granted to it pursuant to paragraph FOURTH of the corporation’s certificate of incorporation). For the purposes of this paragraph 17, (i) the term “Total Voting Power” shall mean the aggregate of all votes of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock; and (ii) the term “Voting Stock” shall mean the shares of all classes of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote on removal of any director or the entire board of directors in the manner provided in this paragraph 17 (except that if the next succeeding sentence is operative, then the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall not be considered “Voting Stock” for purposes of this paragraph 17). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the corporation, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 17 shall not apply with respect to the director or directors elected by such holders of Preferred Stock. 

^^^^^ 
As used in these bylaws, the term “for cause” is hereby exclusively defined and limited to mean conviction of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction where such conviction is no longer subject to direct appeal, or an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction of liability for negligence, or misconduct, in the performance of the director’s duty to the corporation in a matter of substantial importance to the corporation, where such adjudication is no longer subject to direct appeal. 

^Notification of Nominations. Subject to the rights of holders of Preferred Stock, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the board of directors or a proxy committee appointed by the board of directors or by any stockholder entitled to generally vote in the election of directors at the meeting of the stockholders at which directors will be elected. However, any such stockholder may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of such stockholder complies with the requirements set forth in paragraph 5 of these bylaws. The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure. 

^Meetings of the Newly Elected Board  Notice. The first meeting of the members of the board of directors after each election with respect to a class of directors shall be held (i) at such time and place either within or without the State of Delaware as shall be suggested or provided by resolution of the stockholders at the meeting at which such election was held with respect to a class of directors, and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present, (ii) if not so suggested or provided for by resolution of the stockholders or if a quorum shall not be present, at such time and place as shall be consented to in writing by a majority of the newly elected directors, provided that written or printed notice of such meeting shall be given to each of the other directors in the same manner as provided in paragraph 22 of these bylaws with respect to the giving of notice for special meetings of the board except that it shall not be necessary to state the purpose of the meeting in such notice, or (iii) regardless of whether or not the time and place of such meeting shall be suggested or provided for by resolution of the stockholders, at such time and place as shall be consented to in writing by all of the newly elected directors. 

Every director of the corporation, upon his election, shall qualify by accepting the office of director, and his attendance at, or his written approval of the minutes of, any meeting of the board subsequent to his election shall constitute his acceptance of such office; or he may execute such acceptance by a separate writing, which shall be placed in the minute book. 

^Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such times and places either within or without the State of Delaware as shall from time to time be fixed by resolution adopted by the whole board of directors. Any business may be transacted at a regular meeting.

Special meetings of the board of directors may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president or the secretary, or by any two (2) or more of the directors.

^Notice of Special Meetings. Written or printed notice of each special meeting of the board, stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes thereof, shall be mailed to each director addressed to him at his residence or usual place of business at least three (3) days before the day on which the meeting is to be held, or shall be sent to him by telegram, or delivered to him personally, at least two (2) days before the day on which the meeting is to be held. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when it is deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon 

^^^^^ 
addressed to the director at his residence or usual place of business. If given by telegraph, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when it is delivered to the telegraph company. The notice may be given by any officer having authority to call the meeting. “Notice” and “call” with respect to such meetings shall be deemed to be synonymous. Any meeting of the board of directors shall be a legal meeting without any notice thereof having been given if all directors shall be present. 

^Meetings by Conference Telephone or Similar Communications Equipment. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the board of directors of the corporation, or any committee designated by the board, may participate in a meeting of the board or committee by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting by that means shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 

^Quorum. Unless otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a majority of the total number of directors shall be necessary at all meetings to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and, except as may be otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors. 

If at least two (2) directors or one third (1/3) of the whole board of directors, whichever is greater, is present at any meeting at which a quorum is not present, a majority of the directors present at such meeting shall have power successively to adjourn the meeting from time to time to a subsequent date, without notice to any director other than announcement at the meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting which was adjourned. 

^Standing or Temporary Committees. The board of directors may, by resolution or resolutions passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one (1) or more committees, each committee to consist of one (1) or more directors of the corporation. The board may designate one (1) or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member of members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board of directors or in these bylaws, shall have and may exercise all of the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority of the board of directors with respect to amending the certificate of incorporation, adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation’s property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, amending the bylaws of the corporation, declaring a dividend or making any other distribution to the stockholders, authorizing the issuance of stock otherwise than pursuant to the grant or exercise of a stock option under employee stock option plans of the corporation, or appointing any member of any committee of the board of directors.

All committees so appointed shall, unless otherwise provided by the board of directors, keep regular minutes of the transactions at their meetings and shall cause them to be recorded in books kept for that purpose in the office of the 

^^^^^ 
corporation and shall report the same to the board of directors at its next meeting. The secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation may act as secretary of the committee if the committee so requests. 

^Compensation.

Members of special or standing committees may be allowed similar compensation for attending committee meetings. 

^Resignations. Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or shall take effect upon receipt thereof by the corporation if no time is specified therein; and unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

^^Indemnification in Actions by Third Parties. The corporation shall indemnify each person who has been or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or appellate (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was an officer or director of the corporation or is or was serving at the corporation’s request as a director or officer of any Other Enterprise against all liabilities and expenses, including, without limitation, judgments, amounts paid in settlement (provided that such settlement and all amounts paid in connection therewith are approved in advance by the corporation in accordance with paragraph (d) of this paragraph 28, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), attorneys’ fees, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, fines and other expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding (including without limitation the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of such action, suit or proceeding) if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful; provided, however, that the corporation shall not be required to indemnify or advance expenses to any such person or person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses in connection with an action, suit or proceeding initiated by such person unless the initiation of such action, suit or proceeding was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation. The termination of any such action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or under a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 

^^Indemnification in Derivative Actions. The corporation shall indemnify each person who has been or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was an officer of director of the corporation or is or was serving at the corporation’s request as a director or officer of any Other Enterprise against amounts paid in settlement thereof (provided that such settlement and all amounts paid in connection therewith are approved in advance by the corporation in accordance with subparagraph (d) of this paragraph 28, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and all expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action, suit or 

^^^^^ 
proceeding (including without limitation the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of such action, suit or proceeding) if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification under this subparagraph (b) shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action, suit or proceeding is brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability and in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to such indemnification. 

^^Indemnification for Expenses. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph 28, to the extent that a person who is or was serving as a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of any Other Enterprise, has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 28 (including the dismissal of any such action, suit or proceeding without prejudice), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. 

^^Determination of Right to Indemnification. Prior to indemnifying a person pursuant to the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 28, unless ordered by a court and except as otherwise provided by subparagraph (c) of this paragraph 28, the corporation shall determine that such person has met the specified standard of conduct entitling such person to indemnification as set forth under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 28. Any determination that a person shall or shall not be indemnified under the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 28 shall be made by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding, or if such quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or by the stockholders, and such determination shall be final and binding upon the corporation; provided, however, that in the event such determination is adverse to the person or persons to be indemnified hereunder, such person or persons shall have the right to maintain an action in any court of competent jurisdiction against the corporation to determine whether or not such person has met the requisite standard of conduct and is entitled to such indemnification hereunder. If such court action is successful and the person or persons is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, such person or persons shall be reimbursed by the corporation for all fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any such action (including without limitation the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of such action). 

^^Advancement of Expenses. Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by a person who may be entitled to indemnification hereunder in defending an action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or appellate, shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to indemnification by the corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by (i) the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding for which the advancement is requested, (ii) if a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders, that, based upon the facts known to the board, counsel or stockholders at the time such determination is made, such person acted in bad faith and in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was 

^^^^^ 
unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the board, stockholders or independent legal counsel reasonably determines that such person deliberately breached his duty to the corporation or its stockholders. 

^^Non-Exclusivity. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this paragraph 28 shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any statute, under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, policy of insurance or otherwise, both as to action in their official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding their respective offices, and shall not limit in any way any right which the corporation may have to make additional indemnifications with respect to the same or different persons or classes of persons. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this paragraph 28 shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and estate of such a person. 

^^Insurance. Upon resolution passed by the board of directors, the corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of any Other Enterprise, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this paragraph. 

^^Vesting of Rights. The rights granted by this paragraph 28 shall be vested in each person entitled to indemnification hereunder as a bargained-for, contractual condition of such person’s acceptance of his election or appointment as a director or officer of the corporation or serving at the request of the corporation as a director of officer of any Other Enterprise and while this paragraph 28 may be amended or repealed, no such amendment or repeal shall release, terminate or adversely affect the rights of such person under this paragraph 28 with respect to any act taken or the failure to take any act by such person prior to such amendment or repeal or with respect to any action, suit or proceeding with respect to such act or failure to act filed after such amendment or repeal. 

^^Definition of the “Corporation”. For purposes of this paragraph 28, references to “the corporation” shall, if and only if the board of directors shall determine, include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers or persons serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director or officer of any Other Enterprise, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director or officer of any Other Enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this paragraph 28 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. 

^^Certain Definitions. For the purpose of this paragraph 28, references to “Other Enterprises” or “Other Enterprise” shall include without limitation any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or employee benefit plan; references to “fines” shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; references to “defense” shall include investigations of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding as well as appeals thereof and shall also include any defensive assertion of a cross claim or counterclaim and references to “serving at the request of the corporation” shall include any service as a director or officer of a corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably 

^^^^^ 
believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the corporation” as referred to in this paragraph 28. For the purpose of this paragraph 28, unless the board of directors of the corporation shall determine otherwise, any director or officer of the corporation who shall serve as an officer or director of any Other Enterprise of which the corporation, directly or indirectly, is a stockholder or creditor, or in which the corporation is in any way interested, shall be presumed to be serving as such director or officer at the request of the corporation. In all other instances where any person shall serve as a director or officer of an Other Enterprise, if it is not otherwise established that such person is or was serving as such director or officer at the request of the corporation, the board of directors of the corporation shall determine whether such person is or was serving at the request of the corporation, and it shall not be necessary to show any actual or prior request for such service, which determination shall be final and binding on the corporation and the person seeking indemnification. 

^^Severability. If any provision of this paragraph 28 or the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, the remaining provisions of this paragraph 28 and the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and to the fullest extent possible the court finding such provision invalid, illegal or unenforceable shall modify and construe the provision so as to render it valid and enforceable as against all persons or entities and to give the maximum possible protection to persons subject to indemnification hereby within the bounds of validity, legality and enforceability. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any officer or director of the corporation or any person who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of any Other Enterprise, is entitled under any provision of this paragraph 28, to indemnification by the corporation for some or a portion of the judgments, amounts paid in settlement, attorneys’ fees, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, fines or other expenses actually and reasonably incurred by any such person in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (including without limitation, the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of such action, suit or proceeding), whether civil, criminal, or administrative, investigative or appellate, but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify such person for the portion thereof to which such person is entitled. 

^Action without a Meeting. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors or any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if written consent thereto is signed by all members of the board of directors or of such committee, as the case may be, and such written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee. 

\centered Officers 

^(a) Officers  Who Shall Constitute. The officers of the corporation shall be a chairman of the board, a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, a treasurer, one or more assistant secretaries and one or more assistant treasurers. The board shall elect a president and a secretary at its first meeting after each annual meeting of the stockholders. The board then, or from time to time, may also elect one or more of the other prescribed officers as it may deem advisable, but need not elect any officers other than a president and a secretary. The board may, if it desires, elect or appoint additional officers and may further identify or describe any one or more of the officers of the corporation. 

Officers of the corporation need not be members of the board of directors. Any two (2) or more offices may be held by the same person. 

^^^^^ 
An officer shall be deemed qualified when he enters upon the duties of the office to which he has been elected or appointed and furnishes any bond required by the board; but the board may also require his written acceptance and promise faithfully to discharge the duties of such office. 

^^Term of Office. Each officer of the corporation shall hold his office at the pleasure of the board of directors or for such other period as the board may specify at the time of his election or appointment, or until his death, resignation or removal by the board, whichever first occurs. In any event, each officer of the corporation who is not reelected or reappointed at the annual election of officers by the board next succeeding his election or appointment shall be deemed to have been removed by the board, unless the board provides otherwise at the time of his election or appointment. 

^^Other Agents. The board from time to time may also appoint such other agents for the corporation as it shall deem necessary or advisable, each of whom shall serve at the pleasure of the board or for such period as the board may specify, and shall exercise such powers, have such titles and perform such duties as shall be determined from time to time by the board or by an officer empowered by the board to make such determinations. 

^The Chairman of the Board. If a chairman of the board be elected, he shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and directors at which he may be present and shall have such other duties, powers and authority as may be prescribed elsewhere in these bylaws. The board of directors may delegate such other authority and assign such additional duties to the chairman of the board, other than those conferred by law exclusively upon the president, as it may from time to time determine, and, to the extent permissible by law, the board may designate the chairman of the board as the chief executive officer of the corporation with all of the powers otherwise conferred upon the president of the corporation under paragraph 32 of these bylaws, or it may, from time to time, divide the responsibilities, duties and authority for the general control and management of the corporation’s business and affairs between the chairman of the board and the president. 

^The President. Unless the board otherwise provides, the president shall be the chief executive officer of the corporation with such general executive powers and duties of supervision and management as are usually vested in the office of the chief executive officer of a corporation, and he shall carry into effect all directions and resolutions of the board.

The president may execute all bonds, notes, debentures, mortgages and other instruments for and in the name of the corporation, may cause the corporate seal to be affixed thereto, and may execute all other instruments for and in the name of the corporation. 

Unless the board otherwise provides, the president, or any person designated in writing by him, shall have full power and authority on behalf of this corporation (i) to attend and to vote or take action at any meeting of the holders of securities of corporations in which this corporation may hold securities, and at such meetings shall possess and may exercise any and all rights and powers incident to being a holder of such securities, and (ii) to execute and deliver waivers of notice and proxies for and in the name of the corporation with respect to any securities held by the corporation. 

He shall, unless the board otherwise provides, be ex officio a member of all standing committees. 

He shall have such other or further duties and authority as may be prescribed elsewhere in these bylaws or from time to time by the board of directors. 

^^^^^ 
If a chairman of the board be elected or appointed and designated as chief executive officer of the corporation, as provided in paragraph 31, of these bylaws, the president shall perform such duties as may be specifically delegated to him by the board of directors or are conferred by law exclusively upon him, and in the absence, disability, or inability or refusal to act of the chairman of the board, the president shall perform the duties and exercise the powers of the chairman of the board. 

^Vice Presidents. In the absence of the president or in the event of his disability, or inability or refusal to act, any vice president may perform the duties and exercise the powers of the president until the board otherwise provides.

He shall perform similar duties for the executive committee and other standing committees when requested by the board or any such committee. 

The secretary shall see that all books, records, lists and information, or duplicates, required to be maintained in Delaware, or elsewhere, are so maintained. 

The secretary shall keep in safe custody the seal of the corporation, and shall have authority to affix the seal to any instrument requiring a corporate seal and, when so affixed, he shall attest the seal by his signature. The board of directors may give general authority to any other officer to affix the seal of the corporation and to attest the affixing by his signature. 

The secretary shall have the general duties, responsibilities and authorities of a secretary of a corporation and shall perform such other duties and have such other responsibility and authority as may be prescribed elsewhere in these bylaws or from time to time by the board of directors or the chief executive officer of the corporation, under whose direct supervision he shall be. 

In the absence of the secretary or in the event of his disability, or inability or refusal to act, any assistant secretary may perform the duties and exercise the powers of the secretary until the board otherwise provides. Assistant secretaries shall perform such other duties as the board of directors may from time to time prescribe. 

^The Treasurer and Assistant Treasurers. The treasurer shall have responsibility for the safekeeping of the funds and securities of the corporation, shall keep or cause to be kept full and accurate accounts of receipts and disbursements in books belonging to the corporation and shall keep, or cause to be kept, all other books of account and accounting records of the corporation. He shall deposit or cause to be deposited all moneys and other valuable effects in the name and to the credit of the corporation in such depositories as may be designated by the board of directors or by any officer of the corporation to whom such authority has been granted by the board. 

He shall disburse, or permit to be disbursed, the funds of the corporation as may be ordered, or authorized generally, by the board, and shall render to the chief executive officer of the corporation and the directors whenever they may require it, an account of all his transactions as treasurer and of those under his jurisdiction, and of the financial condition of the corporation. 

He shall perform such other duties and shall have such other responsibility and authority as may be prescribed elsewhere in these bylaws or from time to time by the board of directors. 

^^^^^ 
He shall have the general duties, powers and responsibility of a treasurer of a corporation and shall, unless otherwise provided by the board, be the chief financial and accounting officer of the corporation. 

If required by the board, he shall give the corporation a bond in a sum and with one or more sureties satisfactory to the board, for the faithful performance of the duties of his office and for the restoration to the corporation, in the case of his death, resignation, retirement or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind in his possession or under his control which belong to the corporation. 

In the absence of the treasurer or in the event of his disability, or inability or refusal to act, any assistant treasurer may perform the duties and exercise the powers of the treasurer. Assistant treasurers shall perform such other duties and have such other authority as the board of directors may from time to time prescribe. 

^Duties of Officers May be Delegated. If any officer of the corporation be absent or unable to act, or for any other reason that the board may deem sufficient, the board may delegate, from the time being, some or all of the functions, duties, powers and responsibilities of any officer to any other officer, or to any other agent or employee of the corporation or other responsible person, provided a majority of the whole board concurs. 

^Removal. Any officer or agent elected or appointed by the board of directors, and any employee, may be removed or discharged by the board whenever in its judgment the best interests of the corporation would be served thereby, but such removal or discharge shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed or discharged. 

^Salaries and Compensation. Salaries and compensation of all elected officers of the corporation shall be fixed, increased or decreased by the board of directors, but this power, except as to the salary or compensation of the chairman of the board and the president, may, unless prohibited by law, be delegated by the board to the chairman of the board or the president, or may be delegated to a committee. Salaries and compensation of all appointed officers, agents and employees of the corporation may be fixed, increased or decreased by the board of directors, but until action is taken with respect thereto by the board of directors, the same may be fixed, increased or decreased by the president or such other officer or officers as may be empowered by the board of directors to do so. 

^Delegation of Authority to Hire, Discharge and Designate Duties. The board from time to time may delegate to the chairman of the board, the president or other officer or executive employee of the corporation, authority to hire, discharge and fix and modify the duties, salary or other compensation of employees of the corporation under their jurisdiction, and the board may delegate to such officer or executive employee similar authority with respect to obtaining and retaining for the corporation the services of attorneys, accountants and other experts. 

\centered Stock 

^Shares of Stock. The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificated or uncertificated stock. The shares of stock shall be issued in numerical order. Stockholders shall not be entitled to receive a certificate to evidence share ownership. The board of directors, chairman of the board, president or secretary shall, at their discretion, determine whether shares shall be issued in certificated or uncertificated form. To the extent that shares are represented by certificates, such certificates of stock shall be signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman of the board or the president or a vice president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer or the secretary or an 

^^^^^ 
assistant secretary, certifying the number of shares represented by such certificate. Any of or all the signatures on such certificate may be a facsimile, engraved or printed. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile, engraved or printed signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, such certificate may nevertheless be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if such officer, transfer agent or registrar who signed such certificate, or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon, had not ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar of the corporation. 

^Transfers of Stock. Transfers of stock shall be made only upon the stock transfer books of the corporation, kept at the office of the corporation or of the transfer agent designated to transfer the class of stock, and before a new certificate, provided such shares are represented by a certificate, is issued or a transfer of stock is effectuated, the old certificate (if such shares were initially issued in certificated form) shall be surrendered for cancellation. Until and unless the board appoints some other person, firm or corporation as its transfer agent (and upon the revocation of any such appointment, thereafter until a new appointment is similarly made) the secretary of the corporation shall be the transfer agent of the corporation without the necessity of any formal action of the board, and the secretary, or any person designated by him, shall perform all of the duties thereof. 

^Registered Stockholders. Only registered stockholders shall be entitled to be treated by the corporation as the holders and owners in fact of the shares standing in their respective names, and the corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as expressly provided by applicable federal law or by the laws of Delaware. 

^Lost Certificates. The board of directors, chairman of the board, president or secretary may direct that certificated stock be cancelled and the stock reissued as either certificated or uncertificated stock, in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate or certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issuance of a replacement certificate or certificates or the recording of uncertificated stock, the board of directors, chairman of the board, president or secretary may, in their discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to give the corporation and its transfer agents and registrars, if any, a bond in such sum as it may direct to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the certificate or certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed or with respect to the issuance of such new certificate, certificates or uncertificated stock. 

^Regulations. The board of directors shall have power and authority to make all such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer, conversion and registration of certificated or uncertificated shares of stock of the corporation, not inconsistent with the laws of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation of the corporation and these bylaws. 

^Fixing Record Date. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, if such action is authorized, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board 

^^^^^ 
of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 

\centered Dividends and Finance 

^Dividends. Dividends upon the outstanding shares of stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation and of any applicable law and of these bylaws, may be declared by the board of directors at any meeting. Subject to such provisions, dividends may be paid in cash, in property or in shares of stock of the corporation. 

^Creation of Reserves. The directors may set apart out of any of the funds of the corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose or may abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created. 

^Depositories. The moneys of the corporation shall be deposited in the name of the corporation in such bank or banks or other depositories as the board of directors shall designate, and shall be drawn out only by check signed by persons designated by resolution adopted by the board of directors, except that the board of directors may delegate said powers in the manner hereinafter provided in this paragraph 48. The board of directors may by resolution authorize an officer or officers of the corporation to designate any bank or banks or other depositories in which moneys of the corporation may be deposited, and to designate the persons who may sign checks drawn on any particular account or accounts of the corporation, whether created by direct designation of the board of directors or by an authorized officer or officers as aforesaid. 

^Fiscal Year. The board of directors shall have power to fix and from time to time change the fiscal year of the corporation. In the absence of action by the board of directors, the fiscal year of the corporation shall end each year on the date which the corporation treated as the close of its first fiscal year, until such time, if any, as the fiscal year shall be changed by the board of directors. 

^Directors, Annual Statement. The board of directors may present at each annual meeting of the stockholders, and when called for by vote of the stockholders shall present to any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, a full and clear statement of the business and condition of the corporation. 

\centered Books and Records 

^Books, Accounts and Records. The books, accounts and records of the corporation, except as may be otherwise required by the laws of the State of Delaware, may be kept outside of the State of Delaware, at such place or places as the board of directors may from time to time determine. The board of directors shall determine whether, to what extent and the conditions upon which the books, accounts and records of the corporation, or any of them, shall be open to the inspection of the stockholders, and no stockholder shall have any right to inspect any book, account or record of the corporation, except as conferred by law or by resolution of the stockholders or directors. 

\centered Miscellaneous 

^Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the statutes of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or of these bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not 

^^^^^ 
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 

^Contracts. The board of directors may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation, and such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. 

^Amendments. These bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, or new bylaws may be adopted, in the manner provided in the certificate of incorporation. 

^Business Combinations. The corporation shall not be governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
