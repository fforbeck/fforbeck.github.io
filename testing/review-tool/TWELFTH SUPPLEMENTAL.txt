^Procedures for Exercise. 

^^To exercise the Repurchase Right, a Holder must deliver, on or before the second Business Day immediately preceding the Repurchase Date, the Notes to be repurchased to the Paying Agent (or the Units to the Purchase Contract Agent, if (x) the Early Mandatory Settlement Date occurs on or after the Repurchase Date and (y) the Notes have not been separated from the Units), together with a duly completed written Repurchase Notice, in each case in accordance with appropriate DTC procedures, unless the Notes are not in the form of a Global Note, in which case such Holder must deliver the Notes to be repurchased to the Paying Agent or the Units that include the Notes to be repurchased to the Purchase Contract Agent (if (x) the Early Mandatory Settlement Date occurs on or after the Repurchase Date and (y) the Notes have not been separated from the Units), duly endorsed for transfer to the Company, together with a Repurchase Notice, to the Paying Agent.

^^If the Paying Agent holds money on the Repurchase Date sufficient to pay the Repurchase Price with respect to those Notes, for which the Repurchase Right has been exercised, then (i) such Notes shall cease to be outstanding and interest shall cease to accrue threreon (whether or not book-entry transfer of the Notes or Units, as applicable, is made or whether or not the Notes or Units, as applicable, are delivered as required herein); and (ii) all other rights of the Holder shall terminate (other than the right to receive the Repurchase Price). 

^^The Company shall, in connection with any repurchase offer pursuant to this Article IV, if required, (i) comply with the provisions of the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act that may then be applicable; and (ii) file a Schedule TO or any other required schedule under the Exchange Act. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Notes may be repurchased at the option of Holders if the principal amount thereof has been accelerated, and such acceleration has not been rescinded, on or prior to the Repurchase Date (except in the case of a Default by the Company of the payment of the Repurchase Price with respect to such Notes).

Indebtedness); provided that if such failure to pay shall be remedied, waived or extended, then the Event of Default hereunder shall be deemed likewise to be remedied, waived or extended without further action by the Company; 

^^a final judgment or judgments that exceed $25.0 million or more in the aggregate, for the payment of money, having been entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and such judgment or judgments is not satisfied, stayed, annulled or rescinded within 60 days of being entered;

^consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, 

^consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property, or 

^makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or 

^^a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: 

^is for relief against the Company or any Material Subsidiary as debtor in an involuntary case, 

^appoints a Custodian of the Company or any Material Subsidiary or a Custodian for all or substantially all of the property of the Company or any Material Subsidiary, or 

^orders the liquidation of the Company or any Material Subsidiary and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days.

The notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a “Notice of Default.” If such a Default is cured within such time period, it ceases. 

^Acceleration Event. (a) The Holders may not enforce the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. 

^^If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least [[Percentage 3]]% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare all Notes to be due and payable immediately (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.02(g) and (h), in which case the Notes will be deemed automatically accelerated without the need for any declaration or notice) (such acceleration, the “**Acceleration Event**”). 

^^The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by written notice to the Trustee and the Company may waive any Default or Event of Default (other than any Default or Event of Default arising under Section 6.02(a)) on the Notes. Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may rescind an Acceleration Event and its consequence (except due to an Event of Default arising under Section 6.02(a)) by written notice to the Trustee and Company if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree issued in respect of such Acceleration Event and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived.

If an installment is payable for any period shorter than a full Installment Payment Period, such installment shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month. In the event that any date on which an installment is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the installment on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay. However, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, then such installment payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date when such installment payment was originally due. Installments shall be paid to the person in whose name the Note is registered, with limited exceptions, at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the related Installment Payment Date (each, a “**Regular Record Date**”). If the Notes do not remain in book-entry only form, the Company shall have the right to select Regular Record Dates, noticed in writing in advance, to the Trustee and Holders, which will be more than 14 days but less than 60 days prior to the relevant Installment Payment Date. Any such installment payment not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holders at the close of business on such Regular Record Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more successor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date to be fixed by

\centered [[Company]] 

This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company designated as its [[Percentage 1]]% Senior Amortized Notes due 2013 (herein sometimes referred to as the “**Notes**”), issued under the Indenture, dated as of [[Date 2]], between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “**Trustee**,” which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture) (the “**Base Indenture**,” and the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture, dated [[Date 1]], between the Company and the Trustee, the “**Indenture**”), to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders. The terms of other series of Securities issued under the Indenture may vary with respect to interest rates, issue dates, maturity, redemption, repayment, currency of payment and otherwise as provided in the Indenture. The Indenture further provides that securities of a single series may be issued at various times, with different maturity dates and may bear interest at different rates. This series of Securities is limited in aggregate principal amount as specified in the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture. 

Each installment shall constitute a payment of interest (at a rate of [[Percentage 1]]% per annum) and a partial repayment of principal on the Note, allocated as set forth in the schedule below: 

**Installment Payment Date**      **Amount of Principal**      **Amount of Interest**
[[Date 7]]      $   0.381      $   0.097

[[Date 16]]      $   0.401      $   0.052
[[Date 17]]      $   0.408      $   0.045
[[Date 18]]      $   0.415      $   0.038
[[Date 19]]      $   0.423      $   0.030
[[Date 20]]      $   0.430      $   0.023

[[Date 8]]      $   0.445      $   0.008

The Securities of this series shall not be subject to redemption at the option of the Company. However, a Holder shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase some or all of its Notes for cash at the Repurchase Price per Note to be repurchased on the Repurchase Date, upon the occurrence of certain events and subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture. 

This Security is not entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance and covenant defeasance at any time of the indebtedness on this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security. 

If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then (unless no declaration of acceleration or notice is required for such Event of Default) either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than [[Percentage 3]]% in principal amount of the Notes of this series then outstanding may declare the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series, and all 

\centered A-R-1 

interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately, in the manner, subject to the conditions and with the effect provided in the Indenture. 

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, to execute supplemental indentures for certain purposes as described therein. 

*Obligations Unconditional.* No provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay installments on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed. 

*Additional Terms*. The Notes are originally being issued as part of the Company’s [[Percentage 4: Number]]% Tangible Equity Units (the “**Units**”) issued pursuant to that certain Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of [[Date 1]], between the Company, Trustee and U.S. Bank National Association, as Purchase Contract Agent (the “**Purchase Contract Agreement**”). Holders of the Units have the right to separate such Units into their constituent parts, consisting of Purchase Contracts (as defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement) and Notes, during the times, and under the circumstances, described in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Following separation of any Unit into its constituent parts, the Notes are transferable independently from the Purchase Contracts. In addition, separated Notes can be recombined with separated Purchase Contracts to recreate Units, as provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Reference is hereby made to the Purchase Contract Agreement for a more complete description of the terms thereof applicable to the Units and Notes. 

*Transfer and Exchange*. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note shall be registered on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of [[Address 15: Address]] by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, shall be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. 

The Securities of this series are initially issued in registered, global form without coupons in initial minimum denominations of one Note and integral multiples in excess thereof. 

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. 

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Holder in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 

**This Note and the Indenture, and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or related to the Indenture or this Note, shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of [[Address 16: Address]] effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.** 

All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. 

No recourse shall be had for the payment of any installment on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company in the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or of any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment of penalty or otherwise; and all such personal liability is expressly released and waived as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the issuance of this Note. 

The Company and each Holder agrees, for United States tax purposes, to treat the Notes as indebtedness.
