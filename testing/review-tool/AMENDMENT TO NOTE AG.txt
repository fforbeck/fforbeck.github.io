^^^The definition of “Responsible Officer” is hereby amended by deleting such definition in its entirety and by substituting the following therefor: 

“Responsible Officer” means, in the case of any Person, the chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, treasurer, controller or chief investment officer of such Person, or, in the case of a limited partnership, the general partner of such Person. Any document delivered hereunder that is signed by a Responsible Officer of a Person shall be conclusively presumed to have been authorized by all necessary corporate, partnership and/or other action on the part of such Person and such Responsible Officer shall be conclusively presumed to have acted on behalf of such Person. 

^^^Section 1.1 of the Note Agreement is hereby further amended by inserting the following new definition of “Unapplied Cash” therein in appropriate alphabetical order: 

“Unapplied Cash” means (i) Cash received by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for the sole purpose of holding such funds in escrow for the benefit of an identifiable third party until a separate escrow deposit account is established and maintained, which account shall be promptly established, provided that the escrowed funds described in this clause (i) shall at no time exceed $[[USD Value 1: Number]] in the aggregate for any single borrower, (ii) Cash in the nature of an overpayment of an Obligor Loan received by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor in its capacity as a lender or as the administrative or collateral agent for a syndicate of lenders for so long as such amounts constitute an overpayment, and/or (iii) Cash in the form of unidentified wires until such wires can be properly identified for transfer to the appropriate deposit account.

^^*Amendment to Section 6.11 of the Note Agreement*. Section 6.11 of the Note Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following sentence at the end thereof:

As used herein, the term “Alameda Joinder Documents” shall mean collectively, (i) that certain Annex to Guaranty in the form attached to the Subsidiary Guaranty, (ii) that certain Supplement No. 1 to Pledge and Security Agreement in the form attached to the Security Agreement, and (iii) a Secretary’s Certificate, attaching organizational documents, incumbency information, good standing certificates and resolutions, all in form and substance similar to those delivered by the other Subsidiary Guarantors to the Administrative Agent on the Closing Date. The parties hereto acknowledge that an opinion with respect to Alameda and the Alameda Joinder Documents is not being requested or required by the Administrative Agent as of the date hereof (and shall not be a condition to the waiver of the Alameda Joinder Requirement), but that the Administrative Agent has reserved its right to hereafter request such an opinion with respect to the addition of any subsidiary guarantor and the Company hereby acknowledges such right. The parties acknowledge and agree that the waivers contained herein are limited solely to the Alameda Joinder Requirement and the Control Agreement Requirement. Except as expressly set forth herein, the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Administrative Agent or any Holder under the Note Agreement or any other Note Document executed in connection therewith, nor constitute a waiver of any other provision contained therein. 

^No Default; Representations and Warranties, Etc. The Company hereby represents, warrants, confirms and covenants that: (a) the representations and warranties of the Note Parties contained in Article V of the Note Agreement are true and correct on and as of the date hereof as if made on such date (except to the extent that such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case, such representations were true and correct as of such date); (b) after giving effect to this Amendment, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and (c) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Amendment and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (i) have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Company, (ii) have not violated, conflicted with or resulted in a default under and will not violate or conflict with or result in a default under any applicable law or regulation, any term or provision of the organizational documents of the Company or any term or provision of any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding on the Company or any of its assets, and (iii) do not require any consent, waiver or approval of or by any Person which has not been obtained. 

^Ratification and Confirmation. The Company hereby agrees and confirms that: 

^^the Note Agreement and each of the other Note Documents, as amended and otherwise modified by the amendments specifically provided herein, are and shall continue to be in full force and effect and are hereby in all respects ratified and confirmed; and 

^^the liens and security interests granted in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of itself and the Holders under the terms of the Note Documents are perfected, effective, enforceable and valid and that such liens and security interests are, in each case, a first priority lien and security interest except to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by the Note Documents and that such liens and security interests are hereby in all respects ratified and confirmed.

^^Counterparts of Amendment. The Administrative Agent shall have received from each party hereto either (a) a counterpart of this Amendment signed on behalf of such party or (b) written evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (which may include telecopy transmission of a signed signature page of this Amendment) that such party has signed a counterpart of this Amendment.

^^Other Documents. The Administrative Agent shall have received such other documents as the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably requested, all of which shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

^^Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute an amendment, modification or waiver of any of the provisions of the Note Agreement or the other Note Documents, all of which remain in full force and effect as of the date hereof and are hereby ratified and confirmed. The Company acknowledges and agrees that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to entitle such party to a consent to, or a waiver, amendment or modification of, any of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Note Documents in similar or different circumstances or shall prejudice any right or rights which any Holder now has or may have under, or in connection with, the Note Agreement, as amended hereby, the Note Documents, or any other documents referred to herein or therein. 

^^This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be an original, but all counterparts shall together constitute one instrument. Whenever the terms or sections amended hereby shall be referred to in the Note Agreement, Note Documents or such other documents (whether directly or by incorporation into other defined terms), such defined terms shall be deemed to refer to those terms or sections as amended by this Amendment. 

^^This Amendment shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state, provided that the Administrative Agent and each Holder shall retain all rights arising under Federal law. This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
