Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Landry’s Restaurants, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and each of the Guarantors (as hereinafter defined) hereby agree with you as follows: 

^**Issuance of Notes**. Subject to the terms and conditions herein contained, the Company proposes to issue and sell to Jefferies & Company, Inc. (the “Initial Purchaser”) $[[USD Value 1]] aggregate principal amount of its 11/% Senior Secured Notes due 2015 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued pursuant to the indenture (the “Indenture”), dated as of [[Date 2: Date]], by and among the Company, the Guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Collateral Agent”), and Wilmington Trust FSB, as successor trustee. (in such capacity, the “Trustee”). Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, shall have the meanings set forth in the “*Description of Exchange Notes*” section of our registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-164887) (the “Exchange Offer Registration Statement”). 

The Notes will be offered and sold to the Initial Purchaser pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Upon original issuance thereof, and until such time as the same is no longer required under the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Notes shall bear the legends set forth in the *“Notice to Investors”* section of the preliminary offering term sheet, dated the date hereof (the “Preliminary Offering Term Sheet”), including the information incorporated by reference therein and the final offering term sheet (the “Final Offering Term Sheet”) which includes the pricing terms relating to the purchase and sale of the Notes by the Initial Purchaser (the “Offering”). The Preliminary Offering Term Sheet and the Final Offering Term Sheet as amended and supplemented are referred to herein as the “Pricing Disclosure Package.” 

Approximately $24.0 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be used to finance the acquisition of the stock of The Oceanaire, Inc., an upscale seafood restaurant chain, if such acquisition is consummated. The remaining amount of net proceeds from the sale of the notes, or all of the net proceeds from this Offering if the acquisition is not consummated, will be used to repay outstanding revolver balances and for general corporate purposes. 

^**Terms of Offering**. The Initial Purchaser has advised the Company, and the Company understands, that the Initial Purchaser will make an offer to sell (the “Exempt Resales”) some or all of the Notes purchased by the Initial Purchaser hereunder on the terms set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented, solely to persons (the “Subsequent Purchasers”) whom the Initial Purchaser reasonably believes to be (a) “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the 

Securities Act (“QIBs”), as such rule may be amended from time to time, and (b) non-U.S. persons permitted to purchase the Notes in offshore transactions in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S Persons”), as such rule may be amended from time to time. 

Pursuant to the Indenture, each Domestic Restricted Subsidiary of the Company shall fully and unconditionally guarantee to each holder of the Notes and the Trustee, on a senior secured basis, the payment and performance of the Company’s Obligations under the Indenture and the Notes (each such subsidiary being referred to herein as a “Guarantor” and each such guarantee being referred to herein as a “Guarantee”). 

Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and the Collateral Agreements, all of the Company’s and each Guarantor’s obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by a Lien on substantially all the assets of the Company and the Guarantors; *provided, however*, that pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, such Lien will be contractually subordinated to a Lien on the Collateral that secures all Obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated [[Date 2]], by and among the Company, the Guarantors, Wells Fargo Capital Finance (formerly known as Wells Fargo Foothill), as administrative agent, co-lead arranger and co-syndication agent, Jefferies Finance LLC, as co-lead arranger (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) and certain other permitted indebtedness.

Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors will agree, among other things, to file with the SEC (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to the 11/% Senior Secured Notes due 2015 (the “Exchange Notes”), which shall be identical to the Notes (except that the Exchange Notes shall have been registered pursuant to such registration statement and will not be subject to restrictions on transfer or contain additional interest provisions) to be offered in exchange for the Notes (such offer to exchange being referred to as the “Exchange Offer”), and/or (ii) under certain circumstances, a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) relating to the resale by certain holders of the Notes. If required under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will issue Exchange Notes and cause the Guarantors to issue exchange guarantees to the Initial Purchaser (the “Private Exchange Notes” and “Private Exchange Guarantees,” respectively). If the Company fails to satisfy its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, it will be required to pay additional interest to the holders of the Notes under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement. 

This Agreement, the Indenture, the Collateral Agreements, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Notes, the Exchange Notes, the Private Exchange Notes, the Guarantees and the Private Exchange Guarantees are collectively referred to herein as the “Transaction Documents.” The Offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the issuance and sale of the Notes in accordance with this Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the “Transactions”. 

^**Purchase, Sale and Delivery**. On the basis of the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained herein and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to the Initial Purchaser, and the Initial Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company the principal amount of the Notes at a purchase price of [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the aggregate principal amount thereof.

The Company and the Guarantors shall not be liable under this Section 8 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without their prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

^^The Initial Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Company and the Guarantors and their respective directors, officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any Losses which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) have resulted solely from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or from the omission or alleged omission to state, in the Pricing Disclosure Package, or any amendment or supplement thereto, a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent (but only to the extent) that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Initial Purchaser Information; and, subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, will reimburse, as incurred, any legal or other expenses incurred by the Company, each of the Guarantors or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with any such Loss or action in respect thereof. 

^^If any proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any person entitled to indemnification hereunder (an “Indemnified Party”), such Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice to the party or parties from which such indemnification is sought (the “Indemnifying Parties” and each, an “Indemnifying Party”); provided, that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Parties shall not relieve any of the Indemnifying Parties from any obligation or liability except to the extent (but only to the extent) that such Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced materially by such failure. In case any such action is brought against any Indemnified Party, and it notifies the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may determine, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party; *provided, however*, that if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party to represent the Indemnified Party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel in writing that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it and/or other Indemnified Parties that are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified Party within a reasonable time after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of notice of the institution of such action, then, in each such case, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party or Parties and such Indemnified Party or Parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party or Parties at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and approval by such Indemnified Party of counsel appointed to defend such action, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to such Indemnified Party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, unless (i) the Indemnified Party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that in connection with such action the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel in any applicable jurisdiction) in any one action or separate but substantially similar actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, designated by the Initial Purchaser in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 8 or the Company in the case of paragraph (b) of this Section 8, representing the Indemnified Party under such paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action or actions) or (ii) the Indemnifying Party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the Indemnified Party at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. After such notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for the costs and expenses of any settlement of such action effected by such Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless such Indemnified Party waived in writing its rights under this Section 8, in which case the Indemnified Party may effect such a settlement without such consent; provided, that, in any case, any settlement shall be subject to paragraph (d) of this Section 8. None of the Indemnifying Parties shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of any judgment in or enter into any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not any Indemnified Party is a party thereto) unless such judgment or settlement includes, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all Losses that may arise from such Proceeding or the subject matter thereof (whether or not any Indemnified Party is a party thereto). 

^^If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold such Indemnified Party harmless for any Losses in respect of which this Section 8 would otherwise apply by its terms (other than by reason of exceptions provided in this Section 8), then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchaser, on the other hand, from the Offering or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchaser, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchaser, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the Offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, to the total discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchaser, on the other hand. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchaser, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Initial Purchaser, on the other hand, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any Proceeding, to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 was available to such party. 

Each party hereto agrees that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, none of the Initial Purchaser shall not be obligated to make contributions hereunder that in the aggregate exceed the total discounts, commissions and other compensation received by such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of the untrue or alleged untrue statements or the omissions or alleged omissions to state a material fact. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchaser’ obligation to contribute hereunder shall be several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint. For purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph, each person, if any, who controls the Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Initial Purchaser, and each director of the Company and the Guarantors, each officer of the Company and the Guarantors and each person, if any, who controls either of the Company or the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors. 

^^The indemnification and contribution obligations contained in this Section 8 are in addition to any liability that any of the Indemnifying Parties may otherwise have to the Indemnified Parties, and do not limit in any way rights or remedies which may otherwise be available at law or in equity. 

^**Termination**. The Initial Purchaser may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing Date by written notice to the Company if any of the following has occurred: 

^^since the date hereof, any Material Adverse Effect or development involving or expected to result in a prospective Material Adverse Effect that could, in any of the Initial Purchaser’s sole judgment, be expected to (i) make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package, or (ii) materially impair the investment quality of any of the Notes; 

^^the failure of the Company or the Guarantors to satisfy the conditions contained in Section 7(a) hereof on or prior to the Closing Date; 

^^any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or declaration of war by the United States or other national or international calamity or crisis, including acts of terrorism, or material adverse change or disruption in economic conditions in, or in the financial markets of, the United States (it being understood that any such change or disruption shall be relative to such conditions and markets as in effect on the date hereof), if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, calamity, crisis, act or material adverse change in the economic conditions in, or in the financial markets of, the United States could be reasonably expected to make it, in any of the Initial Purchaser’s sole judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to market or proceed with the offering or delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package or to enforce contracts for the sale of any of the Notes; 

^^trading in the Company’s common stock shall have been suspended by the SEC or The New York Stock Exchange or the suspension or limitation of trading generally in securities on the New York Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Global Market shall have occurred or any setting of limitations on prices for securities on any such exchange shall have occurred; 

^^the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation after the date hereof of any Applicable Law that in the Initial Purchaser’s counsel’s reasonable opinion materially and adversely affects, or could be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect, the properties, business, prospects, operations, earnings, assets, liabilities or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; 

^^any securities of the Company shall have been downgraded or placed on any “watch list” for possible downgrading by any “nationally recognized statistical rating organization,” as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act; or 

^^the representation and warranty contained in the first sentence of Section 4(a) of this Agreement is incorrect in any way; or 

^^the declaration of a banking moratorium by any Governmental Authority; or the taking of any action by any Governmental Authority after the date hereof in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs that in any of the Initial Purchaser’s opinion could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial markets in the United States or elsewhere. 

^**Survival of Representations and Indemnities**. The respective representations and warranties, covenants, indemnities and contribution and expense reimbursement provisions and other agreements, representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantors set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, and will survive, regardless of (i) any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchaser (ii) acceptance of the Notes, and payment for them hereunder, and (iii) any termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the Company shall remain liable for all expenses pursuant to Sections 5(f) and . 

^**Information Supplied by the Initial Purchaser**. The name of the Initial Purchaser set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package, the statements set forth on the cover page with respect to price and the statements set forth in (a) the first sentence of the fifth paragraph, and (b) the first sentence of the seventh paragraph under the heading “*Plan of Distribution*” in the Pricing Disclosure Package (to the extent such statements relate to the Initial Purchaser) (the “Initial Purchaser Information) constitute the only information furnished by the Initial Purchaser to the Company or the Guarantors for the purposes of Sections 4(a) and hereof. 

^**No Fiduciary Relationship**. The Company and the Guarantors hereby acknowledge that the Initial Purchaser is acting solely as initial purchaser in connection with the purchase and sale of the Notes. The Company further acknowledges that the Initial Purchaser is acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arm’s length basis, and in no event do the parties intend that the Initial Purchaser act or be responsible as a fiduciary to the Company, the Guarantors or their respective management, stockholders or creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that the Initial Purchaser may undertake or have undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Notes, either before or after the date hereof. The Initial Purchaser hereby expressly disclaims any fiduciary or similar obligations, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions, and the Company and the Guarantors hereby confirm their understanding and agreement to that effect. The parties hereto agree that they are each responsible for making their own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions and that any opinions or views expressed by the Initial Purchaser to the Company or the Guarantors regarding such transactions, including, but not limited to, any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Notes, do not constitute advice or recommendations to the Company or the Guarantors. The Company and the Guarantors hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that either of the Company may have against the Initial Purchaser with respect to any breach or alleged breach of any fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or the Guarantors in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions.

\centered FORM OF OPINIONS OF COMPANY COUNSEL 

Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications set forth herein, we are of the opinion that: 

^The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in the State of Texas. Each Guarantor is a corporation or limited partnership validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. 

^The Company and each Guarantor organized under the laws of the State of Delaware or Texas (the “Covered Guarantors”) (a) has the corporate or limited partnership power and authority, as applicable, to execute, deliver and perform each Transaction Document to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, (b) has taken all corporate or limited partnership action, as applicable, necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of each Transaction Document to which it is a party and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, (c) has duly executed and delivered each Transaction Document to which it is a party and (d) owns, leases and operates its properties and assets and conducts its business as described in the Offering Memorandum. 

^The execution and delivery by the Company and the Guarantors of each Transaction Document to which it is a party does not, and the performance by each of the Company and the Guarantors of its obligations thereunder, including the issuance and sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchaser, and the Transactions contemplated thereby, will not, (a) violate the certificate or articles of incorporation, certificate or articles of formation, bylaws or limited partnership agreement, as applicable, of the Company and the Covered Guarantors, (b) violate any Applicable Law, (c) to our knowledge, violate any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award binding upon or affecting the Company and the Guarantors, (d) result in the breach of, or constitute a default or require any payment to be made under, any agreement, document or instrument, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, agreement or instrument (i) identified as an exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended [[Date 4]] and (ii) listed on Schedule 1 attached hereto or (e) except for the Liens created under the Original Transaction Documents and Permitted Liens, result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any property of the Company and the Guarantors. 

^No Governmental Authorization (as defined below) and no notice to or filing with, any United States federal or New York or Texas governmental or Delaware corporate authority or regulatory body, is required for (a) the issuance and sale by the Company of the Notes to the 

Schedule will include all agreements on Schedule 4.17 of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to the extent not filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended [[Date 4]].

“Original Transaction Documents” should be defined to include all transaction documents from the [[Date 2]] transaction that included a grant of a security interest or lien in any real or personal property.

Initial Purchaser, the execution, delivery or performance by the Company or the Guarantors of any Transaction Document to which it is a party or for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents except such as have been obtained and such as may be required under state securities or “Blue Sky” laws in connection with the purchase and resale of the Notes by the Initial Purchaser, (b) the continuing perfection or maintenance of the Liens in the Article 9 Collateral (hereinafter defined) created under the Original Transaction Documents or (d) the exercise by the Collateral Agent of its rights under the Original Transaction Documents and the Transaction Documents or the remedies in respect of the Article 9 Collateral pursuant to the Original Transaction Documents, except for (i) the filings referred to in Paragraph 7, (ii) the recording of the Modifications to the Mortgages in the real property records of the county in which the real property subject to such Mortgages is located and (iii) Governmental Authorization not required to consummate the transactions occurring on the date hereof but required to be obtained or made after the date of this opinion letter to enable the Company and the Guarantors to comply with requirements of Applicable Law, including those required to maintain existence and good standing of the Company and the Guarantors. 

“Governmental Authorization” means any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority pursuant to any Applicable Law. 

^Each Transaction Document is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of the Company and the Covered Guarantors, and other than with respect to the Purchase Agreement, enforceable against the Company and the Covered Guarantors in accordance with their terms. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each [Uncovered Party] of each Transaction Document to which it is a party, each such Transaction Document is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Uncovered Party that is a party thereto, and other than with respect to the Purchase Agreement, enforceable against such Uncovered Party in accordance with their terms. 

^The security interest created in favor of the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Trademark Security Agreement, the Copyright Security Agreement and the Gaming Pledge Agreement (the “Article 9 Security Interest”) in the Collateral described therein in which a security interest may be created under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York (the “NYUCC”) (the “Article 9 Collateral”) will also secure the amounts due under the Additional Notes (the “Additional Amounts”) and such Additional Amounts shall be Secured Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement, the Trademark Security Agreement, the Copyright Security Agreement and the Gaming Pledge Agreement). 

^Each of the financing statements indicating an Opinion Party as debtor, and the Collateral Agent as secured party, and filed with the Secretary of the State of Delaware or Texas, as applicable (the “Financing Statements”) will remain effective to perfect the Article 9 Security Interest with respect to securing the Additional Amounts with the same priority in that portion of the Article 9 Collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by filing a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of Delaware (the “Delaware UCC”) and the State of Texas, (the “Texas UCC”). 

Definition will include all Guarantors incorporated in jurisdictions other than Delaware and Texas, as well as other parties to the Transaction Documents, including Initial Purchaser, Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent, etc.

^The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents does not in any way adversely affect the creation or perfection of the Article 9 Security Interest in the Article 9 Collateral that existed immediately prior to the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents. 

^Each of the Modifications to the Mortgages to be recorded by the applicable County Clerks of the State of Texas is in proper form (i) to be accepted for recording by the County Clerks of such Counties and (ii) upon such recording, to provide notice to third parties of the mortgage liens (including the Additional Amounts) on the interest of the Company or the Guarantor party to such Mortgage in the Real Property Collateral. Each such Mortgage, as modified by the Modification, constitute a fixture financing statement for purposes of the Texas UCC. 

^Neither the Company nor any Guarantor is or will be as a result of the Transactions, an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission thereunder. 

^The issuance and sale by the Company of the Notes as contemplated by the Purchase Agreement does not violate Regulation T, U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 

^The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company is as set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package under the caption “Capitalization.” 

^The Indenture is in sufficient form for qualification under the TIA. 

^The Notes and the Note Guarantees are in the form contemplated by the Indenture. The execution, delivery and performance of the Private Exchange Notes and the Private Exchange Guarantees have been duly and validly authorized by the Company and the Covered Guarantors, and when executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantors in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement and the Indenture (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Registration Rights Agreement and the Indenture by the Trustee and due authentication and delivery of such guarantees by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture), will be legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, the Collateral Agreements and the Registration Rights Agreement, and enforceable against each of the Company and the Guarantors in accordance with their terms. 

^The statements in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package under the caption “*Description of Exchange Notes*” to the extent that such information constitute a summary of the legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present in all material respects such legal matters, documents and proceedings. The statements under the caption and “*Certain Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations*,” in the Pricing Disclosure Package, insofar as such statements summarize certain federal income and estate tax laws of the United States, constitute a fair summary of the principal U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences of an investment in the Notes. 

^No registration under the Act of the Notes is required in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchaser as contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and the Pricing Disclosure Package or in connection with the initial resale of the Notes by the Initial Purchaser in accordance with Section 6 of the Purchase Agreement, and the Indenture is not required to be qualified under the TIA, in each case assuming (i) (A) that the purchasers who buy the Notes in the initial resale thereof are qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A promulgated under the Act or (B) that the offer or sale of the Notes is made in an offshore transaction as defined in Regulation S, (ii) the accuracy of such Initial Purchaser’s representations in Section 6 of the Purchase Agreement and those of the Company contained in the Purchase Agreement regarding the absence of a general solicitation in connection with the sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchaser and the initial resale thereof and (iii) the due performance by the Initial Purchaser of the agreements set forth in Section 6 of the Purchase Agreement. 

We have participated in conferences with officers of the Company, representatives of the independent certified public accountants of the Company, and representatives of the Initial Purchaser and its counsel, at which conferences the contents of the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Company Additional Written Communication and related matters were discussed and, although we have not independently verified and are not passing upon and assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Company Additional Written Communication, on the basis of the foregoing, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Company Additional Written Communication as of its date contained, or on the Closing Date contains, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that we express no view with respect to the financial statements and notes thereto or other financial data included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Company Additional Written Communication).

^Landry’s Downtown Aquarium, Inc. (“LDA”) is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Colorado. 

^LDA has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. 

^The Transaction Documents to which LDA is a party have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of LDA, and have been duly executed and delivered by LDA.

^LSHC has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. 

^The Transaction Documents governed by Colorado law to which LSHC is a party have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of LSHC and have been duly executed and delivered by LSHC. 

^The LSHC Deed of Trust, as modified by the LSHC Modification, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of LSHC, enforceable against LSHC in accordance with its terms. 

^The execution and delivery by LSHC of the Transaction documents to which it is a party do not, and performance by LSHC of its obligations thereunder will not (a) violate its articles of incorporation, or its bylaws, (b) violate the provisions of any United States Federal or State Colorado statute, rule or regulation known to us to be applicable to LSHC, or (c) violate any material judgment or order of any United States Federal or State Colorado governmental authority known to us and binding upon LSHC. 

^Each of the Deeds of Trust, as modified by the Modifications, creates valid liens on and security interests in all right, title and interest of the applicable Grantor in the Property described therein and will also secure the amounts due under the Additional Notes (the “Additional Amounts”), to the extent liens and security interests can be created under the UCC and the real property laws of Colorado. 

^The Modifications are in proper form for filing and recording in the real property records maintained by the Clerks and Recorders of Colorado Counties. 

^Upon recordation set forth in Schedule I hereto, (a) the liens created by the Aquarium Deed of Trust, as modified by the Aquarium Modification, will remain perfected in all right, title and interest of LDA in that portion of the Aquarium Property consisting of real property located in Colorado, and will secure the Additional Amounts, (b) the security interest created by the Aquarium Deed of Trust will remain perfected in all right, title and interest of LDA in that portion of the Aquarium Property consisting of fixtures located in Colorado, and will secure the Additional Amounts, and (c) the security interests created by the Aquarium Deed of Trust will remain perfected in all right, title and interest of LDA in that portion of the Aquarium Property consisting of personal property with respect to which a security interest can be perfected by the filing of financing statements in Colorado under the UCC, and will secure the Additional Amounts.

^The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents does not in any way adversely affect the perfection of the security interests created in favor of the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Original Transaction Documents (the “Article 9 Security Interest”) in the Collateral described in the Original Transaction Documents in which a security interest may be created under Article 9 of the UCC (the “Article 9 Collateral”), that existed immediately prior to the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents. 

^No transfer tax, stamp tax or other fee, tax or governmental charge (other than filing and recording fees imposed by law) was required to be paid in Colorado in connection with the execution, delivery, filing or recording of the Modifications. 

^No consent of or filing with any Colorado state governmental body, agency or authority (other than the recordation and filing as set forth in Schedule I hereto) is required in connection with the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents by the Grantors. 

^The Transaction Documents generally provide that they are to be governed by the laws of the State of New York. We note that Colorado courts have applied the “most significant relationship” approach of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws for resolving conflict of laws questions in contract cases. See Wood Brothers Homes, Inc. v. Walker Adjustment Bureau, 198 Colo. 444, 601 P.2d 1369 (1979); Budd v. American Excess Insurance Company, et al., 928 F.2d 344 (10th Cir. 1991). Section 187 of the Restatement provides that the parties to a contract may stipulate to their choice of law to govern the validity of a contract and the rights created thereby and the laws of the state chosen will be applied to those issues unless it is determined that the particular issue in dispute is one that the parties could not have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement and that either: (a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties’ choice, or (b) that application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest in the issue than the chosen state, and that under Section 188 of the Restatement would be the state of applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties. Although it is not free from doubt, provided that (i) the State of New York has a substantial relationship (as that term is used in Section 187 of the Restatement) and a reasonable relation (as such term is used in Section 1-105 of the UCC) to the parties and the Transaction and (ii) the application of New York law would not be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the State of New York in the determination of particular issues, under existing precedent the choice of law provisions contained in the Transaction Documents should be given effect by the courts of the State of Colorado and the federal courts of the United States of America applying Colorado law. Because of the fundamentally factual nature of many of these issues, the unpredictability of which public policy issues may be present in a given situation, and the fact that our opinion is based solely upon our review of the documents described above, we do not opine that any court would necessarily hold that any choice of law provision is binding on the parties. We further note that the substantive laws of Colorado should be applicable to the Security Documents insofar as they relate to the issue of perfection and the effect of perfection or non-perfection of liens on and security interests in real property and fixtures and to the enforcement of the Security Documents, the procedures under which they are foreclosed, the effect of foreclosure and other matters related to the enforcement of remedies against property located in the State of Colorado. 

“Original Transaction Documents” should be defined to include all transaction documents from the [[Date 2]] transaction that included a grant of a security interest or lien in any personal property, including the Mortgages.

^^^CA Muer Corporation (“CA Muer”) is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Michigan. 

^CA Muer has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform each Transaction Document to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, and the Transaction Documents constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of CA Muer, and other than with respect to the Purchase Agreement, enforceable against CA Muer in accordance with their terms. 

^CA Muer (a) has taken all corporate actions necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of each Transaction Document to which it is a party and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and (b) has duly executed and delivered each Transaction Document to which it is a party. 

^The Modifications are in form satisfactory for recording in the Register of Deeds of the applicable County, in Michigan where the real property subject to the particular Mortgage is located and upon such recordation, the Mortgages as modified by the Modifications shall constitutes a perfected security interest in and a perfected lien upon the real property securing the amounts due under the Additional Notes (the “Additional Amounts”), including such real property constituting fixtures under the laws of the State of Michigan, or rights described therein, in each case in favor of the Collateral Agent. Each such Mortgage as modified by the Modification constitutes a Fixture Financing Statement for purposes of the Michigan UCC. 

^No Governmental Authorization (as defined below) or consent, approval authorization or order of any third party, and no notice to or filing with, any Michigan governmental or Michigan corporate authority or regulatory body, is required for (a) the due execution, delivery or performance by CA Muer of any Transaction Document to which it is or is to be a party or for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, (b) the continuing perfection or maintenance of the Liens in the Collateral (as defined in the Original Transaction Documents) in which a security interest may be created under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (the “Article 9 Collateral”) created under the Original Transaction Documents (including the priority nature thereof required under the Original Transaction Documents) or (c) the exercise by the Collateral Agent of its rights under the Original Transaction Documents and the Transaction Documents or the remedies in respect of the Article 9 Collateral pursuant to the Original Transaction Documents and the Transaction Documents, except for (i) the filings referred to in paragraphs 6 and 7 below, (ii) the filing of the Modifications in the real property records of the county in which the real property subject to such Mortgages as modified by the Modifications is located and (iii) Governmental Authorization not required to consummate the transactions occurring on the date hereof, but required to be obtained or made after the date of this opinion letter to enable CA Muer to comply with requirements of Applicable Law, including those required to maintain existence and good standing of CA Muer. 

“Original Transaction Documents” should be defined to include all transaction documents from the [[Date 2]] transaction that included a grant of a security interest or lien in any personal property, including the Mortgages.

“Governmental Authorization” means any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority pursuant to any Applicable Law. 

^The Financing Statements prepared by counsel to the Initial Purchaser listing CA Muer (and “C.A. Muer Corporation.”) as debtor and filed with the Secretary of the State of Michigan will remain effective to perfect the security interest created in favor of the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Original Transaction Documents (the “Article 9 Security Interest”) with respect to securing the Additional Amounts with the same priority in that portion of the Article 9 Collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by filing a financing statement under the Michigan UCC. 

^The Fixture Financing Statements prepared by counsel to the Initial Purchaser listing CA Muer as debtor and filed with the applicable County Clerks in the State of Michigan will remain effective to perfect the security interests with respect to securing the Additional Amounts with the same priority in the fixtures in which a security interest may be perfected by filing a fixture financing statement under the Michigan UCC. 

^The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents does not in any way adversely affect the perfection of the Article 9 Security Interest in the Article 9 Collateral that existed immediately prior to the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents. 

^The Transaction Documents generally provide that they are to be governed by the laws of the State of New York. We note that Michigan courts have applied the “most significant relationship” approach for resolving conflict of laws questions in contract cases. See Chrysler Corp. v Skyline Indus Servs, 448 Mich 113, 528 NW 2d 698 (1995). Section 187 of the Restatement provides that the parties to a contract may stipulate to their choice of law to govern the validity of a contract and the rights created thereby and the laws of the state chosen will be applied to those issues unless it is determined that the particular issue in dispute is one that the parties could not have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement and that either: (a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties’ choice, or (b) that application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest in the issue than the chosen state, and that under Section 188 of the Restatement would be the state of applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties. Although it is not free from doubt, provided that (i) the State of New York has a substantial relationship (as that term is used in Section 187 of the Restatement) and a reasonable relation (as such term is used in Section 1-105 of the UCC) to the parties and the Transaction and (ii) the application of New York law would not be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the State of New York in determination of particular issues, under existing precedent the choice of law provisions contained in the Transaction Documents should be given effect by the courts of the State of Michigan and the federal courts of the United States of America applying Michigan law. Because of the fundamentally factual nature of many of these issues, the unpredictability of which public policy issues may be present in any given situation, 

and the fact that our opinion is based solely upon our review of the documents described above, we do not opine that any court would necessarily hold that any choice of law provision is binding on the parties. We further note that the substantive laws of Michigan should be applicable to the Collateral Agreements insofar as they relate to the issue of perfection and the effect of perfection or non-perfection of liens on and security interests in real property and fixtures and to the enforcement of the Collateral Agreements, the procedures under which they are foreclosed, the effect of foreclosure and other matters related to the enforcement of remedies against property located in the State of Michigan . 

^The execution and delivery by CA Muer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party do not, and performance by CA Muer of its obligations thereunder and the Transactions contemplated thereby will not violate (a) its articles of incorporation, or bylaws, (b) violate the provisions of State of Michigan statute, rule or regulation known to us to be applicable to CA Muer, or (c) based on the Officer’s Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit A, violate any judgment or order of any United States federal or State of Michigan governmental authority known to us and binding upon CA Muer. 

^No transfer tax, stamp tax or other fee, tax or governmental charge (other than filing and recording fees imposed by law) was or is required to be paid in Michigan in connection with the execution, delivery, filing or recording of the Modifications.

^The Modification to the Deed of Trust (“Modification”) is in form sufficient to create in the Beneficiary’s favor a valid lien on the Mortgaged Property as security for all obligations of the Grantor stated in the Deed of Trust, as modified by the Modification to be so secured. 

^The Modification is in form sufficient to be recorded in the real property records of Multnomah County, Oregon. 

^Recordation of the Modification in the real property records of Multnomah County, Oregon in which the Mortgaged Property is located will constitute the only recording or filing in the State of Oregon necessary (i) to give constructive notice to third parties of the lien of the Deed of Trust as modified by the Modification upon the Mortgaged Property and (ii) to perfect a security interest in fixtures included in the Mortgaged Property, in each case, which under the laws of the State of Oregon constitute an interest in fixtures under the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted and in effect in the State of Oregon, to the extent that the Grantor’s interest in the Mortgaged Property is properly of record. 

^No transfer tax, stamp tax or other fee, tax or governmental charge (other than filing and recording fees imposed by law) was or is required to be paid in Oregon in connection with the execution, delivery, filing or recording of the Modification.
