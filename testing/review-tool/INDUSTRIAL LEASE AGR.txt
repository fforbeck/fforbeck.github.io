NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the rents, covenants and agreements herein set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

^PREMISES AND TERM. 

^^Premises. In consideration of the obligations of Landlord and Tenant set forth herein, Landlord leases to Tenant, and Tenant hereby takes from Landlord the Premises identified on Exhibit A situated on real property owned by the Landlord within the Town of Blacksburg, County of Montgomery, State of Virginia more particularly described on Exhibit B attached hereto and [[Tenant]] herein by reference (the “Property”) together with all rights, privileges, easements, appurtenances, and amenities belonging to or in any way pertaining to the Premises, to have and to hold, subject to the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease. Without limiting the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right, as appurtenant to the Premises, to use the driveways, parking, rear drive through door in the warehouse area of the Building and other common areas on the Property. As used in this Lease, Tenant’s “Proportionate Share” shall mean a fraction the numerator of which shall be the square footage of the Premises (31,300 s.f.) and the denominator of which shall be the square footage of the Building (109,000 s.f.). 

^^Term. The term of this Lease (the “Term”) shall commence on the later of (i) [[Date 2: Date]] or (ii) the first day of the month following the completion of the improvements described in Sections 1.3 and 1.4, and reflected on Exhibit C and Exhibit D attached hereto (the “Commencement Date”), and shall expire as of [[Date 3: Date]], unless terminated sooner, renewed or extended as provided herein. Notwithstanding the fact that the Commencement Date is subsequent to the effective date of this Lease, the parties agree that each have vested rights hereunder and that this Lease constitutes a binding and valid obligation of each as of the date this Lease is fully executed. In the event the Term has not commenced by [[Date 4: Date]] (“Completion Deadline Date”) because the improvements reflected on Exhibit C and Exhibit D have not been completed, Tenant may terminate this Lease and receive an immediate return of the Letter of Credit, as defined in Section 3.1.4; provided that for each day the completion of the improvements on Exhibit C and Exhibit D is delayed due to the actions of Tenant, the Completion Deadline Date shall be extended by the same number of days. 

^^Acceptance of the Premises. By taking possession of the Premises, Tenant acknowledges that: (i) it has inspected the Premises; (ii) it accepts the Premises as is, except for the separation improvements as indicated on Exhibit C to be installed by Landlord at Landlord’s cost prior to the Commencement Date, in order to provide separate boundaries between the different tenants in the Building and the agreed upon Upfits in Section 1.4 which are indicated on Exhibit D attached hereto, (iii) the Premises are suitable for the purpose for which the Premises are leased; and (iv) except as otherwise set forth in this Lease (including all exhibits and attachments), no representations or warranties have been made by Landlord with respect to the Premises. Prior to the Commencement Date, it is acknowledged and agreed by Landlord that Tenant may take possession of and use the administrative offices; provided that in the event the Tenant occupies all the administrative offices, installs telephone and internet services and begins conducting permanent business from said offices, Tenant shall pay Landlord rent on the administrative office space at the annual rate of $[[USD Value 17: Number]] per sq. ft. 

^^Upfit Allowance. The Landlord shall provide the Tenant with an improvement allowance of $15.00 per sq. ft. for a maximum Up-fit allowance of Four Hundred Sixty Nine Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]) (the “Up-fit Allowance”). Landlord and Tenant agree that should the Tenant’s desired improvements exceed the Up-fit Allowance, the Tenant shall provide to the Landlord the additional funds required to pay for the additional improvements. Should the desired improvements by the Tenant exceed the Up-fit Allowance, the Landlord shall have no obligation to enter into any contract for the agreed upon Up-fit work until such time that the Tenant provides the additional funds in excess of the Up-fit Allowance. Should the Tenant not provide the Landlord with the additional funds in excess of the Up-fit Allowance within five (5) calendar days of receiving written notice from the Landlord that the funds are due, the Landlord may deem the Tenant in default and the Landlord may, in addition to any other remedy available, use the deposit money and/or Letter of Credit to pay all the architectural and engineering fees incurred up to the date of default. The list of improvements to be preformed by the Landlord prior to Commencement Date are indicated on Exhibit D and are [[Tenant]] herein as a part of this Lease. 

^RENEWAL; EXTENSION; SURRENDER 

^^Renewal. 

2.1.1 Tenant shall have the option to renew this Lease for an additional term of five (5) years on the same terms, covenants and conditions set forth herein (the “Renewal Term”); provided (i) that this Lease is in full force and effect immediately prior to the date of the commencement of the Renewal Term and that the Tenant is not in default, beyond applicable cure periods, under any of the provisions of this Lease at the time option to renew is exercised by Tenant, (ii) that the Base Rent for the first year of the Renewal Term shall be increased by the percentage increase in the CPI (as defined hereinafter) during the period from [[Date 5: Date]] to [[Date 3]], and the Base Rent for each lease year thereafter during the Renewal Term shall increase by the percentage increase in the CPI (as defined hereinafter) during the preceding lease year, and (iii) the Common Area Maintenance Fee shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 8.1.1 The term “CPI” shall mean the Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, U.S. City Average, All Items and Major Group Figures for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (1982-84 = 100), or if such index is not available, a comparable index selected by Landlord and Tenant which is published by a governmental institution or a nationally recognized publisher of statistical information. 

2.1.2 Tenant’s desire to renew this Lease for the Renewal Term set forth above shall be expressed, if at all, by delivery of written notice (the “Renewal Notice”) to Landlord no later than 240 days prior to expiration of the initial term. Time shall be of the essence with respect to Tenant’s Renewal Notice. 

^^Extension By Mutual Consent. If Tenant lawfully occupies the Premises after the end of the Term or the Renewal Term, after having requested and obtained Landlord’s written consent to do so, this Lease and all its terms, provisions, conditions, covenants, waivers, remedies and any and all of Landlord’s rights herein specifically given and agreed to, shall be in force for one month thereafter and thereafter from month-to-month until either party gives the other thirty (30) days written notice of its desire to terminate this Lease. 

^^Surrender. At the expiration of this Lease (including any renewal or extension) or the sooner termination thereof, Tenant shall surrender the Premises to Landlord, together with all additions, alterations and improvements thereto, in broom clean condition and in good order and repair except for ordinary wear and tear, casualty damage not caused by Tenant, and Landlord’s maintenance obligations.

Tenant shall be entitled to no payment or offset for the value of any abandoned property (even if sold by Landlord) and Tenant shall pay on demand all reasonable costs incurred by Landlord in connection with such removal or disposal. No retention, disposal or sale of such abandoned property shall limit remedies otherwise available to Landlord hereunder for a breach of this Agreement by Tenant. All obligations of Tenant hereunder not fully performed as of the termination or expiration of the Lease shall survive such termination or expiration, until they are performed. 

^^Holding Over. If Tenant occupies the Premises beyond the Term of this Lease or the properly exercised Renewal Term, without Landlord’s written consent (a “Hold Over”), Tenant shall be deemed to occupy the Premises as a tenant at sufferance, and all of the terms and provisions of this Lease shall be applicable during that period, except that Tenant shall pay Landlord a rental equal to one hundred twenty-five percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the monthly Base Rent applicable hereunder at the expiration of the Term or applicable Renewal Term, prorated for the number of days of such holding over.

3.1.2 Proration. In the event that the date on which a payment obligation: (i) begins on a date other than the first day of a calendar month; or (ii) ends on a date other than the last day of a calendar month then the amount of the payment shall be prorated, based upon the number of days during said month that the obligation was effective.

Landlord agrees that the Letter of Credit may be issued and renewed on an annual basis; provided that in the event Tenant fails to provide Landlord with a renewal Letter of Credit within ten (10) days prior to the termination of any then existing Letter of Credit, an Event of Default as defined in Section 13.1 shall be deemed to have occurred. The Letter of Credit shall be provided in a satisfactory form to the Landlord and be governed by the “Uniform Customs and Practices for Commercial Documentary Credits” promulgated by the XIII Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce (International Chamber of Commerce Brochure No. 500, 1993 revision) and the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code-Letters of CreditTitle 8.5 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended.

In the event that there is a utility interruption or stoppage for more than one (1) business day, the Base Rent due hereunder shall be abated until such interruption or stoppage is corrected. In addition to the Base Rent, the Tenant shall pay Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the utilities provided by Landlord (the “Utility Fee”). For the first six months following the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay $[[USD Value 6: Number]] per month based on an annual Utility Fee equal to $[[USD Value 18: Number]] per square foot.

In the event the actual amount of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the water, sewer, electric, and natural gas utility usage provided by Landlord during the six month period exceeds the $[[USD Value 18]] per square foot amount, Tenant shall pay Landlord the difference within thirty (30) days following Tenant’s receipt of evidence of the difference. In the event the actual amount of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the water, sewer, electric, and natural gas utility usage provided by Landlord during the six month period following the Commencement Date is less than the annual $[[USD Value 18]] per square foot amount, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant the difference within thirty (30) days following Landlord’s determination that the amount is less. For the twelve (12) month period following the Reallocation Date, Tenant shall pay a Utility Fee based on the monthly average during the preceding six month period.

For each twelve month (12) month period thereafter, Tenant shall pay a monthly Utility Fee based on the actual amount of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the water, sewer, electric, and natural gas utility usage provided by Landlord during the preceding twelve (12) month period. At the end of each period, Landlord shall determine the actual amount of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the water, sewer, electric, and natural gas utility usage provided by Landlord during the preceding twelve (12) month period, and either Tenant shall pay to Landlord any increase in the actual amount of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the water, sewer, electric, and natural gas utility usage provided by Landlord during the preceding twelve (12) month period or Landlord shall reimburse Tenant the decrease in the actual amount of Tenant’s 

Proportionate Share of the water, sewer, electric, and natural gas utility usage provided by Landlord during the preceding twelve (12) month period. It is acknowledged and agreed by Landlord that Tenant shall not share in the cost and expense of the water, sewer, electric and natural gas utility usage which is separately metered to any other tenant in the Building.

^ALTERATIONS 

^^Tenant shall not make any alterations, additions or improvements to the Premises, except for non-structural alterations that cost less than $[[USD Value 7: Number]] per project without the prior written consent of Landlord, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Tenant, at its own cost and expense, may erect shelves, bins, machinery and trade fixtures as it desires provided that (a) such items do not alter the basic character of the Premises or the Building; (b) such items do not overload or damage the same; (c) such items may be removed without material injury to the Premises; and (d) the construction, erection or installation thereof complies with all applicable governmental laws, ordinances, regulations and all provisions of this Lease. All alterations, additions, improvements and partitions erected by Tenant shall be and remain the property of Tenant during the Term of this Lease and shall be the property of Landlord upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease provided that nothing herein shall prohibit Tenant from removing the Tenant Equipment or other items, in accordance with Section 2.3, above. All shelves, bins, machinery and trade fixtures installed by Tenant shall be removed in accordance with Section 2.3 within 30 days following the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, at which time Tenant shall repair any damage caused thereby, ordinary wear and tear excepted. All alterations, installations, removals and restoration shall be performed in a good, workmanlike and lien free manner.

Tenant has no express or implied authority to create or place any lien or encumbrance of any kind upon, or in any manner to bind the interest of Landlord in the Premises or to charge the rentals payable hereunder for any claim in favor of any person dealing with Tenant, including, without limitation, those who may furnish materials or perform labor for any construction or repairs requested by Tenant. 

^SIGNAGE Tenant shall not place or permit on any exterior door or window or any exterior wall of the Premises any sign, awning, canopy, advertising matter or lettering or at the entrance to the Property without the written consent of the Landlord, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. It shall not be unreasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to the placement of any sign that does not comply with any federal, state or local law or ordinance. 

^MAINTENANCE 

^^Tenant’s Maintenance Responsibilities. Tenant shall at all times keep the Premises and all partitions, fixtures, equipment and appurtenances thereof and all parts of the Premises not required in Section 8.2 to be maintained by Landlord in good order, condition and repair, and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, ordinances and regulations, damage by casualty excepted. If replacement of equipment, fixtures and appurtenances thereto are necessary, Tenant shall replace the same with equipment, fixtures and appurtenances of the same quality, and shall repair all damages done in or by such replacement. 

8.1.1 Common Area Maintenance Fee: Tenant shall pay, in addition to the Base Rent, a fixed monthly fee in the amount of $912.91, based on an annual charge of $[[USD Value 19: Number]] per sq. ft, to cover the cost incurred by Landlord to maintain the common areas (which includes all restrooms, hallways, conference rooms, cafeteria, shipping and other common areas in the Building designated on Exhibit A) and exterior areas of the Building in good condition and repair, including snow removal from sidewalks and parking lots, landscaping, and grass cutting (the “Common Area Maintenance Fee”). In the event Tenant elects to renew the term of this Lease, Landlord shall provide Tenant written evidence showing the actual costs paid by Landlord to maintain the common and exterior areas of the Building for the twelve month period preceding the first day of the Renewal Term. The Common Area Maintenance Fee to be paid annually by Tenant during the Renewal Term shall be adjusted to equal Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the actual costs paid by Landlord to maintain the common and exterior areas of the Building for the twelve month period preceding the first day of the Renewal Term, provided that the Common Area Maintenance Fee for the Renewal Term shall not exceed an annual charge of $[[USD Value 20: Number]] per sq. ft. 

^^Landlord’s Maintenance Responsibilities. Landlord shall provide and keep or cause to be kept, at Landlord’s sole cost and expense, the HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems (including any portion of the systems and the equipment related thereto located within the Premises) and all structural portions of the Building, including without limitation, the foundation, roof, and all load bearing and exterior walls, in good order, condition and repair, except for damage thereto due to the negligence of Tenant, Tenant’s employees or invitees. The term “exterior walls” as used herein shall include windows, glass or plate glass, doors or overhead doors, special store fronts, dock bumpers and dock plates or levelers. Landlord shall keep or cause to be kept the parking area(s), and sidewalks in good order, condition and repair; provided Tenant shall be responsible for repairing any damage caused by Tenant, its employees or invitees. Tenant shall immediately give Landlord written notice of defect or need for repairs, after which Landlord shall commence such repairs as soon as reasonably practicable. 

If the parties so agree, Tenant may perform any maintenance or repair that is Landlord’s responsibility hereunder, and Landlord shall pay the cost for the maintenance or repair within thirty (30) days following receipt of an invoice from the Tenant. 

^^Landlord’s Failure to Make Repairs. If Landlord fails to commence any repair as required under Section 8.2 within ten (10) days after notification of the need for such repair, and fails to complete such repairs within a reasonable period of time, Tenant may, in addition to any other remedies it may have, make such repairs at the expense of Landlord and Landlord shall pay to Tenant all costs and expenses reasonably incurred as a result of such repairs within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice thereof. In the event of a bona fide emergency which may result in damage or injury to persons or Tenant’s property, damage which has a material impact on Tenant’s ability to conduct business as contemplated under this Agreement, or damage which otherwise exposes Tenant (in Tenant’s reasonable judgment) to liability, Tenant may, unless Landlord commences and diligently pursues such repairs within five (5) days after receipt of written notice (or such shorter period as would reasonably be expected under the given circumstances), make such repairs on behalf of Landlord and Landlord shall pay to Tenant all costs and expenses reasonably incurred in making such repairs within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice thereof. 

^ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING 

^^Assignment or Subletting by Tenant. Tenant shall not, either voluntarily or by operation of law, assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or encumber this Lease, or any interest therein, and shall not sublet the Premises, or any part thereof, without obtaining the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In connection with any such assignment or sublease, Tenant or the assignee or subtenant of Tenant shall pay to Landlord any legal and administrative costs incurred by Landlord in approving such assignment or subletting, not to exceed $750.00. The acceptance of rent from any other party shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any of the provisions of this Lease, or deemed consent to the assignment or subletting of the Premises. Consent to any assignment or subletting shall not be deemed consent to any future assignment or subletting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the absolute right (without obtaining Landlord’s prior written consent which shall not be required) to assign this Lease in whole or in part or to sublet all or any portion of the Premises to: any affiliate controlling, controlled by or under common control with Tenant; an entity into which Tenant merges or consolidates; or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of the assets of Tenant, if the assignee or sublessee agrees, in writing delivered to Landlord, to abide by all the provisions under this Lease. 

^^Assignment by Landlord. Landlord may assign this Lease, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Tenant, provided that such assignment does affect or impair the rights granted to Tenant herein, or adversely affect Tenant’s possession of the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Lease is assigned, in whole or in part, by The Industrial Development Authority of Montgomery County, 

Virginia, any subsequent assignment of this Lease, in whole or in part, shall require the prior written consent of Tenant. 

^^Assignment pursuant to Provision of the Bankruptcy Code. If this Lease is assigned to any person or entity pursuant to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. sec. 101 et seq), any and all monies or other considerations payable or otherwise to be delivered in connection with such assignment shall be paid or delivered to the Landlord and shall be and remain the exclusive property of the Landlord and shall not constitute the property of the Tenant or the estate of the Tenant, within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code. 

^RIGHT OF ENTRY Landlord, its employees and agents, shall have the right to enter the Premises with a designated representative of Tenant upon reasonable notice during regular business hours for the purpose of examining or inspecting the same, showing the same to prospective purchasers, mortgagees or tenants of the Premises, and to perform its maintenance obligations under Section 8.2, above. In the case of a bona fide emergency, Landlord shall use its best efforts to provide Tenant with the greatest possible notice under the circumstances prior to entering the Premises and in the event that representatives of Tenant are not present to accompany Landlord or to open and permit entry into the Premises during the course of a bona fide emergency, then Landlord may enter the Premises forcibly and without being accompanied by a representative of Tenant without such entry constituting an eviction of Tenant or termination of this Lease. Except in the case of a bona fide emergency, Landlord, its employees and agents shall abide by all reasonable security and safety procedures established for the Premises by Tenant. 

^INSURANCE 

^^Landlord’s Obligations. Throughout the Term of this Lease, including any renewals or extensions thereof, Landlord shall maintain the following insurance coverage: (i) standard all risk coverage in an amount equal to the replacement cost of the Building; (ii) Commercial General Liability of not less than $[[USD Value 8: Number]] per occurrence and $[[USD Value 9: Number]] aggregate, naming Tenant as an additional insured; (iii) boiler insurance with coverage and in an amount reasonably satisfactory to Tenant: and (iv) at Landlord’s discretion, such other insurance policies as may be deemed normal and customary for substantially similar buildings, including but not limited to coverage for loss of rent. All insurance coverage shall be primary and non-contributory and issued by insurers licensed to do business in the state in which the Premises are located. The insurance required of Landlord hereunder may be maintained by a blanket or master policy, which includes properties other than the Premises. 

^^Tenant’s Obligations. 

11.2.1 Tenant shall keep in effect at Tenant’s expense during the term of this Lease: (i) all risk property insurance covering the full replacement cost of Tenant’s Equipment and all other property and improvements installed or placed in the Premises by Tenant at Tenant’s expense; (ii) worker’s compensation insurance with no less than the minimum limits required by law; (iii) employer’s liability insurance with such limits as required by law; and (iv) commercial general liability insurance with a minimum limit of $[[USD Value 8]] per occurrence and $[[USD Value 9]] aggregate. All such policies and coverage shall be primary and non-contributory, issued by insurers, licensed to do business in the state in which the Premises are located and which are rated A- or better by Best’s Key Rating Guide, endorsed to include Landlord as additional insured (Commercial General Liability only), and endorsed to provide at least 30-days prior notification of cancellation or material change in coverage to said Landlord. Tenant may comply with its insurance obligations hereunder in whole or in part through a company-wide program of self-insurance and may maintain company-wide levels of deductibles provided the Tenant provides Landlord with an appropriate self-insurance certificate. 

11.2.2 Fire and Casualty Insurance. Tenant shall not do or suffer to be done any act, matter or thing whereby the fire and casualty insurance carried by Landlord on the Building of which the Premises are a part shall be suspended or rated as more hazardous than at the commencement of this Lease. In case of breach of this covenant, Tenant agrees to pay, within thirty (30) days of receipt of written demand, any and all increase of premium for fire and casualty insurance carried by Landlord caused directly by the actions or occupancy of Tenant. 

^DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION OF LEASED PREMISES 

^^If the Premises are damaged by fire or any other cause which renders the Premises completely untenantable, in Tenant’s reasonable determination, then Tenant by a notice in writing sent no later than thirty (30) days after such damage may terminate this Lease as of the date of such damage, and any Base Rent or other amounts for the unexpired period paid in advance beyond the date of such damage, shall be refunded by Landlord to Tenant and the original Letter of Credit shall be returned promptly to Tenant. 

^^If Tenant does not elect to terminate this Lease as provided in Section 12.1 or if the Premises are not rendered completely untenantable, Landlord shall diligently commence restoration and restore the Premises to a condition equal to its condition before the damage; provided that Landlord’s obligation to repair and restore the Premises is contingent upon its receipt of insurance proceeds sufficient to make such repairs. In the event any mortgagee or lender requires any insurance proceeds to be applied to any debt, Landlord shall not be deemed to have received the proceeds, in which event Tenant may terminate this Lease unless Landlord agrees to fund the repairs. If Landlord completes such repairs, then Tenant shall promptly repair or replace its trade fixtures, furnishings, furniture, carpeting, wall covering, floor covering, drapes and equipment to the same condition as they were in immediately prior to the casualty. The Base Rent and other amounts owed hereunder, according to the extent that such damage and its repair shall interfere with the full enjoyment and use of the Premises, shall be suspended and abated from the date of such damage until Landlord’s repairs have been completed. In the event that the Premises have not been restored to a condition equal to their condition before the damage within ninety (90) days after Landlord’s receipt of the proceeds, then Tenant may, by a notice in writing sent prior to completion of restoration, terminate this Lease as of the date of such termination, and any Base Rent or other amounts for the unexpired period paid in advance beyond the date of such damage, shall be refunded by Landlord to Tenant and the original Letter of Credit shall be returned promptly to Tenant.

The following shall be considered an “Event of Default” and a breach of this Lease: (a) any failure of Tenant to pay any Base Rent, the Utility Fee, the Common Area Maintenance Fee, the money in the excess of the Up-fit Allowance or other amounts due hereunder for more than five (5) business days after receipt of written notice of non-payment; (b) any failure by Tenant to perform or observe any of the other terms, provisions, conditions and covenants of this Lease for more than thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such failure provided, however, that if the event for which the notice is given is of a nature that may not be reasonably cured within said thirty (30) day period, Tenant shall not be in default for so long as Tenant commences to cure the default within the thirty (30) day period and diligently pursues it to conclusion; (c) Tenant files a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy which is not dismissed within thirty (30) days of the filing or makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (d) a receiver of any property of Tenant in or upon the Premises is appointed in any action, suit, or proceeding by or against Tenant and such appointment shall not be vacated or annulled within sixty (60) days; or (e) this Lease, Tenant’s interest herein or in the Premises, any improvements thereon, or any property of Tenant is executed upon or attached. 

^^Landlord’s Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in Section 13.1, Landlord, in addition to all other rights or remedies Landlord may have for such default at law or in equity, shall have the right to pursue any one or more of the following remedies. 

13.2.1 Terminate this Lease and, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in Base Rent or other amounts owed hereunder, enter upon and take possession of the Premises by summary dispossession proceedings or any other method authorized by law and recover from Tenant through the Deposit money paid pursuant to Paragraph 3.1.3 and/or the Letter of Credit provided pursuant to Paragraph 3.1.4 or by other legal means: (i) all Base Rent and other amounts due and unpaid up to the time of re-entry; (ii) the costs of repairing or otherwise putting the Premises into the condition required by this Lease; and (iii) Tenant shall continue to be liable to pay the Base Rent and other amounts owed hereunder as they become due, reduce by Landlord’s net re-letting proceeds. 

13.2.2 Without terminating this Lease, enter upon and take possession of the Premises, by summary dispossession proceedings or any other remedy authorized by law and re-let the Premises, or any part thereof, for such term or terms (which may extend beyond the term of this Lease), for the highest rent reasonably obtainable (even if such rent is below market value) and to recover from Tenant the difference between the Base Rent reserved by this Lease and the amount obtained through such re-letting plus the following costs, if reasonably incurred by Landlord in such re-letting: (a) brokerage fees and/or leasing commissions; (b) the costs of removing and storing Tenant’s or any other occupant’s property; and (c) the costs of repairing or otherwise putting the Premises into the condition required by this Lease together with the costs of alterations reasonably necessary to re-let the Premises. No such re-letting shall relieve Tenant from its obligations hereunder. In no event shall Tenant be entitled to any excess rent obtained by re-letting the Premises over and above the Base Rent reserved herein. 

^^If the Tenant shall continue in default in the performance of any of the covenants or agreements herein contained, after any applicable cure period, Landlord may perform the same for the account of Tenant. Any amount incurred by Landlord in the performance of any such matter for the account of Tenant shall be payable by Tenant to Landlord within thirty (30) days after written demand and evidence that the same has been paid. 

^^No re-entry or taking possession of the Premises by Landlord shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease unless Landlord sends a written notice of termination to Tenant. Pursuit of any of the foregoing remedies shall not preclude pursuit of any of the other remedies herein provided or any other remedies provided by at law or in equity, nor shall pursuit of any remedy herein provided constitute a forfeiture or waiver of any Base Rent, or other amounts due to Landlord hereunder or of any damages accruing to Landlord. 

^REMEDIES OF TENANT UPON LANDLORD’S DEFAULT 

^^Landlord shall be in default of this Lease (a “Landlord Default”) if it shall fail to perform any duty or obligation imposed upon it by this Lease and such failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice, provided, however, that if the event for which the notice is given is of a nature that may not reasonably be performed within said thirty (30) day period, Landlord shall not be in default for so long as Landlord commences its performance within said thirty day period and diligently pursues it to conclusion. Upon the occurrence of a Landlord Default, Tenant, in addition to all other rights or remedies Tenant may have for such default at law or in equity, shall have the right to exercise any self-help measures as may be reasonably necessary to cure such default. Landlord shall reimburse any costs and expenses incurred by Tenant in order to cure a Landlord Default within thirty (30) days after written demand and evidence that the same has been paid. In addition, if Landlord fails to cure any default within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of the default, Tenant shall have the right, upon written notice to Landlord, to terminate this Lease without penalty or further obligation to Landlord, its employees, officers, agents or lenders. 

^^All obligations of Landlord under this Lease will be deemed binding upon Landlord only during the period of its ownership of the Premises and not thereafter; provided that Landlord or any subsequent owner of the Premises shall not be released from any liability arising under this Lease during such parties’ ownership of the Premises. 

^EMINENT DOMAIN In the event that the Premises, in whole or in part, are taken by paramount governmental authority or in any way condemned or appropriated by the exercise of the right of eminent domain or a deed or conveyance in lieu of eminent domain (each a “Taking”) such that Tenant’s is unable to use the Premises for the purposes set forth herein, Tenant shall have the right, at its option, within sixty (60) days after said Taking, to terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Landlord. In the event Tenant elects to terminate the Lease, the Base Rent and other amounts owed under this Lease shall be abated from the date of the Taking, and Tenant’s liability therefore will cease as of the date of such termination, and any prepaid Base Rent or other amounts shall be returned to Tenant, along with the original Letter of Credit. If this Lease is not terminated as provided in this Section 15 then it shall continue in full force and effect (provided no Base Rent or other amounts shall be owed by Tenant until the remainder of the Premises are restored, however, Tenant shall pay prorata Base Rent on any space Tenant occupies prior to the restoration of the Premises), and Landlord shall within a reasonable time after possession is physically taken by the condemning authority restore the remaining portion of the Premises to render it reasonably suitable for the uses permitted by this Lease and the Base Rent and other amounts owed hereunder shall be proportionately and equitably reduced. If the proceeds received in connection with the Taking are not sufficient to restore the remaining portion of the Premises to render it suitable for the uses permitted by this Lease and the Landlord is unwilling to pay the difference, Tenant may terminate this Lease. In the event any mortgagee or lender requires that all or any portion of the proceeds received from the condemning authority be applied to any debt, Landlord will not be deemed to have received such proceeds. All compensation awarded in connection with or as a result of a Taking shall be the property of the Landlord, except that Tenant may apply for and keep as its property a separate award for: (i) the value of Tenant’s leasehold interest; (ii) the value of Tenant Equipment or Tenant’s trade fixtures or personal property; (iii) Tenant’s moving expenses; (iv) Tenant’s business relocation expenses; and (v) damages to Tenant’s business incurred as a result of such Taking. 

^SUBORDINATION OF LEASE 

^^This Lease is and shall remain subordinate and subject to any mortgage or mortgages or deed of trust which are now, or at any time hereafter shall be placed, upon the interest of Landlord in the Premises or any part thereof or to any assignment of the interest of Landlord in this Lease; provided that the holder thereof shall execute and deliver to Tenant a non-disturbance agreement in form reasonably acceptable to Tenant. Tenant agrees to execute and deliver to Landlord, without cost, any instrument that may be deemed necessary by Landlord to further effect the subordination of this Lease to any such mortgage, mortgages or assignments in form reasonably acceptable to Tenant. 

^^In the event of a foreclosure of any such mortgage, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that this Lease shall not terminate by reason thereof, and Tenant further agrees to recognize as Landlord hereunder the mortgagee or purchaser at a foreclosure sale for the balance of the Term, the Renewal Term or an extension of either, subject to all the terms and provisions hereof; provided, however, that any such mortgagee or purchaser at a foreclosure sale, which shall become the Landlord hereunder, shall not be: 

^^liable for acts or omissions of Landlord occurring prior to its ownership of the Premises (but such mortgagee or purchaser shall perform any unperformed obligations under this Lease existing at the time it becomes Landlord); 

^^subject to any offsets or defenses which Tenant might have against Landlord that accrue prior to its ownership of the Premises, except as provided in this Lease; 

^^bound by any Base Rent or other amounts which Tenant may have paid to Landlord more than thirty days in advance (other than the security deposit); or 

^^bound by any amendment or modifications of said Lease made after Tenant receives written notice of such foreclosure. 

^ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE Either party shall, at any time and from time to time within twenty (20) days following receipt of written request from the other party, execute, acknowledge and deliver to the requesting party a written statement certifying that this Lease is in full force and effect and unmodified (or, if modified, stating the nature of such modification), certifying the date to which the Base Rent reserved hereunder has been paid, and certifying that there are not, to the responding party’s knowledge, any uncured defaults on the part of the party requesting the certificate, or specifying such defaults if any are claimed. Such a statement may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser, mortgagee or subtenant of all or any portion of the Premises. The responding party’s failure to deliver such statement within said twenty-day period shall be conclusive upon such party that this Lease is in full force and effect and unmodified, and that there are no uncured defaults in the requesting party’s performance hereunder. 

^RULES AND REGULATIONS Tenant and Tenant’s agents, employees and invitees shall faithfully observe and comply with all reasonable, uniform rules and regulations promulgated by Landlord from time to time for the safety, care or cleanliness of the Premises and for the preservation of good order therein, provided that such rules and regulations do not materially increase Tenant’s duties or obligations under this Lease. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Lease and any rules and regulations promulgated by Landlord, the conflict or inconsistency shall be resolved by giving precedence to the terms and conditions of this Lease. 

^QUIET ENJOYMENT Landlord represents and warrants that it has the authority to enter into this Lease. Landlord further represents, warrants and covenants that so long as Tenant pays all amounts due hereunder and performs all other material covenants and conditions of this Lease to be performed by the Tenant hereunder, Landlord and its successors and assigns shall not interfere, nor permit interference, with Tenant’s quiet use and enjoyment of the Premises and that, subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises for the Term hereof.

In addition to the required deposit, the Tenant shall cause to be put in place within five (5) business days following written notice from Landlord that construction of the improvements shown on Exhibit C and Exhibit D is ready to commence and shall remain continuously in place until the end of the Term, unless otherwise provided herein or agreed by the Landlord, a letter of credit issued by a Bank in the area that is acceptable to the Landlord in the amount of Seven Hundred Nineteen Thousand Five Hundred ($[[USD Value 10]]), against which the Landlord may draw upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in Section 13.1, by Tenant under this Lease (the “Letter of Credit”). Landlord agrees that the Letter of Credit may be issued and renewed on an annual basis; provided that in the event Tenant fails to provide Landlord with a renewal Letter of Credit within thirty (30) days prior to the termination of any then existing Letter of Credit, an Event of Default as defined in Section 13.1 shall be deemed to have occurred. The Letter of Credit shall be provided in a satisfactory form to the Landlord and be governed by the “Uniform Customs and Practices for Commercial Documentary Credits” promulgated by the XIII Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce (International Chamber of Commerce Brochure No. 500, 1993 revision) and the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code-Letters of CreditTitle 8.5 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended.

^This Amendment may be executed in any number of identical counterparts and, as so executed, shall constitute one agreement, binding on all the parties hereto, notwithstanding that all the parties are not signatories to the original or the same counterpart. 

^Except as specifically amended herein, the Lease shall remain in full force and effect.

\centered **THIRD AMENDMENT TO INDUSTRIAL LEASE AGREEMENT** 

THIS THIRD AMENDMENT TO INDUSTRIAL LEASE AGREEMENT (the “Amendment”) is made and effective this [[Date 21: Date]], by and between The Economic Development Authority of Montgomery County, Virginia (“Landlord”), formerly known as The Industrial Development Authority of Montgomery County a public body corporate, having a principal place of business at 755 [[Address 1: Address]], Suite 2 H [[Address 2: Address]], and Luna Innovations [[Tenant]] (“Tenant”), a Virginia corporation having a principal place of business at 1 Riverside Circle, Suite 400, [[Address 9: Address]]. 

^Introduction. Landlord and Tenant previously entered into that certain Industrial Lease Agreement dated as of the [[Date 1]], as amended by the First Amendment dated effective as of [[Date 22: Date]], and as amended by the Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) dated effective as of [[Date 23: Date]] (as amended, the “Lease”). Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Lease. Section 3.1.4 of the original Lease provided for a Letter of Credit against which Landlord could draw upon an Event of Default; the Second Amendment amended the Lease to replace the Letter of Credit with funds deposited in a cash escrow account held by Landlord to serve the same purpose. By this Amendment, the parties wish to amend Section 3.1.4 of the Lease to replace the cash escrow with a Letter of Credit against which Landlord may draw upon an event of default, and to release the funds currently held in escrow. Now, therefore, in consideration of the rents, covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Lease, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree to the following terms. 

^Amendment. Section 3.1.4 of the Lease is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 

3.1.4 Letter of Credit. Tenant shall deliver a letter of credit issued by a Bank reasonably acceptable to Landlord in the amount of $[[USD Value 15: Number]] against which Landlord may draw upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined by Section 13.1, by Tenant under this Lease (the “Letter of Credit”). This Letter of Credit shall be maintained throughout the Term, subject to the following provisions. Landlord agrees that the Letter of Credit may be issued and renewed on annual basis; provided that in the event Tenant fails to provide Landlord with a renewal Letter of Credit within thirty (30) days prior to the termination of any then-existing Letter of Credit, an Event of Default as defined in Section 13.1 shall be deemed to have occurred. The Letter of Credit shall be provided in satisfactory form to Landlord and be governed by the “Uniform Customs and Practices for Commercial Documentary Credits” promulgated by the XIII Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce (International Chamber of Commerce Brochure No. 500, 1993 revision) and the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code  Letters of Credit  Title 8.5 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. So long as Tenant is in good standing under 

the Lease, the amount of the Letter of Credit shall automatically be reduced by $[[USD Value 13]] on [[Date 15]], and on [[Date 16]], no Letter of Credit shall be further required. 

Any other references in the original Lease to the Letter of Credit shall hereby be deemed to continue to refer to the Letter of Credit, notwithstanding the Second Amendment. 

^Release of Funds from Escrow. Upon receipt by Landlord of the Letter of Credit re-established by Section 2 above, the $[[USD Value 16: Number]] in funds held in the escrow deposit account (plus accrued interest, if any) established by the Second Amendment shall immediately be released and payable to Tenant. 

^Miscellaneous. 

This Amendment may be executed in any number of identical counterparts and, as so executed, shall constitute one agreement, binding on all the parties hereto, notwithstanding that all the parties are not signatories to the original or the same counterpart. 

Except as specifically amended herein, the Lease shall remain in full force and effect.
