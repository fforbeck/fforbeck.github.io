\centered **BYLAWS** 

\centered **OF** 

\centered **POLYCOM, INC.** 

\centered (a Delaware corporation) 

\centered **As amended through [[Date 1]]** 

\centered ***CORPORATE OFFICES*** 

^^***Registered Office***. The registered office of the corporation shall be fixed in the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation. 

^^***Other Offices***. The Board of Directors may at any time establish branch or subordinate offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business. The corporation may also have offices at such other places both within and without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the corporation may require. 

\centered ***MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS*** 

^^***Place of Meeting***. Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof. The Board of Directors may determine that a meeting shall not be held at any specific place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders’ meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. 

^^***Annual Meeting***.

^^The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. At the meeting, directors shall be elected by a plurality vote, and any other proper business may be transacted. 

^^At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be: (A) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (B) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (C) brought by a stockholder of the corporation who (1) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.2(b) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has timely complied in proper written form with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2(b). In addition, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action pursuant to these bylaws and applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (C) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders. 

^^^To comply with clause (C) of Section 2.2(b) above, a stockholder’s notice must set forth all information required under this Section 2.2(b) and must be timely received by the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the secretary of the corporation not less than 45 calendar days nor earlier than 75 calendar days before the one-year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials or a notice of availability of proxy materials (whichever is earlier) in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year’s proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of such annual meeting or ten (10) calendar days following the date on which Public Announcement (as defined below) of the date of the meeting is first made. In no event shall an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above. “Public Announcement” shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones New Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor thereto (the “1934 Act”). 

^^^To be in proper written form, a stockholder’s notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter of business the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (B) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation’s books, of the stockholder proposing such business and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below), (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person and a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting, (D) any derivative positions held or beneficially held by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person, (E) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or to manage the risk or benefit from share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the corporation, (F) any material interest of the stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person in such business, and (G) a statement whether either such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation’s voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (A) through (G), a “Business Solicitation Statement”). In addition, to be in proper written form, a stockholder’s notice to the secretary must be supplemented not later than ten days following the record date to disclose the information contained in clauses (C), (D) and (E) above as of the record date. A “Stockholder Associated Person” of any stockholder shall mean (A) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (B) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and whose behalf the proposal or nomination, as the case may be, is being made, or (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such person referred to in the preceding clauses (A) and (B)

^^^Without exception, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). In addition, business proposed to be brought by a stockholder may not be brought before the annual meeting if such stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business or if the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. 

^^Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (A) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (B) by a stockholder of the corporation who (1) was a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.2(c) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation. 

^^^To comply with clause (B) of Section 2.2(c) above, a nomination to be made by a stockholder must set forth all information required under this Section 2.2(c) and must be received by the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation at the time set forth in, and in accordance with, the final three sentences of Section 2.2(b)(i) above. 

^^^To be in proper written form, such stockholder’s notice shall set forth: 

^as to each person (a “nominee”), whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such nominee, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such nominee, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such nominee and any derivative positions held or beneficially held by such nominee, (D) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of such nominee with respect to any securities of the corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or to manage the risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such nominee with respect to any securities of the corporation, (E) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, (F) a written statement executed by the nominee acknowledging that as a director of the corporation, the nominee will owe a fiduciary duty under [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] and its stockholders, and (G) any other information relating to such nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to the proxy rules of the 1934 Act (including without limitation such nominee’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and 

^as to such stockholder giving notice, (A) the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2 (except that references therein to proposals of business shall instead refer to nominations of directors for purposes of this paragraph (c)), and (B) a statement whether either such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a number of the corporation’s voting shares reasonably believed by such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person to be necessary to elect such nominee(s) (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (A) and (B) above, a “Nominee Solicitation Statement”). 

^At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation (A) that information required to be set forth in the stockholder’s notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee as of a date subsequent to the date on which the notice of such person’s nomination was given and (B) such other information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such person to serve as a director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder’s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee; in the absence of the furnishing of such information if requested, such stockholder’s nomination shall not be considered in proper form pursuant to this Section 2.2. 

^Without exception, no person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation at an annual meeting of stockholders unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). In addition, a nominee shall not be eligible for election or re-election if a stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee or if the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. 

^^In addition to the foregoing requirements of this Section 2.2, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of state law and of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.2, including, with respect to business a stockholder intends to bring before the annual meeting that involves a proposal that such stockholder requests to be included in the corporation’s proxy statement, the requirements of Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the 1934 Act. Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to affect any right of the corporation to omit a proposal from the corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the 1934 Act. 

^^***Special Meeting***.

^^A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Board of Directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board (as defined below) or by the president and chief executive officer, but such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. For purposes of this Section 2.3, the term “Whole Board” shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships. The Board of Directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board may cancel, postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting at any time, before or after the notice for such meeting has been sent to the stockholders. 

^^The notice of a special meeting shall include the purpose for which the meeting is called. Only such business shall be considered at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Whole Board or by the president and chief executive officer. Nothing contained in this Section 2.3(b) shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board of Directors may be held. 

^^For a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to Section 2.3(a) and (b), nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors shall be made only (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) by any stockholder of the corporation who (A) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.3(c) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting and (B) delivers a timely written notice of the nomination to the secretary of the corporation that includes the information set forth in Section 2.2(c)(ii) above. To be timely, such notice must be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which Public Announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director at a special meeting unless the person is nominated (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by a stockholder in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.3(c). In addition, a nominee shall not be eligible for election or re-election if a stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee or if the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The chairperson of the special meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination or business was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these bylaws, and if the chairperson should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination or business shall be disregarded. 

^^In addition to the foregoing requirements of this Section 2.3, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of state law and of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.3. 

^^***Notice of Stockholders’ Meetings***. All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these Bylaws not less than ten (10) (or, if sent by third-class mail pursuant to Section 2.5 of these Bylaws, thirty (30)) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. The notice shall specify the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted) or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the Board of Directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action). The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the name of any nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, the board intends to present for election. 

^^***Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit of Notice***. Written notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given either (i) personally, (ii) by private courier, (iii) by first- or third-class United States mail, (iv) by other written communication or (v) by other electronic or wireless means. Notices not personally delivered shall be sent charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the stockholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice. Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or by courier or deposited in the mail or sent by other means of written communication or other electronic or wireless means. 

An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders’ meeting, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice. 

^^***Quorum***. The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting in accordance with Section 2.7 of these Bylaws. 

When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question. 

If a quorum is initially present, the stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken is approved by a majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum. 

^^***Adjourned Meeting; Notice***. When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, unless these Bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 

^^***Voting***. The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these Bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements). 

Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder. 

^^***Validation of Meetings; Waiver of Notice; Consent***. The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, who was not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. 

Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting. 

^^***No Stockholder Action By Written Consent***. The stockholders of the corporation may not take action by written consent without a meeting but must take any such actions at a duly called annual or special meeting. 

^^***Record Date For Stockholder Notice; Voting***. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, by these Bylaws, by agreement or by applicable law. 

If the Board of Directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. 

^determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting. 

The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Section 8.1 of these Bylaws. 

^^***Proxies***. Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder’s name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, facsimile or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder’s attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to the irrevocability of proxies). 

^written proxy may be in the form of an electronic transmission as described in Article IX hereof which sets forth or is submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the person. 

^^***Organization***. The president, or in the absence of the president, the chairman of the board, shall call the meeting of the stockholders to order, and shall act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the president, the chairman of the board, and all of the vice presidents, the stockholders shall appoint a chairman for such meeting. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including such matters as the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business. The secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of the stockholders, but in the absence of the secretary at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. 

The Board of Directors of the corporation shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations on participation in such meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation and their duly authorized and constituted proxies, and such other persons as the chairman shall permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants and regulation of the opening and closing of the polls for balloting and matters which are to be voted on by ballot. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with rules of parliamentary procedure. 

^^***List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote***. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the corporation’s principal executive office. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and of the number of shares held by each such stockholder. 

^^***Inspectors of Election***. Before any meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder’s proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy. 

Such inspectors shall: 

^^determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;

^^***Stock Certificates; Transfer; Partly Paid Shares***. The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board of Directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 

Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the Board of Directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; and, if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts. 

Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books. 

The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon. 

^^***Special Designation On Certificates***. If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to transfers of stock, stock certificates and uncertificated stock), in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. 

^^***Lost Certificates***. Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time. The Board of Directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate. 

^^***Transfer Agents and Registrars***. The Board of Directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company, either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the Board of Directors may designate. 

^^***Construction; Definitions***. Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these Bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, as used in these Bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term “person” includes both an entity and a natural person. 

^^***Provisions Additional to Provisions of Law***. All restrictions, limitations, requirements and other provisions of these Bylaws shall be construed, insofar as possible, as supplemental and additional to all provisions of law applicable to the subject matter thereof and shall be fully complied with in addition to the said provisions of law unless such compliance shall be illegal. 

^^***Provisions Contrary to Provisions Of Law***. Any article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of these Bylaws which upon being construed in the manner provided in Section 8.9 hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable provisions of law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law shall remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability of any other portions of these Bylaws, it being hereby declared that these Bylaws would have been adopted and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal. 

^^***Notices***. Any reference in these Bylaws to the time a notice is given or sent means, unless otherwise expressly provided, the time a written notice by mail is deposited in the United States mails, postage prepaid; or the time any other written notice is personally delivered to the recipient or is delivered to a common carrier for transmission, or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by electronic means, to the recipient; or the time any oral notice is communicated, in person or by telephone or wireless means, to the recipient or to a person at the office of the recipient who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the recipient. 

\centered ***NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION*** 

^^***Notice by Electronic Transmission***. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if: 

^^^the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent; and 

^^^such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice. 

However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 

Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given: 

^^^if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; 

^^^if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; 

^^^if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and 

^^^if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. 

An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 

^^***Definition of Electronic Transmission***. An “electronic transmission” means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. 

^^***Inapplicability***. Notice by a form of electronic transmission shall not apply to Section 164 (relating to failure to pay for stock; remedies), Section 296 (relating to adjudication of claims; appeal), Section 311 (relating to revocation of voluntary dissolution), Section 312 (relating to renewal, revival, extension and restoration of certificate of incorporation) or Section 324 (relating to attachment of shares of stock or any option, right or interest therein) of the DGCL. 

\centered ***AMENDMENTS*** 

Subject to Section 6.7 hereof, the original or other Bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat. The corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws upon the Board of Directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the Board of Directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws. 

Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of Bylaws with the original Bylaws in the appropriate place. If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said book.
