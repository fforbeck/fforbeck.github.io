**NOW THEREFORE**, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Section 1. **Employment**. The Company hereby employs Executive, and Executive hereby accepts employment with the Company, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, for the period of thirty-six (36) months beginning on and effective as of [[Date 1]], and ending thirty-six (36) months thereafter, unless Executive’s employment is extended as hereinafter provided or is terminated as provided in Section 4 hereof (the “ **Employment Period** ”). Thereafter, this Agreement shall be deemed extended from year to year upon the same terms and conditions as set out herein, unless either party has notified the other of their intent to terminate this Agreement within at least one hundred twenty (120) days of the end of any then current Employment Period, or unless this Agreement is terminated as provide in paragraph 4 hereof.

Section 2. **Position and Duties**. During the Employment Period, Executive will serve as the Chief Operating Officer of the Company and render such managerial, analytical, administrative and other executive services to the Company and its Affiliates, as are from time to time necessary in connection with the management and affairs of the Company and its Affiliates, in each case subject to the authority of the Board (as defined below) of the Company to define and limit such executive services, including serving as an officer, manager, employee or in any other capacity for any Affiliate of the Company. Executive will devote his best efforts and all of his business time and attention (except for permitted vacation periods and reasonable periods of illness or other incapacity) to the business and affairs of the Company and its Affiliates. Executive will perform his duties and responsibilities to the best of his abilities in a diligent, trustworthy, businesslike and efficient manner.

Section 3. **Salary and Benefits**.  

^^**Salary**. Executive’s compensation consists of a salary and bonus as described below and as specifically outlined on Exhibit A to this Agreement. The Company will pay Executive salary at a rate equal to the amount reflected on Exhibit A (the “Salary”). Said amount may be adjusted from time to time. The Salary will be payable in regular installments in accordance with the general payroll practices of the Company. Executive will also be eligible for an annual salary review by the Company and the Salary may be adjusted by the Company based on the achievement of performance goals.

^^**Bonuses**. During the Employment Period, the Company will establish cash and equity incentive bonus programs representing potential additional incentive compensation for Executive. Specifically, you will be eligible to be considered for a performance based bonus as set forth on Exhibit A of this Agreement. The bonus program shall be administered and distributed under the sole direction of the Compensation Committee of the Board, taking into account the recommendations of senior management of the Company and the achievement of annual goals and objectives as established and approved by the Board. If the Employment Period during any fiscal year is less than the full fiscal year, the bonus amount paid to Executive, if any, attributable to any fiscal year shall be prorated for the actual number of days of the Employment Period that elapse during such fiscal year.

^^**Benefits**. During the Employment Period, the Company will provide Executive with family health, dental and major medical, vision and disability coverage, as well as participation under such plans as the Board may establish or maintain from time to time for executive officers of the Company (collectively, the “ **Benefits** ”). Executive will be entitled to such paid vacation per annum as the Company shall establish as Company policy for all management of the Company.

^^**Reimbursement of Expenses**. During the Employment Period, the Company will reimburse Executive for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by him during the Employment Period in the course of performing his duties under this Agreement which are consistent with the Company’s policies in effect from time to time with respect to travel, entertainment and other business expenses, subject to the Company’s requirements with respect to reporting and documentation of such expenses. Specifically, the Company agrees to pay up to $[[USD Value 1: Number]] towards the Executives’ expenses for moving to Louisville, KY.

Section 4. **Termination**.  

^^The Employment Period will continue until the earlier of:

^^^Executive’s resignation  

^for Good Reason on thirty (30) days’ written notice,

^for any other reason or no reason (a resignation described in this clause (i)(B) being a resignation by the Executive “Without Good Reason”) or

^as a result of Executive’s death or Disability, which resignation shall be deemed automatically tendered upon Executive’s death or Disability; or

^^^the giving of notice of termination by the Company

^for Cause or  
^for any other reason or for no reason (a termination described in this clause (ii)(B)being a termination by the Company “Without Cause”)

For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” means

^^^any willful or intentional act of Executive that has the effect of injuring the reputation or business of the Company or its Affiliates in any material respect,

^^^Executive’s use of illegal drugs,  

^^^that the Executive has materially failed to perform his duties hereunder and such failure continues uncured for 30 days after notice to Executive by the Company; provided, the foregoing notice shall only be required with respect to one material breach that occurs in any 12-month period, or

^^^Executive’s indictment, conviction or a plea of guilty or no contest or similar plea with respect to, a felony, an act of fraud or embezzlement, a breach of fiduciary duty to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or a (v) breach of any of Sections 6, 7 or 8 of this Agreement.

For the purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” means

^^^any substantial diminution in the Executive’s professional responsibilities,

^^^any intentional act which creates a workplace environmental that, by duress or otherwise, makes it impossible for Executive to continue his employment,

^^^a reduction in Salary or the overall level of other compensation and benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement, or

^^^the failure by the Company to pay the Executive any portion of the Executive’s current compensation when due and such failure continues for 7 days after notice to Company from Executive provided that the foregoing notice shall only be required with respect to one such failure in any 12-month period. For avoidance of doubt, Executive hereby acknowledges that the Board may from time to time reorganize the operations of the Company resulting in a change in Executive’s title or direct employer, which change alone shall not constitute Good Reason so long as any change in title or reporting responsibilities results in no substantial diminution in Executive’s responsibilities and any new direct employer agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, without modification other than to reflect the change in title and employer.

^^In the event the Employment Period is terminated by the Company Without Cause or the Executive resigns for Good Reason, then, so long as Executive continues to comply with Sections 6, 7 and 8 hereof, and so long as Executive executes and delivers to the Company immediately prior to the payment of such first installment a release in the form of Exhibit B, then Executive will be entitled to receive an amount (the “**Severance Amount**”) equal to twelve (12) months pay at the rate of Executive’s Salary in effect at the Termination Date and payable in accordance with the Company’s regular payment schedule in effect at the Termination Date. In addition, in connection with termination described in the preceding sentence, Executive shall be entitled to receive

^^^any incentive payments earned and accrued but not yet paid to Executive prior to the Termination Date,

^^^continued medical coverage during the Severance Term pursuant to COBRA at the Company’s expense; and

^^^all accrued and unpaid Salary and unused vacation time through the Termination Date and all unreimbursed business expenses incurred through the Termination Date; provided, as a condition to receiving the Severance Amount or any payment or benefit described in paragraphs 4(b)(i) and 4(b)(ii).

^^In the event the Employment Period is terminated due to the Executive’s death, or resignation Without Good Reason or by the Company with Cause then, so long as Executive continues to comply with Sections 6, 7 and 8 hereof, Executive will be entitled to receive the items described in paragraphs 4(b)(i) and 4(b)(iii) above.

^^In the event the Employment Period is terminated by the Executive or the Company due to the Executive’s Disability, then the Executive shall receive his monthly Salary and benefits through the end of the calendar month in which such termination occurs and, so long as Executive continues to comply with Sections 6, 7 and 8 hereof, Executive will be entitled to receive the items described in Sections 4(b)(i),(ii) and (iii) above.

Section 5. **Resignation as Officer or Director**. Upon the Termination Date, Executive will be deemed to have resigned from each position (if any) that he then holds as an officer or director of the Company and each of its Affiliates, and Executive will take any and all reasonable action that the Company may request in order to confirm or evidence such resignation.

Section 6. **Confidential Information**.  
^^Executive acknowledges that the information, observations and data that may be obtained by Executive during his employment relationship with, or through his involvement as a consultant, contractor, representative, agent, officer, director, partner, member or stockholder of, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates thereof (each of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates being a “ **Related Company** ” and, collectively, the “ **Related Companies** ”), prior to and after the date of this Agreement concerning the business or affairs of the Related Companies (collectively, “ **Confidential Information** ”) are and will be the property of the Related Companies (“Company Property”). Therefore, Executive agrees that he will not disclose to any unauthorized Person or use for the account of himself or any other Person any Company Property or Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Company (by the action of the Board), unless and to the extent that such Company Property or Confidential Information has become generally known to and available for use by the public other than as a result of Executive’s improper acts or omissions to act, or is required to be disclosed by law. Executive will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company at, or within two days of, the Termination Date, or at any other time the Company may request, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) containing or relating to Company Property or Confidential Information or the business of any Related Company which Executive may then possess or have under his control.

^^This Agreement imposes no obligation upon Executive with respect to data or Information that: (a) was in employee’s possession before receipt from Company; or (b) is or becomes available to the public through no fault of Executive. For the purposes of this section, information shall not be deemed to be in the public domain merely because any part of said information is embodied in general disclosures or because individual features, components or combinations thereof are now, or become, known to the public, provided, however, that the obligations of this section hereof shall not apply to any such part of said information; or (c) is received in good faith by Executive from a third party that legally possesses such Information and is not subject to an obligation of confidentiality owed to the third party. In the event that Executive is required by judicial or administrative process to disclose Information, it shall promptly notify the Company and allow the Company a reasonable time to oppose such process.

Section 7. **Non-Compete, Non-Solicitation**.

Therefore, Executive agrees that, during his employment with the Company and for one year after the Termination Date (the “ **Non-Compete Period** ”), unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties to this Agreement, he will not, directly or indirectly, invest in, own, manage, operate, finance, control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation, financing, or control of, be employed by, render services to, or in any manner connected with any business (in each case including on his own behalf or on behalf of another Person), whose products, services or activities Compete with the products, services or activities of the Company or its Affiliates, as they now exist or may exist during such one year period, anywhere within the United States. For purposes of Section 7, an Executive will be deemed to Compete with the Company if he directly or indirectly, invests in, owns, manages, operates, finances, controls, or participates in the ownership, management, operation, financing, or control of, is employed by, renders services to, or in any manner works with any business that receives at least [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of its revenue from the same product class from which the Company receives at least [[Percentage 1]]% of its revenue. However, that Executive may purchase or otherwise acquire up to (but not more than) [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of any class of securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise directly or indirectly participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on any national or regional securities exchange or have been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Executive agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area, and scope. By initialing in the space provided below, Executive acknowledges that he has read carefully and had the opportunity to consult with legal counsel regarding the provisions of this Section 7(a). __**/s/ RA**_ **[initial]** .

^^^induce or attempt to induce any customer, supplier or other business relation of the Company or any Subsidiary, or their respective Affiliates, to cease doing business with such entity or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, supplier or other business relation and such entity.

Section 9. **Enforcement**. The Company and Executive agree that if, at any time a court holds that anything stated in any Section of this Agreement is unreasonable under circumstances then existing, then the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated period, scope or area. Because Executive’s services are unique and because Executive has access to information of the type described in Sections 6, 7 and 8 hereof, the Company and Executive agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any breach of Section 6, 7 or 8 hereof. Therefore, in the event of a breach of Section 6, 7 or 8 hereof, the Company and any Subsidiary thereof may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive relief in order to enforce, or prevent any violations of, the provisions of Section 6, 7 or 8 hereof. The provisions of Sections 6, 7 and 8 hereof are intended to be for the benefit of the Company and any Subsidiary thereof and their respective successors and assigns.
