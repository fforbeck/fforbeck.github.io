^^a material, adverse change in Executive’s authority, responsibilities or duties; provided, that for purposes of this Agreement and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a material, adverse change shall be deemed to occur if Executive no longer serves as Chief Financial Officer (who shall be the most senior financial executive) of a publicly-traded company reporting directly to the CEO; 

^^the relocation of Executive’s work place for Company over Executive’s written objection, to a location more than thirty (30) miles from [[Address 2: Address]]; 

^^a failure to pay, or any material reduction of Executive’s Base Salary or Executive’s Bonus without Executive’s written consent (subject to applicable performance requirements with respect to the actual amount of Bonus earned by Executive); or 

^^^^^ 
^^any material breach of this Agreement by Company that is not cured within thirty (30) days of Company’s receipt of written notice from Executive specifying the material breach of this Agreement. 

^^Voluntary Resignation by Executive. Executive may voluntarily resign Executive’s position with Company for any reason, at any time after the Effective Date, on five (5) days’ advance written notice. In the event of Executive’s resignation, Executive will be entitled to receive only the Base Salary for the five-day notice period and no other amount (other than amounts to which Executive is entitled pursuant to Section 5 or 6 hereof).

In addition, Executive will not be entitled to receive any other Severance Benefits described in Section 7.2, above. The provisions of this Section 7.4 shall not apply to Executive’s resignation for Good Reason. 

^^Forfeiture of Severance Benefits. The right of Executive to receive or to retain Severance Benefits pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 shall be subject to Executive’s continued compliance with the Covenants (as defined in Section 12). In the event that an arbitrator finds in accordance with the procedures described in Section 13 that Executive has engaged in a material breach of any of the Covenants, the Company shall have the right to (a) terminate any further provision of Severance Benefits not yet paid or provided, (b) seek reimbursement from Executive for any and all such Severance Benefits previously paid or provided to Executive, (c) recover from Executive all shares of stock of the Company the vesting of which was accelerated by reason of the Severance Benefits (or the proceeds therefrom, reduced by any exercise or purchase price paid to acquire such shares), and (d) to immediately cancel all Equity Awards the vesting of which was accelerated by reason of the Severance Benefits. 

^^Acceleration of Vesting on a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control (as defined by the applicable award agreements described in Section 4.2 or, absent such definition therein, as defined by the Company’s 2005 Performance Incentive Plan or other employee equity plan approved by the Board), the vesting of all then unvested Inducement Awards and Equity Awards granted to Executive will accelerate immediately prior to, but contingent upon the consummation of, the Change in Control, irrespective of whether, within a period of four (4) months prior to such Change in Control, Executive has been involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause as described in Section 7.2 or has terminated his employment for Good Reason as described in Section 7.3. 

^No Conflict of Interest. During the term of Executive’s employment with Company, Executive must not engage in any work, paid or unpaid, that creates an actual or potential conflict of interest with Company. If the Board reasonably believes such a conflict exists during the term of this Agreement, the Board may ask Executive to choose to discontinue the other work or resign employment with Company. 

^Post-Termination Non-Competition.  

^^Consideration For Promise To Refrain From Competing. Executive agrees that Executive’s services are special and unique, that Company’s disclosure of confidential, proprietary information and specialized training and knowledge to Executive, and that Executive’s level of compensation and benefits are partly in consideration of and conditioned upon Executive not competing with Company. Executive acknowledges that such consideration is adequate for Executive’s promises contained within this Section 9. 

^^^^^ 
^^Promise To Refrain From Competing. Executive understands Company’s need for Executive’s promise not to compete with Company is based on the following: (a) Company has expended, and will continue to expend, substantial time, money and effort in developing its proprietary information; (b) Executive will in the course of Executive’s employment develop, be personally entrusted with and exposed to Company’s proprietary information; (c) both during and after the term of Executive’s employment, Company will be engaged in the highly competitive retail demand chain software industry; (d) Company provides products and services nationally and internationally; and (e) Company will suffer great loss and irreparable harm if Executive were to enter into competition with Company. Therefore, in exchange for the consideration described in Section 9.1 above, Executive agrees that for the period of nine (9) months following the date Executive ceases to render services to Company (the “***Covenant Period***”), Executive will not either directly or indirectly, whether as an owner, director, officer, manager, consultant, agent or employee: (i) work for a competitor of Company, which is defined to include those entities or persons in the business of developing, marketing, selling and supporting software designed for businesses in the retail and consumer packaged goods markets or in the business of helping companies synchronize their inventory decisions with advanced supply chain, inventory management and data mining solutions, in any country in which Company does business (the “***Restricted Business***”) or (ii) make or hold during the Covenant Period any investment in any Restricted Business, whether such investment be by way of loan, purchase of stock or otherwise, provided that there shall be excluded from the foregoing the ownership of not more than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the listed or traded stock of any publicly held corporation. For purposes of this Section 9, the term “***Company***” shall mean and include Company, any subsidiary or affiliate of Company, any successor to the business of Company (by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or stock or otherwise) and any other corporation or entity of which Executive may serve as a director, officer or employee at the request of Company or any successor of Company. 

^^Reasonableness of Restrictions. Executive represents and agrees that the restrictions on competition, as to time, geographic area, and scope of activity, required by this Section 9 are reasonable, do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and business interests of Company, and are not unduly burdensome to Executive. Executive expressly acknowledges that Company competes on an international basis and that the geographical scope of these limitations is reasonable and necessary for the protection of Company’s trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information. Executive further agrees that these restrictions allow Executive an adequate number and variety of employment alternatives, based on Executive’s varied skills and abilities. Executive represents that Executive is willing and able to compete in other employment not prohibited by this Agreement. 

^^Reformation if Necessary. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the geographic area, duration, or scope of activity of any restriction under this Section 9 and its subsections is unenforceable, the restrictions under this section and its subsections shall not be terminated but shall be reformed and modified to the extent required to render them valid and enforceable. Executive further agrees that the court may reform this Agreement to extend the Covenant Period by an amount of time equal to any period in which Executive is in breach of this covenant. 

^Confidentiality and Proprietary Rights. Executive agrees to read, sign and abide by Company’s Employee Innovations and Proprietary Rights Assignment Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C and incorporated herein by reference. 

^Nonsolicitation.  

^^Nonsolicitation of Customers or Prospects. Executive acknowledges that information about Company’s customers is confidential and constitutes trade secrets. Accordingly, Executive agrees that during the term of this Agreement and the Covenant Period, Executive will not, 

^^^^^ 
either directly or indirectly, separately or in association with others, interfere with, impair, disrupt or damage Company’s relationship with any of its customers or customer prospects (defined as prospective customers who had received a written proposal from the Company for Company products or services within the past 12 months) by soliciting or encouraging others to solicit any of them for the purpose of diverting or taking away business from Company. 

^^Nonsolicitation of Company’s Employees. Executive agrees that during the term of this Agreement and the Covenant Period, Executive will not, either directly or indirectly, separately or in association with others, interfere with, impair, disrupt or damage Company’s business by soliciting, encouraging, hiring or attempting to hire any of Company’s employees or causing others to solicit or encourage any of Company’s employees to discontinue their employment with Company. 

^Injunctive Relief. Executive acknowledges that Executive’s breach of the covenants contained in Sections 9-11 (collectively “***Covenants***”) would cause irreparable injury to Company and agrees that in the event of any such breach, Company shall, in addition to the action it is authorized to take pursuant to Section 7.5, be entitled to seek temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond or other security. 

^Agreement to Mediate and Arbitrate. In the event a dispute arises in connection with this Agreement, the Company and Executive agree to submit the dispute to non-binding mediation, with the mediator to be selected and compensated by the Company. In the event a resolution is not reached through mediation, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Executive and Company agree to arbitrate any controversy, claim or dispute between them arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement, the employment relationship between Company and Executive and any disputes upon termination of employment, including but not limited to breach of contract, tort, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, demotion, discipline, failure to accommodate, family and medical leave, compensation or benefits claims, constitutional claims; and any claims for violation of any local, state or federal law, statute, regulation or ordinance or common law. Claims for breach of Company’s Employee Innovations and Proprietary Rights Agreement, workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance benefits and Company’s right to obtain injunctive relief pursuant to Section 12 above are excluded. For the purpose of this agreement to arbitrate, references to “Company” include all parent, subsidiary or related entities and their employees, supervisors, officers, directors, agents, pension or benefit plans, pension or benefit plan sponsors, fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates and all successors and assigns of any of them, and this Agreement shall apply to them to the extent Executive’s claims arise out of or relate to their actions on behalf of Company. 

^^Initiation of Arbitration. Either party may exercise the right to arbitrate by providing the other party with written notice of any and all claims forming the basis of such right in sufficient detail to inform the other party of the substance of such claims. In no event shall the request for arbitration be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claims would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 

^^Arbitration Procedure. The arbitration will be conducted in Maricopa County, Arizona, by a single neutral arbitrator and in accordance with the then current rules for resolution of employment disputes of the American Arbitration Association *(*“***AAA***”)*.* The parties are entitled to representation by an attorney or other representative of their choosing. The arbitrator shall have the power to enter any award that could be entered by a judge of the trial court of the State of Arizona, and only such power, and shall follow the law. The parties agree to abide by and perform any award rendered by the arbitrator. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

If a deemed modification is not satisfactory in the judgment of such arbitrator or court, the unenforceable provision shall be deemed deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby.

Any officer of the Company shall have the authority to act on behalf of the Company with respect to any matter, right, obligation, 

^^^^^ 
or election which is the responsibility of or which is allocated to the Company herein, provided the officer has apparent authority with respect to such matter, right, obligation, or election. 

^**The Award****.**  

^^**Grant of Restricted Stock Units.** On the Date of Grant, the Participant shall acquire, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Number of Restricted Stock Units set forth in the Grant Notice, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.3 and Section 9. Each Unit represents a right to receive on a date determined in accordance with the Grant Notice and this Agreement one (1) share of Stock. 

^^**No Monetary Payment Required.** The Participant is not required to make any monetary payment (other than applicable tax withholding, if any) as a condition to receiving the Units or shares of Stock issued upon settlement of the Units, the consideration for which shall be past services actually rendered and/or future services to be rendered to a Participating Company or for its benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if required by applicable state corporate law, the Participant shall furnish consideration in the form of cash or past services rendered to a Participating Company or for its benefit having a value not less than the par value of the shares of Stock issued upon settlement of the Units. 

^^**Dividend Equivalent Units.** On the date that the Company pays a cash dividend to holders of Stock generally, the Participant shall be credited with a number of additional whole Dividend Equivalent Units determined by dividing (a) the product of (i) the dollar amount of the cash dividend paid per share of Stock on such date and (ii) the total number of Restricted Stock Units and Dividend Equivalent Units previously credited to the Participant pursuant to the Award and which have not been settled or forfeited pursuant to the Company Reacquisition Right (as defined below) as of such date, by (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date. Any resulting fractional Dividend Equivalent Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. Such additional Dividend Equivalent Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled or forfeited in the same manner and at the same time as the Restricted Stock Units originally subject to the Award with respect to which they have been credited. 

^**Vesting of Units**.  

^^**Normal Vesting.** Except as provided in Section 4.2, the Restricted Stock Units shall vest and become Vested Units as provided in the Grant Notice. Dividend Equivalent Units shall become Vested Units at the same time as the Restricted Stock Units originally subject to the Award with respect to which they have been credited. 

^^**Acceleration of Vesting Upon a Change in Control**. In the event of a Change in Control, and provided that the Participant’s Service has not terminated prior to the date of consummation of the Change in Control, all unvested Units shall become Vested Units and shall be settled in accordance with Section 6 immediately prior to (and contingent upon) the consummation of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the Grant Notice to the contrary, for purposes of the acceleration of vesting of the Units provided by this Section, termination of the Participant’s employment with the Company within a period 

^^^^^ 
of four (4) months prior to the consummation of the Change in Control either as a result of involuntary termination by the Company without Cause, as described in Section 7.2 of the Employment Agreement, or as a result of termination by the Participant for Good Reason, as described in Section 7.3 of the Employment Agreement, shall not be treated as termination of the Participant’s Service prior to the consummation of the Change in Control. 

^^**Federal Excise Tax Under Section 4999 of the Code.** 

^^**Excess Parachute Payment.** In the event that any acceleration of vesting pursuant to this Agreement and any other payment or benefit received or to be received by the Participant would subject the Participant to any excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code due to the characterization of such acceleration of vesting, payment or benefit as an excess parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, the Participant may elect, in his or her sole discretion, to reduce the amount of any acceleration of vesting called for under this Agreement in order to avoid such characterization. 

^^**Determination by Independent Accountants.** To aid the Participant in making any election called for under Section 4.3(a), in connection with any event that might reasonably be anticipated to give rise to the acceleration of vesting under Section 4.3(a), the Company shall promptly request a determination in writing by independent public accountants selected by the Company (the ***Accountants***). Unless the Company and the Participant otherwise agree in writing, the Accountants shall determine and report to the Company and the Participant the amount of such acceleration of vesting, payments and benefits which would produce the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant. For the purposes of such determination, the Accountants may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Participant shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make their required determination. The Company shall bear all fees and expenses the Accountants may reasonably charge in connection with their services contemplated by this section. 

^**Company Reacquisition Right****.**  

^^**Grant of Company Reacquisition Right***.*** In the event that the Participant’s Service terminates for any reason or no reason, with or without cause, the Participant shall forfeit and the Company shall automatically reacquire all Units which are not, as of the time of such termination, Vested Units, and the Participant shall not be entitled to any payment therefor (the *Company Reacquisition Right***), subject to the provisions of any employment, service or other agreement between the Participant and a Participating Company referring to this Award. 

^^**Ownership Change Event*****.*** For purposes of determining the number of Vested Units following an Ownership Change Event, credited Service shall include all Service with any corporation which is a Participating Company at the time the Service is rendered, whether or not such corporation is a Participating Company both before and after the Ownership Change Event. 

^^^^^ 
^**Settlement of the Award****.**  

^^**Issuance of Shares of Stock***.*** Subject to the provisions of Section 6.3 below, the Company shall issue to the Participant, on the Settlement Date with respect to each Unit to be settled on such date, one (1) share of Stock; provided however, that if such Settlement Date is a date on which a sale by the Participant of the Stock to be issued in settlement of such Unit would violate the Insider Trading Policy of the Company, then the Settlement Date with respect to such Unit shall be the earlier of (a) the next day on which such sale would not violate the Insider Trading Policy or (b) the date that is two and one-half (2/) months following the last day of the calendar year in which such Unit became a Vested Unit. For purposes of this section, *Insider Trading Policy***means the written policy of the Company pertaining to the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Company’s equity securities by members of the Board, officers or other employees who may possess material, non-public information regarding the Company, as in effect at the time of a disposition of any shares of Stock. Shares of Stock issued in settlement of Units shall not be subject to any restriction on transfer other than any such restriction as may be required pursuant to Section 6.3. 

^^**Beneficial Ownership of Shares; Certificate Registration*****.*** The Participant hereby authorizes the Company, in its sole discretion, to deposit for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship of which the Company has notice any or all shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to the settlement of the Award. Except as provided by the preceding sentence, a certificate for the shares as to which the Award is settled shall be registered in the name of the Participant, or, if applicable, in the names of the heirs of the Participant. 

^^**Restrictions on Grant of the Award and Issuance of Shares*****.*** The grant of the Award and issuance of shares of Stock upon settlement of the Award shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities. No shares of Stock may be issued hereunder if the issuance of such shares would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any shares subject to the Award shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the settlement of the Award, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company. 

^^**Fractional Shares*****.*** The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares upon the settlement of the Award. 

^**Tax Withholding****.**  

^^**In General.** At the time the Grant Notice is executed, or at any time thereafter as requested by a Participating Company, the Participant hereby authorizes 

^^^^^ 
withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for, any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company, if any, which arise in connection with the Award or the issuance of shares of Stock in settlement thereof. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock until the tax withholding obligations of the Company have been satisfied by the Participant. 

^^**Withholding in Shares.** Unless otherwise determined by the Company, the Company shall satisfy the tax withholding obligations (except with respect to any fractional share) of the Company or any other Participating Company by deducting from the shares of Stock otherwise deliverable to the Participant in settlement of the Award a number of whole shares of Stock having a fair market value, as determined by the Company as of the date on which the tax withholding obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such tax withholding obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates. The Company is authorized to satisfy the tax withholding obligations, if any, remaining following the procedure described in this Section 7.2 by withholding from payroll or any other amounts payable to the Participant. 

^**Effect of Change in Control on Award*****.*** 

In the event of a Change in Control, the vesting and settlement of the Award shall be accelerated as provided by Section 4.2. 

^**Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure****.** 

Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, in the event of any change in the Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of payment of a dividend or distribution to the stockholders of the Company in a form other than Stock (excepting normal cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made in the number of Units subject to the Award and/or the number and kind of shares to be issued in settlement of the Award, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the Participant’s rights under the Award. For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as “effected without receipt of consideration by the Company.” Any fractional Unit or share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this section shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Such adjustments shall be determined by the Committee, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 

^**Rights as a Stockholder, Director, Employee or Consultant****.** 

The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares which may be issued in settlement of this Award until the date of the issuance of a certificate for such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, 

^^^^^ 
distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 3.3 and Section 9. If the Participant is an employee, the Participant understands and acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in a separate, written employment agreement between a Participating Company and the Participant, the Participant’s employment is “at will” and is for no specified term. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the Service of a Participating Company or interfere in any way with any right of the Participating Company Group to terminate the Participant’s Service at any time. 

^**Legends****.**  

The Company may at any time place legends referencing any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law restrictions on all certificates representing shares of stock issued pursuant to this Agreement. The Participant shall, at the request of the Company, promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares acquired pursuant to this Award in the possession of the Participant in order to carry out the provisions of this section. 

^**Compliance with Section 409A****.**  

It is intended that any election, payment or benefit which is made or provided pursuant to or in connection with this Award that may result in a deferral of compensation as described in Section 409A of the Code (***Section 409A Deferred Compensation***) shall comply in all respects with the applicable requirements of Section 409A (including applicable regulations or other administrative guidance thereunder, as determined by the Committee in good faith) to avoid the unfavorable tax consequences provided therein for non-compliance. In connection with effecting such compliance with Section 409A, the following shall apply: 

^^**Required Delay in** Payment **to Specified Employee.** If the Participant is a “specified employee” of a publicly traded corporation as defined under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, unless subject to an applicable exception under Section 409A, any payment of Section 409A Deferred Compensation in connection with a “separation from service” (as determined for purposes of Section 409A) shall not be made until six (6) months after the Participant’s separation from service (the “**Section 409A Deferral Period**”). In the event such payments are otherwise due to be made in installments or periodically during the Section 409A Deferral Period, the payments of Section 409A Deferred Compensation which would otherwise have been made in the Section 409A Deferral Period shall be accumulated and paid in a lump sum as soon as the Section 409A Deferral Period ends, and the balance of the payments shall be made as otherwise scheduled. 

^^**Other Delays in Payment.** Neither the Participant nor the Company shall take any action to accelerate or delay the payment of any benefits under this Agreement in any manner which would not be in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. 

^^**Amendments to Comply with Section 409A; Indemnification.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company is authorized to amend this Agreement, to void or amend any election made by the Participant under this Agreement and/or to delay the payment of any monies and/or provision of any 

^^^^^ 
benefits in such manner as may be determined by the Company, in its discretion, to be necessary or appropriate to comply with Section 409A of the Code without prior notice to or consent of the Participant. The Participant hereby releases and holds harmless the Company, its directors, officers and stockholders from any and all claims that may arise from or relate to any tax liability, penalties, interest, costs, fees or other liability incurred by the Participant in connection with the Award, including as a result of the application of Section 409A of the Code. 

^**Miscellaneous Provisions****.**  

^^**Termination or Amendment.** The Committee may terminate or amend this Agreement at any time; provided, however, that no such termination or amendment may adversely affect the Participant’s rights under this Agreement without the consent of the Participant unless such termination or amendment is necessary to comply with applicable law or government regulation or as provided in Section 12.3. No amendment or addition to this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing. 

^^**Nontransferability of the Award.** Prior to the issuance of shares of Stock on the applicable Settlement Date, neither this Award nor any Units subject to this Award shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to the Award shall be exercisable during the Participant’s lifetime only by the Participant or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative. 

^^**Further Instruments.** The parties hereto agree to execute such further instruments and to take such further action as may reasonably be necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement. 

^^**Binding Effect.** This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company and, subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth herein, be binding upon the Participant and the Participant’s heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.

Such means of electronic delivery may include but do not necessarily include the delivery of a link to a Company intranet or the Internet site of a third party involved in administering the Award, the delivery of the document via e-mail or such other means of electronic delivery specified by the Company.

[[Company]] (the ***Company***) has granted to [[Executive]] (the ***Participant***) an award of Restricted Stock Units (the ***Award***), each of which represents the right to receive on the applicable Settlement Date one (1) share of the Common Stock of the Company, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Notice of Grant of Restricted Stock Units (the ***Grant Notice***) and the Restricted Stock Units Agreement attached hereto (the ***Agreement***). 

\centered 

**Date of Grant:**    [[Date 1]] 

**Number of Restricted Stock Units:**    50,000, subject to adjustment as provided by the Agreement. 

**Settlement Date:**    For each Unit, except as otherwise provided by the Agreement, as soon as practicable following the date on which such Unit becomes a Vested Unit in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth below, provided that in no event shall the Settlement Date with respect to any Vested Unit be later than the 15th day of the third month following the later of (i) the last day of the calendar year in which such Unit becomes a Vested Unit or (ii) the last day of the Company fiscal year in which such Unit becomes a Vested Unit. 

**Vested Units:** Except as provided by the Agreement and provided that the Participant’s Service has not terminated prior to the relevant date except as otherwise provided by the Pro Rata Vesting provision below, the number of Vested Units (disregarding any resulting fractional Unit) as of any date is determined by multiplying the Number of Restricted Stock Units by the ***Vested Ratio***determined as of such date as follows:

EBITDA, as it deems appropriate, to exclude the effect (whether positive or negative) of any of the following occurring after the grant of the Award: (a) a change in accounting standards required by generally accepted accounting principles or (b) any extraordinary, unusual or nonrecurring item. Each such adjustment, if any, shall be made solely for the purpose of providing a consistent basis from period to period for the calculation of EBITDA in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the Participant’s rights with respect to the Award. 

**Pro Rata Vesting:**    In the event that the Participant becomes entitled to “Severance Benefits” in accordance with either Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 of the Employment Agreement, then a number of Restricted Stock Units shall become Vested Units, effective on the forty-fifth day following the date of the Participant’s termination of employment, in an amount equal to: 

^^,000 x ((X  $[***]) / $[***]))  Y, where 

“X” is equal to EBITDA achieved during the four consecutive fiscal quarter period of the Company beginning on or after the Date of Grant and ending prior to the Participant’s employment termination date which has the greatest EBITDA; and 

“Y” is equal to the number of Vested Units previously determined without regard to this provision.

^^^^^ 
Shares as to which the Award is settled shall be registered in the name of the Participant, or, if applicable, in the names of the heirs of the Participant. 

^^**Restrictions on Grant of the Award and Issuance of Common Shares*****.*** The grant of the Award and issuance of Common Shares upon settlement of the Award shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state law or foreign law with respect to such securities. No Common Shares may be issued hereunder if the issuance of such shares would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any Common Shares subject to the Award shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

^^**Fractional Shares*****.*** The Company shall not be required to issue fractional Common Shares upon the settlement of the Award. Any fractional share resulting from the determination of the number of Vested Performance Shares shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. 

^**Tax Withholding****.**  

^^**In General.** At the time the Grant Notice is executed, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Participant hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for, any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Company, if any, which arise in connection with the Award or the issuance of Common Shares in settlement thereof. The Company shall have no obligation to process the settlement of the Award or to deliver Common Shares until the tax withholding obligations as described in this Section have been satisfied by the Participant. 

^^**Withholding in Common Shares.** Unless otherwise determined by the Company, the Company shall satisfy the tax withholding obligations (except with respect to any fractional share) of the Company or any other Participating Company by deducting from the Common Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant in settlement of the Award a number of whole Common Shares having a fair market value, as determined by the Company as of the date on which the tax withholding obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such tax withholding obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates. The Company is authorized to satisfy the tax withholding obligations, if any, remaining following the procedure described in this Section 7.2 by withholding from payroll or any other amounts payable to the Participant. 

^^^^^ 
^**CHANGE IN CONTROL*****.***  

^^**Effect of Change in Control on Performance Shares.** In the event of a Change in Control prior to the Initial Vesting Date and provided that the Participant’s Service has not terminated prior to the consummation of the Change in Control (except as otherwise provided below), [[Percentage 2]]% of the Target Number of Performance Shares shall become Vested Performance Shares and shall be settled in accordance with Section 6 immediately prior to (and contingent upon) the consummation of the Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control on or after the Initial Vesting Date and provided that the Participant’s Service has not terminated prior to the consummation of the Change in Control (except as otherwise provided below), then, in addition to the number of Performance Shares which became Vested Performance Shares on the Initial Vesting Date, as provided in the Grant Notice and as determined by the Committee, [[Percentage 2]]% of the Performance Shares subject to time based vesting, as provided in the Grant Notice and as determined by the Committee, shall become Vested Performance Shares and shall be settled in accordance with Section 6 immediately prior to (and contingent upon) the consummation of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the Grant Notice to the contrary, for purposes of the acceleration of vesting of the Performance Shares provided by this Section, termination of the Participant’s employment with the Company within a period of four (4) months prior to the consummation of the Change in Control either as a result of involuntary termination by the Company without Cause, as described in Section 7.2 of the Employment Agreement, or as a result of termination by the Participant for Good Reason, as described in Section 7.3 of the Employment Agreement, shall not be treated as termination of the Participant’s Service prior to the consummation of the Change in Control. 

^^**Federal Excise Tax Under Section 4999 of the Code.** 

^^**Excess Parachute Payment.** In the event that any acceleration of vesting the Performance Shares and any other payment or benefit received or to be received by the Participant would subject the Participant to any excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code due to the characterization of such acceleration of vesting, payment or benefit as an “excess parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Code, the Participant may elect, in his or her sole discretion, to reduce the amount of any acceleration of vesting called for by this Agreement in order to avoid such characterization. 

^^**Determination by Independent Accountants.** To aid the Participant in making any election called for under Section 8.2(a), in connection with any event that might reasonably be anticipated to give rise to the acceleration of vesting under Section 8.1, the Company shall promptly request a determination in writing by independent public accountants selected by the Company (the ***Accountants***). Unless the Company and the Participant otherwise agree in writing, the Accountants shall determine and report to the Company and the Participant the amount of such acceleration of vesting, payments and benefits which would produce the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant. For the purposes of such determination, the Accountants may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Participant shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make their required determination. The Company shall bear all fees and expenses the 

^^^^^ 
Accountants may reasonably charge in connection with their services contemplated by this Section 8.2(b). 

^**Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure****.** 

Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, in the event of any change in the Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of payment of a dividend or distribution to the stockholders of the Company in a form other than Stock (excepting normal cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the number of Performance Shares and/or the number and kind of shares to be issued in settlement of the Award, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the Participant’s rights under the Award. For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as “effected without receipt of consideration by the Company.” Any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Such adjustments shall be determined by the Plan Administrator, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 

^**Rights as a Stockholder or Employee****.** 

The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Common Shares which may be issued in settlement of this Award until the date of the issuance of a certificate for such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such certificate is issued, except as provided in Sections 3.3 and 9. If the Participant is an employee, the Participant understands and acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in a separate, written employment agreement between a Participating Company and the Participant, the Participant’s employment is “at will” and is for no specified term. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in Service interfere in any way with any right of any Participating Company to terminate the Participant’s Service at any time. 

^**Legends****.**  

The Company may at any time place legends referencing any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law restrictions on all certificates representing Common Shares issued pursuant to this Agreement. The Participant shall, at the request of the Company, promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares acquired pursuant to this Award in the possession of the Participant in order to carry out the provisions of this Section. 

^**Compliance with Section 409A****.**  

It is intended that any election, payment or benefit which is made or provided pursuant to or in connection with this Award that may result in Section 409A Deferred Compensation shall comply in all respects with the applicable requirements of Section 409A 

^^^^^ 
(including applicable regulations or other administrative guidance thereunder, as determined by the Committee in good faith) to avoid the unfavorable tax consequences provided therein for non-compliance. In connection with effecting such compliance with Section 409A, the following shall apply: 

^^**Required Delay in** Payment **to Specified Employee.** If the Participant is a “specified employee” of a publicly traded corporation as defined under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, unless subject to an applicable exception under Section 409A, any payment of Section 409A Deferred Compensation in connection with a “separation from service” (as determined for purposes of Section 409A) shall not be made until six (6) months after the Participant’s separation from service (the “**Section 409A Deferral Period**”). In the event such payments are otherwise due to be made in installments or periodically during the Section 409A Deferral Period, the payments of Section 409A Deferred Compensation which would otherwise have been made in the Section 409A Deferral Period shall be accumulated and paid in a lump sum as soon as the Section 409A Deferral Period ends, and the balance of the payments shall be made as otherwise scheduled. 

^^**Other Delays in Payment.** Neither the Participant nor the Company shall take any action to accelerate or delay the payment of any benefits under this Agreement in any manner which would not be in compliance with Code Section 409A. 

^^**Amendments to Comply with Section 409A; Indemnification.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company is authorized to amend this Agreement, to void or amend any election made by the Participant under this Agreement and/or to delay the payment of any monies and/or provision of any benefits in such manner as may be determined by the Company, in its discretion, to be necessary or appropriate to comply with Section 409A without prior notice to or consent of the Participant. The Participant hereby releases and holds harmless the Company, its directors, officers and stockholders from any and all claims that may arise from or relate to any tax liability, penalties, interest, costs, fees or other liability incurred by the Participant in connection with the Award, including as a result of the application of Section 409A. 

^**Miscellaneous Provisions****.**  

^^**Termination or Amendment.** The Committee may terminate or amend this Agreement at any time; provided, however, that no such termination or amendment may adversely affect the Participant’s rights under this Agreement without the consent of the Participant unless such termination or amendment is necessary to comply with applicable law or government regulation or as provided in Section 12.3. No amendment or addition to this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing. 

^^**Nontransferability of the Award.** Prior the issuance of Common Shares on the Settlement Date, neither this Award nor any Performance Shares subject to this Award shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with 

^^^^^ 
respect to the Award shall be exercisable during the Participant’s lifetime only by the Participant or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative.

Confidentiality Agreement  
[[Date 7: Date]]  
Mr. [[Executive]]

[[Address 5: Address]] 

Dear Pete:  
This letter agreement (“Agreement”) sets forth and confirms certain understandings between you and [[Company]], a Delaware corporation and its current and future affiliates (collectively, “JDA”), and third parties who have provided confidential information to JDA (“Third-Party Beneficiaries”) with respect to your employment with JDA Software, Inc. and your responsibilities and obligations to JDA. Your signature of this Agreement is a condition of your employment with JDA. 

JDA’s disclosure of confidential information to you is conditioned upon and in consideration for your entering into this Agreement. This Agreement is intended to protect important interests of JDA and the Third-Party Beneficiaries, particularly their interests in valuable technology, customers, personnel, business interests and confidential information that JDA has acquired or obtained access to over the years. 

During your employment, you will obtain access to information regarding the business of JDA and which is confidential to JDA or Third-Party Beneficiaries (“Confidential Information”). “Confidential Information” includes but is not limited to: 

^Application, data base, and other computer software developed or acquired by JDA, whether now or existing in the future, and all modifications, enhancements and versions of the software and all options available with respect to the software, and all future products developed or derived from the software;

^Source and object codes, flowcharts, algorithms, coding sheets, routines, sub-routines, design concepts and related documentation and manuals;

^Marketing techniques and arrangements, mailing lists, purchasing information, pricing policies, quoting procedures, financial information, customer and prospect names and requirements, employee, customer, supplier and distributor data and other materials and information relating to JDA’s business and activities and the manner in which JDA does business;

^Discoveries, concepts and ideas including, without limitation, the nature and results of research and development activities, processes, formulas, inventions, computer-related equipment or technology, techniques, “know-how”, designs, drawings and specifications;

^Organizational charts, internal telephone lists and employee directories, salary information, benefits, and other personnel information that is not publicly available;

^Any other materials or information related to the business or activities of JDA that are not generally known to others engaged in similar businesses or activities;

^All ideas which are derived from or relate to your access to or knowledge of any of the above enumerated materials and information; and

Confidentiality Agreement  
^Any materials or information related to the business or activities of the Third-Party Beneficiaries that are received by JDA in confidence or subject to nondisclosure or similar covenants, including without limitation, confidential proprietary business records, financial information, trade secrets, strategies, methods and practices of licensees of JDA software.

Confidential Information does not include inventions or other confidential information, if any, listed on Exhibit A of this Agreement. 

Maintaining the confidentiality of the Confidential Information is of utmost importance to JDA. Accordingly, you agree that, except in the performance of your duties as an employee of JDA, from and after the date of this Agreement (including after the termination of your relationship with JDA, for whatever reason), you will not disclose to any person, association, firm, corporation or other entity in any manner, directly or indirectly, any of the Confidential Information (in whatever form), received, acquired, or developed by you through your association with JDA, or use, or permit any person, association, corporation or other entity to use, in any manner, directly or indirectly, any such Confidential Information. 

You acknowledge that any computer programs, documentation or other copyrightable works created in whole or in part by you during your employment with JDA are “works made for hire” under the United States Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101, and become part of the Confidential Information. 

Confidential Information that you make, conceive, discover or develop, whether alone or jointly with others, at any time during your employment with JDA, whether at the request or upon the suggestion of JDA or otherwise, are the sole and exclusive property of JDA if such items relate to or are useful in connection with any business now or hereafter carried on or contemplated by JDA, including developments or expansions of JDA’s present field of operations. You must promptly disclose to JDA all Confidential Information made, conceived, discovered, or developed in whole or in part by you for JDA during your employment with JDA and to assign to JDA any right, title or interest you may have in such Confidential Information. You agree to execute any instruments and to do all other things reasonably requested by JDA (both during and after your employment with JDA) in order to vest more fully in JDA all ownership rights in those items hereby transferred by you to JDA. If any one or more of such items are protectible by copyright, and are deemed in any way to fall within the definition of “work made for hire”, as that term is defined in 17 U.S.C. § 101, such works shall be considered “works made for hire”, the copyright of which shall be owned solely, completely and exclusively by JDA. If any one or more of the items are protectible by copyright and are not considered to be included in the categories of works covered by the “work made for hire” definition contained in 17 U.S.C. § 101, such works shall be deemed to be assigned and transferred completely and exclusively to JDA by virtue of your execution of this letter. 

You agree to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information during your employment and perpetually after the date of your termination. This Agreement shall be binding upon you and JDA, and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of JDA and the Third-Party Beneficiaries. JDA’s failure to require performance of your obligations under this Agreement does not affect the right of JDA to enforce any provisions of this Agreement at a subsequent time, and does not constitute a waiver of any rights arising out of any subsequent or prior breach. 

Upon voluntary or involuntary termination of your employment with JDA, you agree to sign an acknowledgement that the obligations set forth herein pertaining to Confidential Information shall continue beyond the last day of your employment at JDA. This Agreement (a) may not be modified orally, but only by written agreement signed by you and JDA’s President; (b) contains the entire understanding between you and JDA with respect to this subject matter, and (c) supersedes any prior agreements on this subject. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement.

You must not use or disclose your own or any other party’s confidential or proprietary documents, materials, or information to JDA or any third party in the course of performing your duties as an employee of JDA, unless the owner of the information has authorized the use or disclosure.
