For purposes of the Agreement, “Cause” shall mean:

^^^the material breach of any provision of the Agreement by Employee which has not been cured within five business (5) days after the Company provides notice of the breach to Employee; provided, however, if the act or omission that is the subject of such notice is substantially similar to an act or omission with respect to which Employee has previously received notice and an opportunity to cure, then no additional notice is required and the Agreement may be terminated immediately upon the Company’s election and written notice to Employee);

^^^the entry of a plea of guilty or judgment entered after trial finding Employee guilty of a crime punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year involving moral turpitude (meaning a crime that includes the commission of an act of gross dishonesty or bad morals);

^^Termination By Company Without Cause. The Company, by a vote of a majority of the Board of Directors, may terminate the Agreement at any time, and for any reason, by providing at least 30 days written notice to Employee.

^^^Any change in the duties or responsibilities (including reporting responsibilities) of Employee that is inconsistent in any adverse respect with Employee’s position(s), duties, responsibilities or status with the Company immediately prior to such change (including any diminution of such duties or responsibilities) or (B) an adverse change in Employee’s titles or offices (including, membership on the Board of Directors) with the Company;
