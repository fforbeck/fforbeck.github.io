If the Participant shall fail to enter into any such agreement at the request of the Board and within any period specified by the Board, then the Award granted or to be granted to such Participant shall be forfeited and cancelled. 

^Shares of Common Stock Subject to Plan. 

^^Total Number of Shares. 

^^The total number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan shall be [[Shares 2: Number]]. The number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by (i) one share for each share issued pursuant to a Stock Option or SAR, and (ii) two and one-half shares for each share issued pursuant to a Stock Award or a Stock Unit. Shares issued under the Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares, and shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 of the Plan. 

^^The number of shares of Common Stock delivered by a Participant or withheld by the Company on behalf of any such Participant as full or partial payment of an Award, including the exercise price of a Stock Option or of any required withholding taxes, shall not again be available for issuance pursuant to subsequent Awards, and shall count towards the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan. If there is a lapse, forfeiture, expiration, termination or cancellation of any Award for any reason (including for reasons described in Section 4.3), or if shares of Common Stock are issued under such Award and thereafter are reacquired by the Company pursuant to rights reserved by the Company upon issuance thereof, the shares of Common Stock subject to such Award or reacquired by the Company shall again be available for issuance pursuant to subsequent Awards, and shall not count towards the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan (if any such shares were subject to Stock Options or SARs, the number of shares again available for issuance shall increase by one for each such share, and if any such shares were subject to Stock Awards or Stock Units, the number of shares again available for issuance shall increase by two and one-half for each such share). 

[[Shares 1: Number]] Shares Under Awards. 

Of the 21,000,000 shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan pursuant to Section 5.1: 

^^The maximum number of shares of Common Stock as to which a Key Employee may receive Stock Options in any calendar year is 2,000,000, except that in the case of a Key Employee who is granted Stock Options in connection with his or her commencement of employment with the Company or a Subsidiary, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as to which such Key Employee may receive Stock Options in the calendar year in which his or her commencement of employment occurs is 3,000,000. 

^^The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be used for Awards other than Stock Options that are intended to qualify as “performance based” in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code that may be granted to any Key Employee in any calendar year is 1,000,000, or, in the event the Award is settled in cash, an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such number of shares on the date on which the Award is settled. 

^^The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to Incentive Stock Options is 21,000,000. 

The numbers of shares described herein shall be as adjusted in accordance with Section 5.3 of the Plan. 

^^Adjustment. 

In the event of any reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, stock distribution, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, subdivision, consolidation or exchange of shares, any change in the capital structure of the Company or any similar corporate transaction, the Board shall make such adjustments as are necessary and appropriate to preserve the benefits or intended benefits of the Plan and Awards granted under the Plan. Such adjustments may include: (a) adjustment in the number and kind of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan; (b) adjustment in the number and kind of shares covered by outstanding Awards; (c) adjustment in the exercise price of outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or the price of other Awards under the Plan; (d) adjustments to any of the share limitations set forth in Section 5.2 of the Plan; and (e) any other changes that the Board determines to be equitable under the circumstances.

Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Board may from time to time grant Stock Options to Participants. Stock Options granted under the Plan to Non-Employee Directors shall be NSOs. Unless otherwise expressly provided at the time of the grant, Stock Options granted under the Plan to Key Employees shall be NSOs. 

^^Stock Option Agreement. 

The grant of each Stock Option shall be evidenced by a written Stock Option Agreement specifying the type of Stock Option granted, the exercise period, the exercise price, the terms for payment of the exercise price, the expiration date of the Stock Option, the number of shares of Common Stock to be subject to each Stock Option and such other terms and conditions established by the Board, in its sole discretion, not inconsistent with the Plan. 

^^Exercise Price and Period. 

With respect to each Stock Option granted to a Participant: 

^^Except as provided in Section 6.4(b), the per share exercise price of each Stock Option shall be the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Stock Option on the date on which the Stock Option is granted. 

^^Each Stock Option shall become exercisable as set forth in the Stock Option Agreement; provided that in the case of Stock Options granted to participants who are Key Employees, no Stock Option shall become exercisable earlier than with respect to 1/3 of the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Stock Option on each of the three succeeding anniversaries of the date of the grant of the Stock Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Board shall have the discretion to accelerate the date as of which any Stock Option shall become exercisable in the event of the Key Employee’s termination of employment with the Company, or a Non-Employee Director’s termination of service on the Board, without Good Cause. 

^^No grant of a Stock Option shall include a “reload” Option pursuant to which a Participant who exercises a Stock Option and satisfies all or a portion of the exercise price with Shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option is granted an additional Stock Option to acquire the same number of Shares as is used by the Participant to pay such exercise price. 

^^Except as provided in Section 6.4(b), each Stock Option that has not terminated earlier as provided in the Stock Option Agreement shall expire, and all rights to purchase shares of Common Stock thereunder shall expire, on the date ten years after the date of grant. 

^^Required Terms and Conditions of ISOs. 

In addition to the foregoing, each ISO granted to a Key Employee shall be subject to the following specific rules: 

^^The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined with respect to each ISO at the time such Option is granted) of the shares of Common Stock with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a Key Employee during any calendar year (under all incentive stock option plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not exceed $[[USD Value 1: Number]] If the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time of grant) of the Common Stock subject to an ISO which first becomes exercisable in any calendar year exceeds the limitation of this Section 6.4(a), so much of the ISO that does not exceed the applicable dollar limit shall be an ISO and the remainder shall be a NSO; but in all other respects, the original Stock Option Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 

^^Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an ISO is granted to a Key Employee who owns stock possessing more than [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company (or its parent or subsidiaries within the meaning of Section 422(b)(6) of the Code): (i) the purchase price of each share of Common Stock subject to the ISO shall be not less than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the ISO is granted; and (ii) the ISO shall expire, and all rights to purchase shares of Common Stock thereunder shall expire, no later than the fifth anniversary of the date the ISO was granted. 

^^No ISOs shall be granted under the Plan after ten years from the earlier of the date the Plan is adopted or approved by stockholders of the Company, as described in Section 17.1 of the Plan. 

^^Exercise of Stock Options. 

^^A Participant entitled to exercise a Stock Option may do so by delivering written notice to that effect specifying the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Stock Option is being exercised and any other information the Board may prescribe. All notices or requests provided for herein shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company or such party as the Secretary may designate. 

^^The Board in its sole discretion may make available one or more of the following alternatives for the payment of the Stock Option exercise price: 

^^^in cash; 

^^^in cash received from a broker-dealer to whom the Participant has submitted an exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sales proceeds from the sale of the shares subject to the Stock Option to pay the exercise price; 

^^^by directing the Company to withhold the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable in connection with the exercise of the Stock Option that have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price; 

^^^by delivering previously acquired shares of Common Stock that are acceptable to the Board and that have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Stock Option exercise price; or 

^^by certifying to ownership by attestation of such previously acquired shares of Common Stock. 

The Board shall have the sole discretion to establish the terms and conditions applicable to any alternative made available for payment of the Stock Option exercise price. 

^^The Company shall issue, in the name of the Participant, stock certificates representing the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of any Stock Option as soon as reasonably practicable after such exercise; provided that any shares of Common Stock purchased by a Participant through a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 6.5(b)(ii) or Section 14 shall be delivered to such broker-dealer in accordance with 12 C.F.R. §220.3(e)(4) or other applicable provision of law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in lieu of issuing stock certificates, may reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Participant on a noncertificated basis, with the ownership of such shares by the Participant evidenced solely by book entry in the records of the Company’s transfer agent. 

^Stock Awards. 

^^Grant. 

The Board may, in its discretion, (a) grant shares of Common Stock under the Plan to any Participant without payment of consideration by such Participant or (b) sell shares of Common Stock under the Plan to any Participant for such amount of cash, Common Stock or other consideration as the Board deems appropriate. 

^^Stock Award Agreement. 

Each share of Common Stock issued to a Participant under this Section 7 shall be evidenced by a Stock Award Agreement, which shall specify whether the shares of Common Stock are granted or sold to the Participant and such other restrictions, terms and conditions (including the attainment of performance goals) established by the Board in its sole discretion, not inconsistent with the Plan and the following provisions: 

^^The restrictions to which the shares of Common Stock awarded hereunder are subject shall lapse as set forth in the Stock Award Agreement; provided that in the case of Stock Awards to Participants who are Key Employees: (i) none of the restrictions that are based solely on the elapse of time shall lapse earlier than with respect to 1/3 of the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Stock Award on each of the three succeeding anniversaries of the date of the grant of the Stock Award and (ii) none of the restrictions that are based on the attainment of performance goals as described in Section 3.3 of the Plan shall lapse earlier than the first anniversary of the date of the grant. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Board shall have the discretion to accelerate the date as of which the restrictions lapse with respect to a Stock Award in the event of a Key Employee’s termination of employment with the Company, or a Non-Employee Director’s termination of service on the Board, without Good Cause. 

^^Except as provided in this subsection (b) and unless otherwise provided in the Stock Award Agreement, the Participant receiving a grant of or purchasing Common Stock shall thereupon be a stockholder with respect to all of the shares subject to the Stock Award and shall have the rights of a stockholder with respect to such shares, including the right to vote such shares and to receive dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such shares. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the case of a Stock Award that provides for the right to receive dividends or distributions: (i) if such Stock Award is subject to performance-based restrictions as described in Section 3.3, the Company shall accumulate and hold such dividends or distributions, and (ii) in the case of all other such Stock Awards, the Board shall have the discretion to cause the Company to accumulate and hold such dividends or distributions. In either such case, the accumulated dividends or other distributions shall be paid to the Participant only upon the lapse of the restrictions to which the Stock Award is subject, and any such dividends or distributions attributable to the portion of a Stock Award for which the restrictions do not lapse shall be forfeited. 

^^The Company shall issue, in the name of the Participant, stock certificates representing the total number of shares of Common Stock granted or sold to the Participant, as soon as may be reasonably practicable after such grant or sale, which shall be held by the Secretary of the Company until such time as the Common Stock is forfeited, delivered to the Company, or the restrictions lapse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in lieu of issuing stock certificates, may reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Participant on a noncertificated basis, with the ownership of such shares by the Participant evidenced solely by book entry in the records of the Company’s transfer agent. 

^Stock Units. 

^^Grant. 

The Board may, in its discretion, grant Stock Units to any Participant. Each Stock Unit shall entitle the Participant to receive, on the date or upon the occurrence of an event (including the attainment of performance goals) as described in the Stock Unit Agreement, one share of Common Stock or cash equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of such event, as provided in the Stock Unit Agreement. 

^^Stock Unit Agreement. 

Each grant of Stock Units to a Participant under this Section 8 shall be evidenced by a Stock Unit Agreement, which shall specify the restrictions, terms and conditions established by the Board in its sole discretion, not inconsistent with the Plan and the following provisions: 

^^The restrictions to which the Stock Units awarded hereunder are subject shall lapse as set forth in the Stock Unit Agreement; provided that in the case of Stock Units granted to Participants who are Key Employees: (i) none of the restrictions that are based solely on the elapse of time shall lapse earlier than with respect to 1/3 of the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Award on each of the three succeeding anniversaries of the date of the grant of the Award and (ii) none of the restrictions that are based on the attainment of performance goals as described in Section 3.3 of the Plan shall lapse earlier than the first anniversary of the date of the grant of the Award. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Board shall have the discretion to accelerate the date as of which the restrictions lapse in the event of a Key Employee’s termination of employment with the Company, or a Non-Employee Director’s termination of service on the Board, without Good Cause. 

^^Except as provided in this subsection (b), and unless otherwise provided in the Stock Unit Agreement, a Participant shall have no rights of a stockholder, including voting or dividend or other distribution rights, with respect to any Stock Units prior to the date they are settled in shares of Common Stock. A Stock Unit Agreement may provide that, until the Stock Units are settled in shares of Common Stock or cash, the Participant shall receive, on each dividend or distribution payment date applicable to the Common Stock, an amount equal to the dividends or distributions that the Participant would have received had the Stock Units held by the Participant as of the related record date been actual shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the case of a Stock Unit Award that provides for the right to receive amounts related to dividends or distributions: (i) if such Stock Unit Award is subject to performance-based restrictions as described in Section 3.3, the Company shall accumulate and hold such amounts, and (ii) in the case of all other such Stock Unit Awards, the Board shall have the discretion to cause the Company to accumulate and hold such amounts. In either such case, the accumulated amounts shall be paid to the Participant only upon the lapse of the restrictions to which the Stock Unit Award is subject and any such amounts attributable to the portion of a Stock Unit Award for which the restrictions do not lapse shall be forfeited. 

^^Upon settlement of Stock Units in Common Stock, the Company shall issue, in the name of the Participant, stock certificates representing a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Stock Units being settled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in lieu of issuing stock certificates, may reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Participant on a noncertificated basis, with the ownership of such shares by the Participant evidenced solely by book entry in the records of the Company’s transfer agent. 

^Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs). 

^^Grant. 

The Board may, in its discretion, grant an SAR under the Plan to any Participant who is a Key Employee. Each SAR granted to a Participant shall entitle the Participant to elect to receive an amount (payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, determined by the Board and set forth in the related Stock Appreciation Right Agreement) equal to the excess of (a) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of such SAR, over (b) the exercise price of the SAR, multiplied by the number of shares of the Common Stock with respect to which the SAR is being exercised. 

^^Stock Appreciation Right Agreement. 

Each SAR granted under this Section 9 shall be evidenced by a Stock Appreciation Right Agreement, specifying the conditions for exercise, the exercise period, the exercise price, the expiration date, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each SAR, whether the SAR is to be settled in shares of Common Stock or cash and such other terms and conditions established by the Board in its sole discretion, not inconsistent with the Plan and the following provisions: 

^^The per share exercise price of each SAR shall be the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the SAR on the date on which the SAR is granted. 

^^Each SAR shall become exercisable as set forth in the Stock Appreciation Right Agreement; provided that in the case of SARs granted to Participants who are Key Employees, no SAR shall become exercisable earlier than with respect to 1/3 of the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to the SAR on each of the three succeeding anniversaries of the date of the grant of the SAR. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Board shall have the discretion to accelerate the date as of which any SAR shall become exercisable in the event of a Participant’s termination of employment with the Company without Good Cause. 

^^Unless a shorter period is provided in the Stock Appreciation Right Agreement, each SAR shall expire on the date ten years after the date of grant. 

^^Upon exercise of an SAR settled in Common Stock, the Company shall issue, in the name of the Participant, stock certificates representing the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in lieu of issuing stock certificates, may reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Participant on a noncertificated basis, with the ownership of such shares by the Participant evidenced solely by book entry in the records of the Company’s transfer agent. 

^Change in Control. 

^^Effect of Change in Control. 

Notwithstanding any of the provisions of the Plan or any outstanding Award Agreement, upon a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in Section 10.2):

Neither the adoption of the Plan nor the grant of any Award under the Plan shall be deemed to obligate the Company or any Subsidiary to continue the employment of any Participant for any particular period, nor shall the granting of an Award constitute a request or consent to postpone the retirement date of any Participant.
