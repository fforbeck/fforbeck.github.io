\centered **CHANGE IN CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT** 

THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of , 20___, is made by and between [[Company]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (the “Company”), and (the “Executive”). The capitalized words and terms used throughout this Agreement are defined in Article XIII. 

\centered **Recitals** 

^The Company considers it essential to the best interests of its shareholders to foster the continuous employment of key management personnel. 

^The Board recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a Change in Control exists and that such a possibility, and the uncertainty and questions that it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders. 

^The Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company’s management, including the Executive, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a Change in Control. 

^The parties intend that no amount or benefit will be payable under this Agreement unless a termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company occurs following a Change in Control, or is deemed to have occurred following a Change in Control, as provided in this Agreement. 

^^^^^

or benefit plan, program, or arrangement maintained by the Company during the period of Disability. 

SECTION 2.02.  Compensation Previously Earned.

SECTION 2.03.  Normal Post-Termination Compensation and Benefits.

^^^^^ 
\centered **Severance Payments** 

SECTION 3.01.  Payment Triggers.  

^^In lieu of any other severance compensation or benefits to which the Executive may otherwise be entitled under any plan, program, policy, or arrangement of the Company (and which the Executive hereby expressly waives), the Company will pay the Executive the Severance Payments described in Section 3.02 upon termination of the Executive’s employment following a Change in Control and during the term of this Agreement, in addition to the payments and benefits described in Article II, unless the termination is (1) by the Company for Cause, (2) by reason of the Executive’s death, or (3) by the Executive without Good Reason. 

^^For purposes of this Section 3.01, the Executive’s employment will be deemed to have been terminated following a Change in Control by the Company without Cause or by the Executive with Good Reason if (1) the Executive’s employment is terminated without Cause prior to a Change in Control at the direction of a Person who has entered into an agreement with the Company, the consummation of which will constitute a Change in Control; or (2) the Executive terminates his employment with Good Reason prior to a Change in Control (determined by treating a Potential Change in Control as a Change in Control in applying the definition of Good Reason), if the circumstance or event that constitutes Good Reason occurs at the direction of such a Person. 

^^The Severance Payments described in this Article III are subject to the conditions stated in Article VI. 

SECTION 3.02.  Severance Payments. The following are the Severance Payments referenced in Section 3.01: 

^^^^^ 
^^Lump Sum Severance Payment. In lieu of any further salary payments to the Executive for periods after the Date of Termination, and in lieu of any severance benefits otherwise payable to the Executive, the Company will pay to the Executive, in accordance with Section 3.04, a lump sum severance payment, in cash, equal to two (or, if less, the number of years, including fractions, from the Date of Termination until the Executive reaches his Retirement Date), times the sum of (1) the higher of the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the event or circumstance upon which the Notice of Termination is based or in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, and (2) if Severance Payments are triggered under Section 3.01(a), the amount of the Executive’s target annual bonus entitlement under the Incentive Plan (or any other bonus plan of the Company then in effect) as in effect immediately prior to the event or circumstance giving rise to the Notice of Termination, or, if Severance Payments are triggered under Section 3.01(b), the amount of the largest aggregate annual bonus paid to the Executive with respect to the three years immediately prior to the year in which the Notice of Termination was given. If the Board determines that it is not workable to determine the amount that the Executive’s target bonus would have been for the year in which the Notice of Termination was given, then, for purposes of this paragraph (a), the Executive’s target annual bonus entitlement will be the amount of the largest aggregate annual bonus paid to the Executive with respect to the three years immediately prior to the year in which the Notice of Termination was given. 

^^Incentive Compensation. Notwithstanding any provision of the Incentive Plan or any other compensation or incentive plans of the Company, the Company will pay to the Executive, in accordance with Section 3.04, a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the sum of (1) any incentive compensation that has been allocated or awarded to the Executive for a 

^^^^^ 
completed calendar year or other measuring period preceding the Date of Termination (to the extent not payable pursuant to Section 2.02) provided that, if Severance Payments are triggered under Section 3.01(b), the performance conditions applicable to such incentive compensation are met, and (2) if Severance Payments are triggered under Section 3.01(a), a pro rata portion (based on elapsed time) to the Date of Termination of the aggregate value of all contingent incentive compensation awards to the Executive for the current calendar year or other measuring period under the Incentive Plan, the Award Plan, or any other compensation or incentive plans of the Company, calculated as to each such plan using the Executive’s annual target percentage under that plan for that year or other measuring period and as if all conditions for receiving that target award had been met, or, if Severance Payments are triggered under Section 3.01(b), then with respect to each such plan, an amount equal to the average annual award paid to the Executive under such plan during the three years immediately prior to the year in which the Notice of Termination was given multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole months elapsed since the beginning of the calendar year or other measuring period to the Date of Termination and the denominator of which is 12 (or the number of whole months in the measuring period). 

^^Options and Restricted Shares. All outstanding Options will become immediately vested and exercisable (to the extent not yet vested and exercisable as of the Date of Termination). To the extent not otherwise provided under the written agreement evidencing the grant of any restricted Shares to the Executive, all outstanding Shares that have been granted to the Executive subject to restrictions that, as of the Date of Termination, have not yet lapsed will lapse automatically upon the Date of Termination, and the Executive will own those Shares free and clear of all such restrictions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, options and restricted Shares 

^^^^^ 
remain subject to any forfeiture or clawback claims under the applicable option plan or award agreement. 

^^Welfare Benefits. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.02(d), for a 24-month period after the Date of Termination, the Company will arrange to provide the Executive with life insurance coverage substantially similar to that which the Executive is receiving from the Company immediately prior to the Notice of Termination (without giving effect to any reduction in that coverage subsequent to a Change in Control). Life insurance coverage otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Section 3.02(d) will be reduced to the extent comparable coverage is actually received by or made available to the Executive without greater cost to him than as provided by the Company during the 24-month period following the Executive’s termination of employment (and the Executive will report to the Company any such coverage actually received by or made available to the Executive). 

If, as of the Date of Termination, the Company reasonably determines that the continued life insurance coverage required by this Section 3.02(d) is not available from the Company’s group insurance carrier, cannot be procured from another carrier, and cannot be provided on a self-insured basis without adverse tax consequences to the Executive or his death beneficiary, then, in lieu of continued life insurance coverage, the Company will pay the Executive, in accordance with Section 3.04, a lump sum payment, in cash, equal to 24 times the full monthly premium payable to the Company’s group insurance carrier for comparable coverage for an executive employee under the Company’s group life insurance plan then in effect. 

The Company will offer the Executive and any eligible family members the opportunity to elect to continue medical and dental coverage pursuant to COBRA. The Executive will be responsible for paying the required monthly premium for that coverage, but the 

^^^^^ 
Company will pay the Executive, in accordance with Section 3.04, a lump sum cash stipend equal to 24 times the monthly COBRA premium then charged to qualified beneficiaries for the same level of health and dental coverage the Executive had in effect immediately prior to his termination, and the Executive may, but is not required to, choose to use the stipend for the payment of COBRA premiums for any COBRA coverage that the Executive or eligible family members may elect. The Company will pay the stipend to the Executive whether or not the Executive or any eligible family member elects COBRA coverage, whether or not the Executive continues COBRA coverage for the maximum period permitted by law, and whether or not the Executive receives medical or dental coverage from another employer while the Executive is receiving COBRA continuation coverage. Payment of the stipend will not in any way extend or modify the Executive’s continuation coverage rights under COBRA or any similar continuation coverage law. 

^^Matching and Fixed Contributions. In addition to the vested amounts, if any, to which the Executive is entitled under the Savings Plan as of the Date of Termination, the Company will pay the Executive, in accordance with Section 3.04, a lump sum amount equal to the value of the unvested portion, if any, of the employer matching and fixed contributions (and attributable earnings) credited to the Executive under the Savings Plan. 

^^Outplacement Services. For a period not to exceed six (6) months following the Date of Termination, the Company will provide the Executive with reasonable outplacement services consistent with past practices of the Company prior to the Change in Control or, if no past practice has been established prior to the Change in Control, consistent with the prevailing practice in the medical device manufacturing industry. 

^^^^^ 
^Limitation on Severance Payments. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that any Severance Payments paid or payable to the Executive or for his benefit pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise in connection with a Change in Control (“Total Payments”) would be subject to any Excise Tax, then the value of the Total Payments will be reduced to the extent necessary so that, within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii), the aggregate present value of the payments in the nature of compensation to (or for the benefit of) the Executive that are contingent on a Change in Control (with a Change in Control for this purpose being defined in terms of a “change” described in Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) or (ii)), do not exceed 2.999 multiplied by the Base Amount. For this purpose, cash Severance Payments will be reduced first (if necessary, to zero), and all other, non-cash Severance Payments will be reduced next (if necessary, to zero). For purposes of the limitation described in the preceding sentence, the following will not be taken into account: (1) any portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which the Executive effectively waived in writing prior to the Date of Termination, and (2) any portion of the Total Payments that, in the opinion of the Accounting Firm, does not constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2). 

^^For purposes of this Section 3.03, the determination of whether any portion of the Total Payments would be subject to an Excise Tax will be made by an Accounting Firm selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive. For purposes of that determination, the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments will be determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the principles of Section 280G(d)(3) and (4). 

^^^^^ 
^Time of Payment. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 3.02, payments provided for in that Section will be made as follows: 

^^Subject to Section 3.04(d), no later than the fifth business day following the Date of Termination, the Company will pay to the Executive an estimate, as determined by the Company in good faith, of [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the minimum amount of the payments under Section 3.02 to which the Executive is clearly entitled. 

^^Subject to Section 3.04(d), the Company will pay to the Executive the remainder of the payments due him under Section 3.02 (together with interest at the rate provided in Code Section 1274(b)(2)(B)) not later than the 30th business day after the Date of Termination. 

^^At the time that payment is made under Section 3.04(b), the Company will provide the Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in which all of the payments to him under this Agreement were calculated and the basis for the calculations including, without limitation, any opinions or other advice the Company received from auditors or consultants (other than legal counsel) with respect to the calculations (and any such opinions or advice that are in writing will be attached to the statement). 

^^Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if, as of the date of the Executive’s separation from service, the Executive is a “specified employee” under the Section 409A Standards, any and all payments under this Agreement that constitute deferred compensation under the Section 409A Standards shall be suspended until, and will be payable on, the date that is six (6) months after the Executive’s separation from service (or, if earlier, the date the Executive dies after separation from service). 

^^^^^ 
^Attorneys Fees and Expenses. To the extent permissible under the Section 409A Standards, if the Executive finally prevails with respect to any bona fide, good faith dispute between the Executive and the Company regarding the interpretation, terms, validity or enforcement of this Agreement (including any dispute as to the amount of any payment due under this Agreement), the Company will pay or reimburse the Executive for all reasonable attorneys fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with that dispute pursuant to the terms of this paragraph. Payment or reimbursement of those fees and expenses will be made within fifteen (15) business days after delivery of the Executive’s written request for payment, accompanied by such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company reasonably may require, but the Executive may not submit such a request until the dispute has been finally resolved by a legally binding settlement or by an order or judgment that is not subject to appeal or with respect to which all appeals have been exhausted. Any payment pursuant to this paragraph will be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the dispute is finally resolved by a legally binding settlement or nonappealable judgment or order. 

In addition, the Company will pay the reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of Code Section 4999 to any payment or benefit provided under this Agreement and including, but not limited to, auditors’ fees incurred in connection with the audit or proceeding. Payment pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made within fifteen (15) business days after the delivery of the Executive’s written request for payment, accompanied by such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company reasonably may require, but in no case later than the 

^^^^^ 
end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the audit is completed or there is a final and nonappealable settlement or other resolution of the matter. 

\centered **Termination of Employment** 

SECTION 4.01.  Notice of Termination. After a Change in Control and during the term of this Agreement, any purported termination of the Executive’s employment (other than by reason of death) will be communicated by a written Notice of Termination from one party to the other party in accordance with Article VIII. The Notice of Termination will indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and will set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive’s employment under the cited provision. 

SECTION 4.02.  Date of Termination. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.01, with respect to any purported termination of the Executive’s employment after a Change in Control and during the term of this Agreement, the term “Date of Termination” will have the meaning set forth in this Section. If the Executive’s employment is terminated for Disability, Date of Termination means thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given, provided that the Executive does not return to the full-time performance of the Executive’s duties during that 30-day period. If the Executive’s employment is terminated for any other reason, Date of Termination means the date specified in the Notice of Termination, which, in the case of a termination by the Company, cannot be less than 30 days (except in the case of a termination for Cause) and, in the case of a termination by the Executive, cannot be less than 15 days nor more than 60 days from the date on which the Notice of Termination is given. 

^^^^^ 
\centered **No Mitigation** 

The Company agrees that, if the Executive’s employment by the Company is terminated during the term of this Agreement, the Executive is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to the Executive by the Company pursuant to Article III. Further, the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in Article III (other than Section 3.02(d)) will not be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by the Executive to the Company, or otherwise. 

\centered **The Executive’s Covenants** 

SECTION 6.01.  Noncompetition Agreement. In consideration for this Agreement, the Executive will execute, concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, a noncompetition agreement with the Company; provided, however, that if the Executive has an existing noncompetition agreement with the Company, the Company, rather than entering into a new noncompetition agreement with the Executive, may instead, as a condition to entering into this agreement, require that the Executive acknowledge and affirm his continuing obligations under such existing noncompetition agreement and re-affirm his agreement to honor the obligations as set forth in that document. 

SECTION 6.02.  Potential Change in Control. The Executive agrees that, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in the event of a Potential Change in Control during the term of this Agreement, the Executive will remain employed by the Company until the earliest of (a) a date that is six months from the date of the Potential Change of Control, 

^^^^^ 
^^the date of a Change in Control, (c) the date on which the Executive terminates employment for Good Reason (determined by treating the Potential Change in Control as a Change in Control in applying the definition of Good Reason) or by reason of death, or (d) the date the Company terminates the Executive’s employment for any reason. 

SECTION 6.03.  General Release. The Executive agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Executive will not be eligible for any Severance Payments under this Agreement unless the Executive timely signs, and does not timely revoke, a General Release in substantially the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. The Executive will be given 21 days to consider the terms of the General Release. The General Release will not become effective until seven days following the date the General Release is executed. If the Executive does not return the executed General Release to the Company by the end of the 21 day period, that failure will be deemed a refusal to sign, and the Executive will not be entitled to receive any Severance Payments under this Agreement. In certain circumstances, the 21 day period to consider the General Release may be extended to a 45 day period. The Executive will be advised in writing if the 45 day period is applicable. In the absence of such notice, the 21 day period applies. 

\centered **Successors; Binding Agreement** 

SECTION 7.01.  Obligation of Successors.  

^^In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any successor to the Company, the Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the 

^^^^^ 
Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no succession had occurred. 

^^Subject to Section 7.01(c), failure of the Company to obtain such an assumption and agreement under Section 7.01(a) prior to the effectiveness of any such succession will be a breach of this Agreement and will entitle the Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount as the Executive would be entitled to under this Agreement if the Executive were to terminate employment for Good Reason after a Change in Control, except that, for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which the succession becomes effective will be deemed the Date of Termination. 

^^Payment of benefits under Section 7.01(b) shall be made on the deemed Date of Termination if, and only if, the succession resulted from a transaction that satisfies the definition of change in control under Section 409A of the Code. If the transaction does not satisfy the definition of change in control under Section 409A, payment of benefits due under Section 7.01(b) shall be made within 30 days of the Executive’s actual date of termination of employment, subject to the provisions of Section 3.04(d). No interest or earnings shall be paid due to any delay in payment under this Section 7.01(c). 

SECTION 7.02.  Enforcement Rights of Others. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive’s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If the Executive dies while any amount is still payable to the Executive under this Agreement, (other than amounts that, by their terms, terminate upon the Executive’s death), then, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all such amounts will be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the executors, personal representatives, or administrators of the Executive’s estate. 

^^^^^ 
\centered **Notices** 

For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in the Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the respective addresses set forth below, or to such other address as either party may furnish to the other in writing in accordance with this Article VIII, except that notice of change of address will be effective only upon actual receipt:

This Agreement will not be construed as creating an express or implied contract of employment and, except as otherwise agreed in writing between the Executive and the Company, the Executive will not have any right to be retained in the employ of the Company. No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived, or discharged unless the waiver, modification, or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and an officer of the Company specifically designated by the Board. No waiver by either party at any time of any 

^^^^^ 
breach by the other party of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by the other party will be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any other time. Neither party has made any agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement that are not expressly set forth in this Agreement. Except as provided in the following two sentences, the validity, interpretation, construction, and performance of this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, to the extent not preempted by federal law. This Agreement will at all times be effected, construed, interpreted, and applied in a manner consistent with the Section 409A Standards, and in resolving any uncertainty as to the meaning or intention of any provision of this Agreement, the interpretation that will prevail is the interpretation that causes the Agreement to comply with the Section 409A Standards. In addition, to the extent that any terms of this Agreement would subject the Executive to gross income inclusion, interest, or additional tax pursuant to Code Section 409A, those terms are to that extent superseded by the applicable Section 409A Standards. All references to sections of the Exchange Act or the Code will be deemed also to refer to any successor provisions to those sections. Any payments provided for under this Agreement will be paid net of any applicable withholding required under federal, state, or local law and any additional withholding to which the Executive has agreed. The obligations of the Company and the Executive under Articles III, IV, and VI will survive the expiration of the term of this Agreement.

\centered **Validity** 

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or this Agreement will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect. 

\centered **Counterparts** 

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 

\centered **Settlement of Disputes; Arbitration** 

All claims by the Executive for benefits under this Agreement must be in writing and will be directed to and determined by the Board. Any denial by the Board of a claim for benefits under this Agreement will be delivered to the Executive in writing and will set forth the specific reasons for the denial and the specific provisions of this Agreement relied upon. The Board will afford a reasonable opportunity to the Executive for a review of the decision denying a claim and will further allow the Executive to appeal to the Board a decision of the Board within 60 days after notification by the Board that the Executive’s claim has been denied. Any further dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement will be settled exclusively by arbitration in [[Address 2: Address]] accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court having jurisdiction. Each party will bear its own expenses in the arbitration for attorneys’ fees, for its witnesses, and for other expenses of presenting its case. Other arbitration costs, 

^^^^^ 
including arbitrators’ fees, administrative fees, and fees for records or transcripts, will be borne equally by the parties. Notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, if the Executive prevails with respect to any dispute submitted to arbitration under this Article, the Company will reimburse or pay all reasonable legal fees and expenses that the Executive incurred in connection with that dispute as required by Section 3.05.
