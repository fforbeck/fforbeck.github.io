WHEREAS, the Company considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to foster the continued employment of key management personnel; and

WHEREAS, the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company’s management, including the Executive, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a Change in Control; and

WHEREAS, also in furtherance of the best interests of the Company’s stockholders, in connection with the execution of this Agreement, the Executive has agreed to enter into a new Fair Competition Agreement and a new Confidentiality Agreement with the Company;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants herein contained, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows:

immediately prior to the occurrence of the first event or circumstance constituting Good Reason. 

^Severance Payments.  

^^Severance Payments Obligation. Subject to Section 6.2 hereof, if the Executive’s employment is terminated following a Change in Control and during the Term, other than (A) by the Company for Cause, (B) by reason of death or Disability, or (C) by the Executive without Good Reason, then the Company shall pay the Executive the amounts, and provide the Executive the benefits, described in this Section 6.1 (“Severance Payments”), in addition to any payments and benefits to which the Executive is entitled under Section 5 hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive’s employment shall be deemed to have been terminated following a Change in Control by the Company without Cause or by the Executive with Good Reason, if (i) the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause prior to a Change in Control (but only if a Change in Control occurs no later than six (6) months following the Executive’s termination of employment) and such termination was at the request or direction of a Person who has entered into an agreement with the Company the consummation of which would constitute a Change in Control, (ii) the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason prior to a Change in Control (but only if a Change in Control occurs no later than six (6) months following the Executive’s termination of employment) and the circumstance or event which constitutes Good Reason occurs at the request or direction of such Person, or (iii) the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason and such termination or the circumstance or event which constitutes Good Reason is otherwise in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in Control (but only if a Change in Control occurs no later than six (6) months following the Executive’s termination of employment).

^^^^^ 
Termination and in lieu of any severance benefit otherwise payable to the Executive, the Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum severance payment, in cash, equal to one (1) times the sum of (i) the Executive’s base salary as in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if higher, in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, and (ii) the Executive’s target annual bonus under any annual bonus or incentive plan maintained by the Company in respect of the fiscal year in which occurs the Date of Termination or, if higher, the fiscal year in which occurs the first event or circumstance constituting Good Reason. 

^Insurance Benefits Continuation. For the twelve (12)- month period immediately following the Date of Termination, the Company shall arrange to provide the Executive and his dependents life, accident and health insurance benefits substantially similar to those provided to the Executive and his dependents immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided to the Executive and his dependents immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, at no greater after-tax cost to the Executive than the after-tax cost to the Executive immediately prior to such date or occurrence; provided, however, that, unless the Executive consents to a different method, such health insurance benefits shall be provided through a third-party insurer. Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Section 6.1(B) shall be reduced to the extent benefits of the same type are received by or made available to the Executive during the twelve (12)-month period following the Executive’s termination of employment (and any such benefits received by or made available to the Executive shall be reported to the Company by the Executive); provided, however, that the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the excess, if any, of the after-tax cost of such benefits to the Executive over such cost immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason. If the Severance Payments shall be decreased pursuant to 

\centered -Page 5 of 24- 

^^^^^ 
^hereof, and the Section 6.1(B) benefits which remain payable after the application of Section 6.2 hereof are thereafter reduced pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall, no later than five (5) business days following such reduction, pay to the Executive the least of (a) the amount of the decrease made in the Severance Payments pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof, (b) the amount of the subsequent reduction in these Section 6.1(B) benefits, or (c) the maximum amount which can be paid to the Executive without being, or causing any other payment to be, nondeductible by reason of section 280G of the Code. 

^Accelerated Vesting of Equity Awards. Notwithstanding any provision of any equity award plan or agreement to the contrary, (i) each outstanding stock option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit, or other long-term equity incentive award held by the Executive shall vest (whether the vesting criteria are time-based, performance-based or otherwise) and become non-forfeitable on the Date of Termination and (ii) each outstanding stock option (other than a stock option that is intended to qualify as “incentive stock option” under Section 422 of the Code and that has an exercise price that is less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date hereof) and stock appreciation right shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Date of Termination (but in no event beyond the date such stock option or stock appreciation right would have expired had the Executive remained employed with the Company). 

^Lump Sum Incentive Payment. Notwithstanding any provision of any annual or long term incentive plan to the contrary, the Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the sum of (i) any unpaid incentive compensation which has been allocated or awarded to the Executive for a completed fiscal year or other measuring period preceding the Date of Termination under any such plan and which, as of the Date of Termination, is contingent only upon the continued employment of the Executive to a subsequent date, and (ii) a pro rata portion to the Date of Termination of the aggregate value of 

\centered -Page 6 of 24- 

^^^^^ 
all contingent incentive compensation awards to the Executive for all then uncompleted periods under any such plan, calculated as to each such award by multiplying the award that the Executive would have earned on the last day of the performance award period, assuming the achievement, at the target level, of the individual and corporate performance goals established with respect to such award, by the fraction obtained by dividing the number of full months and any fractional portion of a month during such performance award period through the Date of Termination by the total number of months contained in such performance award period. 

^Post-Retirement Insurance Benefits. If the Executive would have become entitled to benefits under any Company post-retirement health care or life insurance plans, as in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, had the Executive’s employment terminated at any time during the period of twelve (12) months after the Date of Termination, the Company shall provide such post-retirement health care or life insurance benefits to the Executive and the Executive’s dependents commencing on the later of (i) the date on which such coverage would have first become available and (ii) the date on which benefits described in subsection (B) of this Section 6.1 terminate. 

^Outplacement Services. The Company shall provide the Executive with outplacement services suitable to the Executive’s position for a period of two years or, if earlier, until the first acceptance by the Executive of an offer of employment. 

^^(A) Excise Tax Adjustment. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Executive (including any payment or benefit received or to be received in connection with a Change in Control or the termination of the Executive’s employment, whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, 

\centered -Page 7 of 24- 

^^^^^ 
arrangement or agreement) (all such payments and benefits, including the Severance Payments, being hereinafter referred to as the “Total Payments”) would be subject (in whole or part), to the Excise Tax, then, after taking into account any reduction in the Total Payments provided by reason of section 280G of the Code in such other plan, arrangement or agreement, the cash Severance Payments that do not constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A shall first be reduced, all other Severance Payments that do not constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A shall be next reduced, and all other Severance Payments that do constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A shall thereafter be reduced (beginning with those payments last to be paid), to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (A) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (B) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which the Executive would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments); provided, however, that, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the Executive may elect to have the noncash Severance Payments reduced (or eliminated) prior to any reduction of the cash Severance Payments. 

^Excise Tax Determination. For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which the Executive shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a “payment” within the meaning of 

\centered -Page 8 of 24- 

^^^^^ 
280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of tax counsel (“Tax Counsel”) reasonably acceptable to the Executive and selected by the accounting firm (the “Auditor”) which was, immediately prior to the Change in Control, the Company’s independent auditor, does not constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, no portion of such Total Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the Base Amount allocable to such reasonable compensation, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of this Section 6.2, (1) the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the applicable Total Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive’s residence in the calendar year in which the applicable Total Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes and (2) except to the extent that the Executive otherwise notifies the Company, the Executive shall be deemed to be subject to the loss of itemized deductions and personal exemptions to the maximum extent provided by the Code for each dollar of incremental income. 

^Payments Calculation Notice. At the time that payments are made under this Agreement, the Company shall provide the Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in which such payments were calculated and the basis for such calculations including, without limitation, any opinions or other advice the Company has received from Tax Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors or consultants (and any such opinions or advice which are in 

\centered -Page 9 of 24- 

^^^^^ 
writing shall be attached to the statement). If the Executive objects to the Company’s calculations, the Company shall pay to the Executive such portion of the Severance Payments (up to [[Percentage 1: Number]]% thereof) as the Executive determines is necessary to result in the proper application of subsection A of this Section 6.2. 

^^Timing of Payments. Subject to the provisions of Section 15 hereof, the payments provided in subsections (A) (D) and (E) of Section 6.1 hereof and in Section 6.2 hereof shall be made not later than the fifth day following the Date of Termination Notwithstanding the above, to the extent the Executive is terminated (i) following a Change in Control but prior to a change in ownership or control of the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code or (ii) prior to a Change in Control in a manner described in Section 6.1, to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts payable to the Executive hereunder, to the extent not in excess of the amount that the Executive would have received under any other pre-Change in Control severance plan or arrangement with the Company had such plan or arrangement been applicable, shall be paid at the time and in the manner provided by such plan or arrangement and the remainder shall be paid to the Executive in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.3. 

^^Legal Fees and Expenses. The Company also shall pay to the Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in disputing in good faith any issue hereunder relating to the termination of the Executive’s employment, in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any benefit or right provided by this Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of section 4999 of the Code to any payment or benefit provided hereunder. Such payments shall be made within five (5) business days after delivery of the Executive’s written requests for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company reasonably may require; provided that in no event will payment be made for requests that are submitted later than [[Date 6: Date]] of the year following the year in which the expense is incurred.

^Section 409A. The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with section 409A of the Code to the extent subject thereto, and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required to avoid the application of an accelerated or additional tax under section 409A of the Code, the Executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company for purposes of this Agreement until such time as the Executive is considered to have incurred a “separation from service” from the Company within the meaning of section 409A of the Code. Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed as a separately identified payment for purposes of section 409A of the Code, and any payments that are due within the “short term deferral period” as defined in section 409A of the Code shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. To the extent required to avoid the application of an accelerated or additional tax under section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following the Executive’s termination of employment shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Executive’s termination of employment (or upon the Executive’s death, if earlier). To the extent required to avoid an accelerated or additional tax under section 409A of the Code, amounts reimbursable to Executive under this Agreement shall be paid to Executive on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and
