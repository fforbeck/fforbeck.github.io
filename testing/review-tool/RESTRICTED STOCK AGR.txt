^^ \centered (d) Effect of a For Cause Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event the Company or a Subsidiary terminates the Participant’s employment or service for “cause”(for purposes hereof, “cause” shall mean a vote by the Board of Directors resolving that the Participant shall be dismissed as a result of (i) any material breach by the Participant of any agreement between the Participant and the Company; (ii) the conviction of or plea of nolo contendere by the Participant to a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude; or (iii) any material misconduct or willful and deliberate non-performance (other than by reason of disability) by the Participant of the Participant’s duties to the Company) or in the event the Board of Directors determines, within one year after the Participant’s termination, that either prior or subsequent to the Participant’s termination the Participant engaged in conduct that would constitute “cause,” all of the Granted Shares (regardless of whether they are then subject to the Company’s Lapsing Forfeiture Right) then held by the Participant shall be forfeited to the Company immediately as of the time the Participant is notified that he or she has been terminated for “cause” or that he or she engaged in conduct which would constitute “cause”. 

The Administrator’s determination of the reason for termination of the Participant’s employment shall be conclusive and binding on the Participant and his or her representatives or legatees.

^^Escrow. The certificates representing all Granted Shares acquired by the Participant hereunder which from time to time are subject to the Lapsing Forfeiture Right shall be delivered to the Company and the Company shall hold such Granted Shares in escrow as provided in this Section 2(e). Upon the request of the Participant, the Company shall promptly release from escrow and deliver to the Participant the whole number of Granted Shares, if any, as to which the Company’s Lapsing

Forfeiture Right has lapsed and without the legend set forth in Section 5. In the event of forfeiture to the Company of Granted Shares subject to the Lapsing Forfeiture Right, the Company shall release from escrow and cancel a certificate for the number of Granted Shares so forfeited. Any securities distributed in respect of the Granted Shares held in escrow, including, without limitation, shares issued as a result of stock splits, stock dividends or other recapitalizations, shall also be held in escrow in the same manner as the Granted Shares.

^^Prohibition on Transfer. The Participant recognizes and agrees that all Granted Shares which are subject to the Lapsing Forfeiture Right may not be sold, transferred, assigned, hypothecated, pledged, encumbered or otherwise disposed of, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, other than to the Company. The Company shall not be required to transfer any Granted Shares on its books which shall have been sold, assigned or otherwise transferred in violation of this Section 2(f), or to treat as the owner of such Granted Shares, or to accord the right to vote as such owner or to pay dividends to, any person or organization to which any such Granted Shares shall have been so sold, assigned or otherwise transferred, in violation of this Section 2(f).

^^Failure to Deliver Granted Shares to be Forfeited. In the event that the Granted Shares to be forfeited to the Company under this Agreement are not in the Company’s possession pursuant to Section 2(e) above or otherwise and the Participant fails to deliver such Granted Shares to the Company, the Company may immediately take such action as is appropriate to transfer record title of such Granted Shares from the Participant to the Company and treat the Participant and such Granted Shares in all respects as if delivery of such Granted Shares had been made as required by this Agreement. The Participant hereby irrevocably grants the Company a power of attorney which shall be coupled with an interest for the purpose of effectuating the preceding sentence.

^Securities Law Compliance. The Participant specifically acknowledges and agrees that any sales of Granted Shares shall be made in accordance with the requirements of the 1933 Act.

^Rights as a Stockholder. The Participant shall have all the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Granted Shares, including voting and dividend rights, subject to the transfer and other restrictions set forth herein and in the Plan.

^Legend. In addition to any legend required pursuant to the Plan, all certificates representing the Granted Shares to be issued to the Participant pursuant to this Agreement shall have endorsed thereon a legend substantially as follows:

“The shares represented by this certificate are subject to restrictions set forth in a Restricted Stock Agreement dated as of , 20XX with this Company, a copy of which Agreement is available for inspection at the offices of the Company or will be made available upon request.”

^Incorporation of the Plan. The Participant specifically understands and agrees that the Granted Shares issued under the Plan are being sold to the Participant pursuant to the Plan, a copy of which Plan the Participant acknowledges he or she has read and understands and by which Plan he or she agrees to be bound. The provisions of the Plan are incorporated herein by reference.

^Tax Liability of the Participant and Payment of Taxes. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that any income or other taxes due from the Participant with respect to the Granted Shares issued pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Lapsing Forfeiture Right, shall be the Participant’s responsibility. Without limiting the foregoing, the Participant agrees that, to the extent that the lapsing of restrictions on disposition of any of the Granted Shares or the declaration of dividends on any such shares before the lapse of such restrictions on disposition results in the Participant’s being deemed to be in receipt of earned income under the provisions of the Code, the Company shall be entitled to immediate payment from the Participant of the amount of any tax required to be withheld by the Company.

In connection with the foregoing, the Participant agrees that if an arrangement to pay the withholding obligation in cash has not been received by the Company prior to the date that Granted Shares shall be released from the Lapsing Forfeiture Right, the Company shall authorize a registered broker (the “Broker”) to sell on such date such number of Granted Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant on that date as the Company instructs the Broker to sell to satisfy the Company’s withholding obligation, after deduction of the Broker’s commission, and the Broker shall remit to the Company the cash necessary in order for the Company to satisfy its withholding obligation. If such sale is not sufficient to pay the withholding obligation the Participant agrees to pay to the Company as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, the amounts that are not satisfied by the sale of shares of Common Stock. The Participant agrees to hold the Company and the Broker harmless from all costs, damages or expenses relating to any such sale. The Participant acknowledges that the Company and the Broker are under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price. In connection with such sale of Granted Shares, the Participant shall execute any such documents requested by Broker in order to effectuate the sale of the Granted Shares and payment of the withholding obligation to the Company. The Company shall not deliver any of the Granted Shares to the Participant until all withholdings have been made. The Participant acknowledges that this paragraph is intended to comply with Section 10b5-1(c)(1(i)(B) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to require the withholding obligation to be made in cash instead of through the sale of shares of Common Stock if it reasonably believes that the sale of shares would violate applicable securities laws.

Upon execution of this Agreement, the Participant may file an election under Section 83 of the Code. The Participant acknowledges that if he does not file such an election, as the Granted Shares are released from the Lapsing Forfeiture Right in accordance with Section 2, the Participant will have income for tax purposes equal to the fair market value of the Granted Shares at such date, less the price paid for the Granted Shares by the Participant.

^Equitable Relief. The Participant specifically acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement or the Plan, including the attempted transfer of the Granted Shares by the Participant in violation of this Agreement, monetary damages may not be adequate to compensate the Company, and, therefore, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any right to damages, the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief in any court having competent jurisdiction. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it for any such breach or threatened breach.

^No Obligation to Maintain Relationship. The Company is not by the Plan or this Agreement obligated to continue the Participant as an employee or consultant of the Company or a Subsidiary. The Participant acknowledges: (i) that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be suspended or terminated by the Company at any time; (ii) that the grant of the Shares is a one-time benefit which does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of shares, or benefits in lieu of shares; (iii) that all determinations with respect to any such future grants, including, but not limited to, the times when shares shall be granted, the number of shares to be granted, the purchase price, and the time or times when each share shall be free from a lapsing forfeiture right, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (iv) that the Participant’s participation in the Plan is voluntary; (v) that the value of the Shares is an extraordinary item of compensation which is outside the scope of the Participant’s employment contract, if any; and (vi) that the Shares are not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments.
