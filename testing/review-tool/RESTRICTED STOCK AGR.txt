^**Restrictions**.  

^^The Participant shall have all rights and privileges of a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to the Restricted Shares, including voting rights and the right to receive dividends paid with respect to the Restricted Shares, except that the following restrictions shall apply until such time or times as these restrictions lapse under Section 3 or any other provision of this Agreement: 

^^^the Participant shall not be entitled to delivery of any certificates for any of the Restricted Shares until the restrictions imposed by this Agreement have lapsed with respect to those Restricted Shares; 

^^^the Restricted Shares may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the Participant before these restrictions have lapsed, except with the consent of the Corporation; and 

^^^the Restricted Shares shall be subject to forfeiture upon termination of the Participant’s employment with the Corporation to the extent set forth in Section 6 below. 

If any portion of the Restricted Shares become vested under Section 3 below (or Sections 6, 7, 8 or 9), such newly vested shares shall no longer be subject to the preceding restrictions. 

^^Any attempt to dispose of Restricted Shares in a manner contrary to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement shall be ineffective. 

^**Vesting; When Restrictions Lapse**.  

The Restricted Shares shall vest in five annual installments, on , 20 and the next four anniversaries of such date, or at such earlier time as the restrictions may lapse pursuant to Sections 6, 7, 8 or 9 of this Agreement. In the absence of

^**Issuance of Shares**.  

The book entry for the Restricted Shares shall bear the following legend: 

“The transferability of the shares of stock represented hereby is subject to the terms and conditions (including possible forfeiture) of a Restricted Stock Agreement entered into between the registered owner and [[Corporation]] A copy of such Restricted Stock Agreement is on file in the offices of the Corporate Secretary, [[Corporation]], One SeaGate, Suite 1500, [[Address 1: Address]].” 

Once the restrictions imposed by this Agreement have lapsed with respect to any portion of the Restricted Shares, the book entry for such portion of the Restricted Shares shall be modified to remove the foregoing legend, but not before the Participant has made arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation for tax withholding (as required by Section 5), and the portion of the newly vested shares (if any) that the Participant applies to satisfy his or her tax withholding obligations pursuant to Section 5(b) below shall be transferred to the treasury of the Corporation. 

^**Tax Withholding**.  

Whenever the restrictions applicable to all or a portion of the Restricted Shares lapse under the terms of this Agreement, the Corporation shall notify the Participant of the amount of tax that must be withheld by the Corporation under all applicable federal, state and local tax laws. The Participant agrees to make arrangements with the Corporation to (a) remit the required amount to the Corporation in cash, (b) deliver to the Corporation shares of Common Stock currently held by the Participant (including newly vested shares) with a value equal to the required amount, (c) authorize the deduction of the required amount from the Participant’s compensation, or (d) otherwise provide for payment of the required amount in a manner satisfactory to the Corporation. 

^**Termination of Employment; Change in Corporate Control**. 

If the Participant’s employment with the Corporation is involuntarily terminated for “Cause” (as defined in the Participant’s Employment Agreement) during the term of this Agreement, or if the Participant voluntarily terminates his or her employment with the Corporation (other than after a Change in Corporate Control (as described below) occurring after the date hereof or as provided in Sections 7, 8 or 9 below), including any termination after the term of the Participant’s Employment Agreement expires by reason of the Participant’s election not to extend the term of the Employment Agreement, any Restricted Shares that remain subject to the restrictions imposed by this Agreement shall be forfeited. 

If the Participant’s employment is terminated involuntarily without Cause, including an involuntary termination without Cause as a result of the Corporation’s election not to extend the term of the Participant’s Employment Agreement, or in the event of a Change in Corporate Control, vesting shall be accelerated, the restrictions imposed by this Agreement on the remaining Restricted Shares shall lapse immediately, and no Restricted Shares shall be forfeited. 

For purposes of this Section 6, a “Change in Corporate Control” shall have the meaning set forth in the Participant’s Employment Agreement. To the extent that there is a conflict between the definition set forth in the Participant’s Employment Agreement and the definition set forth in the Plan, the definition of “Change in Corporate Control” set forth in the Participant’s Employment Agreement shall control.

^**Effect of Retirement**.  

If the termination of the Participant’s employment occurs as a result of the Participant’s retirement after age 55 and the sum of the Participant’s age and years of service to the Corporation is equal to 65 or more, vesting shall be accelerated and all of the restrictions imposed on the Restricted Shares by this Agreement shall lapse immediately upon retirement, provided that the Participant delivered to the Corporation, at least six months prior to the date of his or her retirement, written notice specifying such retirement date and the Participant remained in the continuous service of the Corporation from the date such notice was provided until his or her retirement date. Such written notice may not be modified or revoked. The Participant’s retirement under any circumstances other than as specified in the preceding provisions of this Section 9 shall result in the immediate forfeiture of all Restricted Shares that remain subject to the restrictions imposed by this Agreement. 

^**Securities Laws**.

Such conditions may include, without limitation, the partial or complete suspension of the right to transfer the Restricted Shares until the Restricted Shares have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

^**Grant Not to Affect Employment**.  

Neither this Agreement nor the Restricted Shares granted hereunder shall confer upon the Participant any right to continued employment with the Corporation. This Agreement shall not in any way modify or restrict any rights the Corporation may have to terminate such employment under the terms of the Participant’s Employment Agreement with the Corporation. 

^**Miscellaneous**.  

^^This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which taken together will constitute one and the same instrument. 

^^The terms of this Agreement may only be amended, modified or waived by a written agreement executed by both of the parties hereto. 

^^The validity, performance, construction and effect of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law; provided, however, that matters of corporate law, including the issuance of shares of Common Stock, shall be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
