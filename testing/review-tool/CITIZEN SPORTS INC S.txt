*   See Sections 3 and 4 of the Stock Option Agreement.

\centered **CITIZEN SPORTS, INC.** 

\centered **2004 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN** 

\centered **STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT** 

Pursuant to your Stock Option Grant Notice (the “Grant Notice”) and this Stock Option Agreement, Citizen Sports, Inc. has granted you an Option under its 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) to purchase the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock indicated in your Grant Notice (the “Shares”) at the exercise price indicated in your Grant Notice. Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Stock Option Agreement but defined in the Plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan. 

The details of the Option are as follows: 

^**Vesting and Exercisability**. Subject to the limitations contained herein, the Option will vest and become exercisable as provided in your Grant Notice, provided that vesting will cease upon the termination of your employment or service relationship with the Company or a Related Company and the unvested portion of the Option will terminate. 

^**Securities Law Compliance**. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, you may not exercise the Option unless the Shares issuable upon exercise are registered under the Securities Act or, if such Shares are not then so registered, the Company has determined that such exercise and issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The exercise of the Option must also comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Option, and you may not exercise the Option if the Company determines that such exercise would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 

^**Incentive Stock Option Qualification**. If so designated in your Grant Notice, all or a portion of the Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under federal income tax law, but the Company does not represent or guarantee that the Option qualifies as such. 

If the Option has been designated as an Incentive Stock Option and the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the grant date) of the shares of Common Stock subject to the portions of the Option and all other Incentive Stock Options you hold that first become exercisable during any calendar year exceeds $[[USD Value 1: Number]] any excess portion will be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option, unless the Internal Revenue Service changes the rules and regulations governing the $[[USD Value 2: Number]] limit for Incentive Stock Options. A portion of the Option may be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option if certain events cause exercisability of the Option to accelerate. 

^**Notice of Disqualifying Disposition**. To the extent the Option has been designated as an Incentive Stock Option, to obtain certain tax benefits afforded to Incentive Stock Options, you must hold the Shares issued upon the exercise of the Option for two years after the Grant Date and one year after the date of exercise. You may be subject to the alternative minimum tax at the time of exercise. You should obtain tax advice when exercising the Option and prior to the disposition of the Shares. By accepting the Option, you agree to promptly notify the Company if you dispose of any of the Shares within one year from the date you exercise all or part of the Option or within two years from the Grant Date. 

^**Method of Exercise**. You may exercise the Option by giving written notice to the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, which will state your election to exercise the Option and the number of Shares for which you are exercising the Option. The written notice must be accompanied by full payment of the exercise price for the number of Shares you are purchasing. You may make this payment in any combination of the following: (a) by cash; (b) by check acceptable to the Company; (c) if permitted by the Plan Administrator, by using shares of Common Stock you have owned for at least six months; (d) if the Common Stock is registered under the Exchange Act, by instructing a broker to deliver to the Company the total payment required; or (e) by any other method permitted by the Plan Administrator. 

^**Repurchase and First Refusal Rights**. So long as the Common Stock is not registered under the Exchange Act, the Company may, in its sole discretion at the time of exercise, require you to sign a stock purchase agreement, in the form to be provided, pursuant to which you will grant to the Company certain repurchase and/or first refusal rights to purchase the Shares acquired by you upon exercise of the Option. Upon request to the Company, you may review a current form of this agreement prior to exercise of the Option. 

^**Market Standoff**. By exercising the Option you agree that the Shares will be subject to the market standoff restrictions on transfer set forth in the Plan. 

^**Treatment Upon Termination of Employment or Service Relationship**. The unvested portion of the Option will terminate automatically and without further notice immediately upon termination of your employment or service relationship with the Company or a Related Company for any reason (“Termination of Service”). You may exercise the vested portion of the Option as follows: 

^^*General Rule*. You must exercise the vested portion of the Option on or before the earlier of (i) three months after your Termination of Service and (ii) the Option Expiration Date; 

^^*Retirement or Disability*. If your employment or service relationship terminates due to Retirement or Disability, you must exercise the vested portion of the Option on or before the earlier of (i) one year after your Termination of Service and (ii) the Option Expiration Date. 

^^*Death*. If your employment or service relationship terminates due to your death, the vested portion of the Option must be exercised on or before the earlier of (i) one year after your Termination of Service and (ii) the Option Expiration Date. If you die after your Termination of Service but while the Option is still exercisable, the vested portion of the Option may be exercised until the earlier of (x) one year after the date of death and (y) the Option Expiration Date; and 

^^*Cause*. The vested portion of the Option will automatically expire at the time the Company first notifies you of your Termination of Service for Cause, unless the Plan Administrator determines otherwise. If your employment or service relationship is suspended pending an investigation of whether you will be terminated for Cause, all your rights under the Option likewise will be suspended during the period of investigation. If any facts that would constitute termination for Cause are discovered after your Termination of Service, any Option you then hold may be immediately terminated by the Plan Administrator. 

The Option must be exercised within three months after termination of employment for reasons other than death or Disability and one year after termination of employment due to Disability to qualify for the beneficial tax treatment afforded Incentive Stock Options. 

**It is your responsibility to be aware of the date the Option terminates.** 

^**Limited Transferability**. During your lifetime only you can exercise the Option. The Option is not transferable except by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution, except that Nonqualified Stock Options may be transferred to the extent permitted by the Plan Administrator. The Plan provides for exercise of the Option by a beneficiary designated on a Company-approved form or the personal representative of your estate. 

^**Withholding Taxes**.As a condition to the exercise of any portion of an Option, you must make such arrangements as the Company may require for the satisfaction of any federal, state, local or foreign withholding tax obligations that may arise in connection with such exercise. 

^**Option Not an Employment or Service Contract**. Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan will be deemed to constitute an employment contract or confer or be deemed to confer any right for you to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Related Company or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Related Company to terminate your employment or other relationship at any time, with or without Cause. 

^**No Right to Damages**. You will have no right to bring a claim or to receive damages if you are required to exercise the vested portion of the Option within three months (one year in the case of Retirement, Disability or death) of the Termination of Service or if any portion of the Option is cancelled or expires unexercised. The loss of existing or potential profit in Awards will not constitute an element of damages in the event of your Termination of Service for any reason even if the termination is in violation of an obligation of the Company or a Related Company to you. 

^**Binding Effect**. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company and be binding upon you and your heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.

^Payment of Exercise Price 

Prior to or concurrently with the delivery of this Agreement to the Company, Purchaser has delivered the exercise price for the Shares in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the agreement evidencing the applicable Option (the “Option Agreement”). 

^Securities Law Compliance 

^^Purchaser represents and warrants that Purchaser (a) has been furnished with a copy of the Plan and all information which Purchaser deems necessary to evaluate the merits and risks of the purchase of the Shares, (b) has had the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the information received about the Shares and the Company, and (c) has been given the opportunity to obtain any additional information Purchaser deems necessary to verify the accuracy of any information obtained concerning the Shares and the Company. 

^^Purchaser hereby confirms that Purchaser has been informed that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws pursuant to exemptions from registration. Purchaser further confirms that Purchaser understands that the reliance by the Company on such exemptions is predicated in part on the truth and accuracy of the statements by Purchaser in this Agreement. 

^^Purchaser hereby represents and warrants that Purchaser is purchasing the Shares for Purchaser’s own account, for investment purposes only, and not with a view towards the distribution or public offering of all or any part of the Shares. 

^^Purchaser hereby confirms that Purchaser understands that because the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act, Purchaser must continue to bear the economic risk of the investment for an indefinite period of time and the Shares cannot be sold unless the Shares are subsequently registered or an exemption from registration is available. 

^^Purchaser hereby agrees that Purchaser will in no event sell or distribute all or any part of the Shares unless (a) there is an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws covering any such transaction involving the Shares or (b) the Company receives an opinion of Purchaser’s legal counsel (concurred in by legal counsel for the Company) stating that such transaction is exempt from registration or the Company otherwise satisfies itself that such transaction is exempt from registration. 

^^Purchaser hereby consents to the placing of a legend on Purchaser’s certificate(s) as set forth in Section 6 and to the placing of a stop-transfer order on the books of the Company and with any transfer agents against the Shares until the Shares may be legally resold or distributed. 

^^Purchaser hereby confirms that Purchaser understands that at the present time Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) may not be relied on for the resale or distribution of the Shares by Purchaser. Purchaser understands that the Company has no obligation to Purchaser to register the Shares with the SEC and has not represented to Purchaser that it will so register the Shares. 

^^Purchaser confirms that Purchaser has been advised, prior to Purchaser’s purchase of the Shares, that neither the offering of the Shares nor any offering materials have been reviewed by any administrator under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities act (the “Acts”) and that the Shares have not been registered under any of the Acts and therefore cannot be resold unless they are registered under the Acts or unless an exemption from such registration is available. 

^^Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify the Company and hold it harmless from and against any loss, claim or liability, including attorneys’ fees or legal expenses, incurred by the Company as a result of any breach by Purchaser of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty or statement made by Purchaser in this Agreement or the breach by Purchaser of any terms or conditions of this Agreement. 

^Transfer Restrictions 

^^Restrictions on Transfer. Shares will not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, encumbered or otherwise disposed of in contravention of the provisions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the Option Agreement, such restrictions on transfer, however, will not apply to (a) a gratuitous transfer of the Shares, provided, and only if, Purchaser obtains the Company’s prior written consent to such transfer, (b) a transfer of title to the Shares effected pursuant to Purchaser’s will or the laws of intestate succession, or (c) a transfer to the Company in pledge as security for any purchase-money indebtedness incurred by Purchaser in connection with the acquisition of the Shares. 

^^Transferee Obligations. Each person (other than the Company) to whom the Shares are transferred by means of one of the permitted transfers specified in Section 3.1 must, as a condition precedent to the validity of such transfer, acknowledge in writing to the Company that such person is bound by the provisions of this Agreement, to the same extent the Shares would be so subject if retained by Purchaser. 

^^Market Standoff. In connection with any underwritten public offering by the Company of its equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act, including the Company’s initial public offering, Purchaser or any transferee (either being referred to herein as the “Purchaser”) agrees not to sell, make any short sale of, loan, hypothecate, pledge, assign, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose or transfer for value or agree to engage in any of the foregoing transactions with respect to, any Shares without the prior written consent of the Company or its underwriters. Such limitations will be in effect for such period of time as may be requested by the Company or its underwriters; provided, however, that in no event will such period exceed 180 days following the effective date of the registration statement. This market standoff provision will be in effect no longer than two years after the effective date of the Company’s initial public offering. 

^Company’s Right of First Refusal 

Before any Shares held by Purchaser may be sold or otherwise transferred (including any assignment, pledge, encumbrance or other disposition of the Shares, but not including a permitted transfer under Section 3.1), the Company or its assignee will have an assignable right of first refusal to purchase the Shares on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 4 (the “Right of First Refusal”). Such Right of First Refusal shall terminate on the initial registration of the Common Stock under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act. 

^^In the event Purchaser desires to accept a bona fide third-party offer for the sale or transfer of any or all of the Shares, Purchaser will promptly deliver to the Company a written notice (the “Notice”) stating the terms and conditions of any proposed sale or transfer, including (a) Purchaser’s bona fide intention to sell or otherwise transfer such Shares, (b) the name of each proposed purchaser or other transferee (the “Proposed Transferee”), (c) the number of Shares to be transferred to each Proposed Transferee, and (d) the bona fide cash price or other consideration for which Purchaser proposes to transfer the Shares (the “Offered Price”). Purchaser will provide satisfactory proof that the disposition of such shares to such Proposed Transferee would not be in contravention of the provisions of Section 3 and Purchaser will offer to sell the Shares at the Offered Price to the Company. 

^^At any time within 30 days after receipt of the Notice, the Company or its assignee may, by giving written notice to Purchaser, elect to purchase all or any portion of the Shares proposed to be transferred to any one or more of the Proposed Transferees, at the purchase price determined in accordance with Section 4.3. 

^^The purchase price for the Shares purchased under this Section 4 will be the Offered Price. If the Offered Price includes consideration other than cash, the cash equivalent value of the noncash consideration will be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith. 

^^Payment of the purchase price will be made, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator, either (a) in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding indebtedness of Purchaser to the Company or such assignee, or by any combination thereof, within 30 days after receipt of the Notice or (b) in the manner and at the time(s) set forth in the Notice. 

^^If any of the Shares proposed in the Notice to be transferred to a given Proposed Transferee are not purchased by the Company and/or its assignee as provided in this Section 4, then Purchaser may sell or otherwise transfer such Shares to that Proposed Transferee at the Offered Price or at a higher price; provided that such sale or other transfer is consummated within 60 days after the date of the Notice; and provided, further, that any such sale or other transfer is effected in accordance with any applicable securities laws and the Proposed Transferee agrees in writing that the provisions of this Section 4 will continue to apply to the Shares in the hands of such Proposed Transferee. If the Shares described in the Notice are not transferred to the Proposed Transferee within such period, or if Purchaser proposes to change the price or other terms to make them more favorable to the Proposed Transferee, a new Notice will be given to the Company, and the Company or its assignee will again be offered the Right of First Refusal before any Shares held by Purchaser may be sold or otherwise transferred. 

^^Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser may not deliver a Notice and the Company may not exercise the Right of First Refusal earlier than six months and one day following the date of this Agreement (or any shorter period determined by the Company to be sufficient to avoid a charge to the Company’s earnings for financial reporting purposes). 

^Company’s Repurchase Right for Vested Shares 

^^The Company or its assignee will have the right to repurchase the Shares (the “Repurchase Right for Vested Shares”) in the event Purchaser terminates employment with or services to the Company or a Related Company for Cause. Such Repurchase Right for Vested Shares shall terminate upon the Company’s initial public offering of securities in an offering registered under the Securities Act. 

^^The Company may exercise the Repurchase Right for Vested Shares by giving Purchaser written notice within 90 days after the date of Purchaser’s termination of employment with or services to the Company or a Related Company (or exercise of the Option, if later) for Cause. Such notice will indicate the Company’s election to exercise the Repurchase Right for Vested Shares, the number of Shares to be repurchased by the Company and the per-share repurchase price. If the Company fails to give notice within such 90-day period, the Repurchase Right for Vested Shares will terminate unless, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Purchaser and the Company have extended the time for the exercise of the Repurchase Right for Vested Shares. 

^^Payment of the repurchase price will be made, at the option of the Company, either in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding indebtedness of Purchaser to the Company, or by any combination thereof, within 30 days after the Company mails written notice of exercise of the Repurchase Right for Vested Shares. No interest will be paid on such amount. 

^^The repurchase price for the Shares subject to the Repurchase Right for Vested Shares will be equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date the Company mails written notice of exercise of the Repurchase Right for Vested Shares. Purchaser will deliver the certificate(s) representing the Shares subject to the Repurchase Right for Vested Shares, duly endorsed for transfer to the Company, at the same time the Company delivers payment to Purchaser. 

^^Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company may not exercise the Repurchase Right for Vested Shares earlier than six months and one day following the date of this Agreement (or any shorter period determined by the Company to be sufficient to avoid a charge to the Company’s earnings for financial reporting purposes) (the “Holding Period”). To the extent a Holding Period is necessary to avoid such an accounting charge and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the 90-day period specified in Section 5.2 will begin to run on the last day of such Holding Period. 

^Legends 

Purchaser understands and agrees that the Shares are subject to first refusal and/or repurchase rights, as set forth in this Agreement. Purchaser understands that the certificate(s) representing the Shares will bear legends in substantially the following forms: 

*“The securities represented by this certificate are subject to certain restrictions on public resale and transfer and first refusal and repurchase rights held by the issuer and/or its assignee(s) and may not be sold, assigned, transferred, encumbered or in any way disposed of except as set forth in a stock purchase agreement between the issuer and the original purchaser of these shares, a copy of which may be obtained at the principal office of the issuer. Such transfer restrictions and first refusal and/or repurchase rights are binding on transferees of these shares.”* 

*“The securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), or under applicable state securities laws. These securities are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the Act and applicable state securities laws, pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom. Investors should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time. The issuer of these securities may require an opinion of counsel in form and substance satisfactory to the issuer to the effect that the proposed transfer or resale is in compliance with the Act and any applicable state securities laws.”* 

^Stop-Transfer Notices 

Purchaser understands and agrees that, in order to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to in this Agreement, the Company may issue appropriate “stop-transfer” instructions to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the Company transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own records. The Company will not be required to (a) transfer on its books any Shares that have been sold or transferred in violation of the provisions of this Agreement or (b) treat as the owner of the Shares, or otherwise accord voting, dividend or liquidation rights to, any transferee to whom the Shares have been transferred in contravention of this Agreement. 

^Independent Tax Advice 

Purchaser acknowledges that determining the actual tax consequences to each particular Purchaser of exercising the Option or disposing of the Shares may be complicated. These tax consequences will depend, in part, on Purchaser’s specific situation and may also depend on the resolution of currently uncertain tax law, and other variables not within the control of the Company. Purchaser is aware that Purchaser should consult a competent and independent tax advisor for a full understanding of the specific tax consequences to Purchaser prior to exercising the Option or disposing of the Shares. Prior to exercising the Option, Purchaser either has consulted with a competent tax advisor independent of the Company to obtain tax advice concerning the exercise of the Option in light of Purchaser’s specific situation or has had the opportunity to consult with such a tax advisor but chose not to do so. 

^Withholding and Disposition of Shares 

As described in the Option Agreement, Purchaser will make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment of any federal, state, local or foreign withholding tax obligations that arise upon purchase of the Shares. If Purchaser is exercising an Incentive Stock Option, Purchaser agrees to notify the Company if any Shares are disposed of within one year from the date hereof or two years from the Grant Date. 

^General Provisions 

^^Assignment. The Company may assign its first refusal and/or repurchase rights at any time, whether or not such rights are then exercisable, to any person or entity selected by the Company’s Board of Directors, including, without limitation, one or more stockholders of the Company. 

^^Notices. Any notice required in connection with (a) the Company’s first refusal and/or repurchase rights or (b) the disposition of any Shares covered thereby will be given in writing and will be deemed effective upon personal delivery or upon deposit in the U.S. mail, registered or certified, postage prepaid and addressed to the party entitled to such notice at the address indicated in this Agreement or at such other address as such party may designate by 10 days’ advance written notice under this Section 10.2 to all other parties to this Agreement. 

^^No Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be valid unless in writing and signed by the person against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced, nor will failure to enforce any right hereunder constitute a continuing waiver of the same or a waiver of any other right hereunder. 

^^Cancellation of Shares. If the Company or its assignees will make available, at the time and place and in the amount and form provided in this Agreement, the consideration for the Shares to be purchased by the Company pursuant to the exercise of the Company’s first refusal and/or repurchase rights in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, then, from and after such time, the person from whom such Shares are to be repurchased will no longer have any rights as a Purchaser of such Shares (other than the right to receive payment of such consideration in accordance with this Agreement). Such Shares will be deemed purchased in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement and the Company or its assignees will be deemed the owner and Purchaser of such Shares, whether or not the certificates therefor have been delivered as required by this Agreement. 

^^Purchaser Undertaking. Purchaser hereby agrees to take whatever additional action and execute whatever additional documents the Company may deem necessary or advisable in order to carry out or effect one or more of the obligations or restrictions imposed on either Purchaser or the Shares pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement. 

^^Agreement Is Entire Contract. This Agreement constitutes the entire contract between the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan and will in all respects be construed in conformity with the express terms and provisions of the Plan. 

^^Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement will inure to the benefit of, and be binding on, the Company and its successors and assigns and Purchaser and Purchaser’s legal representatives, heirs, legatees, distributees, assigns and transferees by operation of law, whether or not any such person will have become a party to this Agreement and agreed in writing to join herein and be bound by the terms and conditions hereof. 

^^No Employment or Service Contract. Nothing in this Agreement will affect in any manner whatsoever the right or power of the Company, or a Related Company, to terminate Purchaser’s employment or services on behalf of the Company, for any reason, with or without cause. 

^^Stockholder of Record. Purchaser will be recorded as a stockholder of the Company and will have, subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, all the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares. 

^^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but which, upon execution, will constitute one and the same instrument. 

^^Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.
