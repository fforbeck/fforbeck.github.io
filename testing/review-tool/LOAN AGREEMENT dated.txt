The Loan shall be evidenced by notes of Borrower in the form of **Exhibit B**, duly completed and executed by Borrower (one for [[quarter]] Lender in an amount equal to such Lender's Individual Loan Commitment, payable for the account of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office), in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Loan Amount (such notes, as the same may hereafter be amended, modified, extended, severed, assigned, substituted, renewed or restated from time to time (including, without limitation, any substitute notes pursuant to Section 3.05 or 8.06), [[quarter]], a "Note" and collectively, the "Notes"). The Notes shall mature, and all outstanding principal and other sums thereunder shall be paid in full, on the Maturity Date, as the same may be accelerated or extended.

In case of any loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Lender's Note, Borrower shall, upon its receipt of an affidavit of an officer of such Lender as to such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation and an appropriate indemnification, execute and deliver a replacement Note to such Lender in the same principal amount and otherwise of like tenor as the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note.

^**Payments and Distributions**. Borrower shall make [[quarter]] payment under this Agreement and under the Notes not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date when due to Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent's Office or to a bank account directed by Administrative Agent in immediately available funds. Administrative Agent will thereafter, on the day of its receipt of [[quarter]] such payment, cause to be distributed to [[quarter]] Lender such Lender's appropriate share (based upon the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Notes and the respective rates of interest thereunder) of the payments of principal and interest, and its a ppropriate share of the payments of other sums, in like funds for the account of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office. Payments by Borrower hereunder or under the Notes or other Loan Documents shall be made without setoff or counterclaim.

Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement, whenever any payment to be made under this Agreement or under the Notes is due on any day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of the payment of interest and, if applicable, fees, as the case may be.

^**Interest**. Borrower shall pay interest to Administrative Agent for the account of Lenders on the Principal Amount, at a rate per annum as follows: for Base Rate Loans at a rate equal to the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Margin; and for LIBOR Loans at the rate set forth in the definition of "LIBOR Loan" in Section 1.02. Any principal amount not paid when due (when scheduled, at acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest thereafter, payable on demand, at the Default Rate.

Interest (in the case of Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans) shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed in the Interest Period, provided that the first day of the Interest Period shall be included and the last day of said Interest Period shall be excluded. If an advance is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one (1) day's interest shall be paid on such an advance as well as any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.03.

Interest, whether payable on a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Loan, shall be payable monthly in arrears on [[quarter]] Interest Payment Date. Interest at the Default Rate shall be payable on demand.

Any change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be automatically effective as of the day on which such change in rate occurs.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, in no event shall the interest rate on any LIBOR Loan or Base Rate Loan at any time be less than [[Percentage 13: Number]]% per annum regardless of how low the Base Rate or the LIBO Rate may be at the time of any election of any interest rate for the Loan whether or not the Loan is subject to an Interest Rate Protection Agreement.

[[quarter]] determination of an interest rate by Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower in the absence of manifest error.

^**Elections, Conversions and Continuations of Interest Rate**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the provisions of Article III and clauses 2.05(e) and (f) below), Borrower shall have the option to have Principal Amount bear interest as Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans, as follows:

^^Borrower may elect pursuant to a Rate Request to have all or any portion of the Loan be Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans;

^^Borrower may elect pursuant to a Rate Request to convert all or any portion of the outstanding Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans, provided that no such conversion shall be permitted: (i) when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and Administrative Agent has determined that such a conversion is not appropriate; or (ii) after the date which is one (1) month prior to the Maturity Date;

^^Borrower may elect pursuant to a Rate Request to convert all or any portion of the outstanding LIBOR Loans to Base Rate Loans;

^^Any LIBOR Loan may be continued upon the expiration date of its then current Interest Period by Borrower pursuant to a Rate Request, provided that no LIBOR Loan may be continued: (i) when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and Administrative Agent has determined that such a continuation is not appropriate; or (ii) after the date that is one (1) month prior to the Maturity Date;

^^Borrower must elect to have all of the Principal Amount be LIBOR Loans if the Base Rate is lower than the then LIBO Rate for a one, two, three or six month period, so long as LIBOR Loans are available pursuant to the provisions (including Article III) of this Agreement; and

^^If an Interest Rate Protection Agreement is in place with Administrative Agent, the Interest Period selected by Borrower shall be the Interest Period required under said Interest Rate Protection Agreement.

If Borrower fails to submit a Rate Request with respect to the conversion or continuation of an existing LIBOR Loan to Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by 11:00 a.m. New York time three (3) Business Days prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor, the outstanding LIBOR Loan shall, at Administrative Agent's election, automatically continue as a LIBOR Loan with an Interest Period of one (1) month (unless such Interest Period would expire after the Maturity Date, in which case the outstanding LIBOR Loan shall automatically be converted to a Base Rate Loan).

Administrative Agent shall, upon its receipt of [[quarter]] Rate Request from Borrower (and upon its decision to convert or continue a LIBOR Loan pursuant to and in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph), promptly notify [[quarter]] Lender either by telephone or by facsimile of the specified amount thereof and the amount of Lender's portion thereof, the Interest Period and date of commencement thereof, and the applicable interest rate.

[[quarter]] Rate Request shall be applicable to the Notes in accordance with Lenders' respective Pro Rata Shares, so that, barring a conversion or suspension of LIBOR Loans by one or more, but not all, Lenders, pursuant to Article III, the outstanding principal amounts of [[quarter]] of the Notes shall contain segments representing Base Rate Loans and/or LIBOR Loans, [[quarter]] of which segments shall correspond to a proportional segment of the outstanding principal amount of every other Note.

^**Minimum Amounts and Maximum Number of Tranches**. With regard to the Loan as a whole, all elections, conversions and continuations of LIBOR Loans or Base Rate Loans shall be in a minimum amount of $[[USD Value 3]] and in integral multiples of $[[USD Value 4]] Borrower shall not have the right to have more than five (5) distinct Interest Periods, in the aggregate, in respect of the Loan in effect at any one time, including any Interest Periods for outstanding Base Rate Loans at the time.

^**Inapplicability of LIBOR Loans**. Any portion of the Principal Amount that is not bearing interest as, or cannot pursuant to the terms of this Agreement bear interest as, a LIBOR Loan shall bear interest as a Base Rate Loan. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the entire Principal Amount shall, at the option of the Required Lenders, immediately and without notice to Borrower, bear interest as a Base Rate Loan. The foregoing provisions shall not be construed as a waiver by Lenders of their right to pursue any other remedies available to them under the Mortgage or any other Loan Document nor shall they be construed to limit in any way the application of the Default Rate as provided in the Mortgage.

^**Late Payment Premium**. Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent, for the account of Lenders, a late payment premium in the amount of [[Percentage 5]]% of any payments of regular principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable under the Loan Documents (but shall not apply to principal amounts payable at the maturity of the Loan) made more than five (5) days after the due date thereof, which late payment premium shall be due with any such late payment. The late payment premium is to cover administrative and related expenses incurred in handling delinquent payments.

The acceptance of a late payment premium shall not constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default then existing or thereafter arising. Further, Administrative Agent's failure to collect a late payment premium at any time shall not constitute a waiver of Administrative Agent's or Lenders' right thereafter, at any time and from time to time (including, without limitation, upon acceleration of the Notes or upon payment in full of the Loan), to collect such previously uncollected late payment premiums or to collect subsequently accruing late payment premiums.

^**Required Principal Payments**. Upon the Maturity Date, the entire Principal Amount shall be due and payable.

^**Voluntary Prepayments**. Borrower, with thirty (30) days' notice to Administrative Agent, may prepay the Principal Amount, in whole or in part in increments of $[[USD Value 5: Number]] provided that Borrower gives an irrevocable facsimile notice of such prepayment which shall specify: (i) the date of the prepayment; and (ii) in the case of prepayment of LIBOR Loans, the expiration date of the applicable Interest Period; provided Borrower shall have the right to retract any such prepayment by delivering notice at least three (3) Business Days prior to the scheduled prepayment date. Prepayment of the Principal Amount may be made in ac cordance with this Section **provided** that: (i) the required Prepayment Fee is paid; (ii) all accrued and unpaid interest to and including the date of such prepayment on the amount being prepaid is then paid; (iii) any amounts payable pursuant to Article III are then paid; (iv) any breakage costs under an Interest Rate Protection Agreement are then paid; and (v) all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by Administrative Agent or Lenders in connection with the Loan and/or with the prepayment are then paid. Amounts prepaid may not be reborrowed.

^\centered YIELD MAINTENANCE ETC.

^**Additional Costs and Other Effects of Regulatory Changes; Taxes**. Borrower shall pay directly to a Lender, promptly upon demand, such amounts as are necessary to compensate such Lender for Additional Costs resulting from any Regulatory Change occurring after the date hereof which (i) subjects such Lender to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to the Loan or its Note, or changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender under the Loan or its Note (other than taxes imposed on the overall net income of such Lender or of its Applicable Lending Office by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's principal office or such Ap plicable Lending Office is located), (ii) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Lender, (iii) imposes on such Lender or, in the case of LIBOR Loans, on the London interbank market, any other condition affecting the Loan or its Note, or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities or (iv) imposes any capital adequacy requirements on such Lender by virtue of the Loan or the Notes. Such Lender will notify Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent) of any event occurring after the date hereof which would entitle it to compensation pursuant to this paragraph as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation, and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office for those portions of the Loan affected by such event if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in such Lender's sole opinion, be disadvantageous to it, provided that such Lender shall have no obligation to so designate an Applicable Lending Office located in the United States. Administrative Agent and Lenders shall not impose on Borrower any Additional Costs pursuant to this Section unless Administrative Agent and Lenders impose such costs on the other similarly situated borrowers.

Without limiting the effect of the immediately preceding paragraph, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change occurring after the date hereof, (i) a Lender incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of (1) a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender which includes deposits by reference to which the LIBO Rate is determined as provided in this Agreement and/or (2) a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender which includes loans the interest on which is determined on the basis of rates referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" in Section 1.02, (ii) a Lender becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets which it may hold or (iii) it shall be unlawful or impossible for a Lender to make or mai ntain a LIBOR Loan, then such Lender's obligation to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan (and Borrower's right to request the same) shall be suspended and such Lender shall give notice thereof to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent) and, upon the giving of such notice, interest payable on the affected Note shall be converted to the rate for Base Rate Loans, unless such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain its LIBOR Loan (or any portion thereof) to the end of the current Interest Period(s), at which time the interest rate on the affected Note shall convert to the rate for Base Rate Loans. If subsequent to any conversion to Base Rate Loans as provided above such Lender determines that such Regulatory Change has ceased to be in effect, such Lender will so notify Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent), and Borrower may convert the affected Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR Loan by submitting a Rate Request in respect thereof and otherwise complying with the provisions of this Agreement with re spect thereto.

Determinations by [[quarter]] Lender of the existence or effect of any Regulatory Change on its costs of making or maintaining a LIBOR Loan, or on amounts receivable by it in respect thereof, and of the additional amounts required to compensate such Lender in respect of Additional Costs, shall be conclusive, so long as made on a reasonable basis and applicable to all similarly situated borrowers.

^**Limitations on Availability of LIBOR Loans**. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, at the time of or prior to the determination of the LIBO Rate in respect of any LIBO Rate Request Amount as provided in this Agreement, (i) Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive, so long as made on a reasonable basis) that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market generally, adequate and fair means do not or will not exist for determining the LIBO Rate applicable to an Interest Period or (ii) a Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive, so long as made on a reasonable ba sis) that the LIBO Rate will not accurately reflect the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining a LIBOR Loan, then Administrative Agent, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (i) above, or such Lender, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii) above, shall give Borrower prompt notice thereof (with a copy to Administrative Agent in the case of the notice from such Lender), and the LIBO Rate Request Amount in question, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (i) above, or such Lender's portion thereof, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii) above, shall bear interest, or continue to bear interest, as the case may be, as a Base Rate Loan. If at any time subsequent to Administrative Agent's or such Lender's giving of such notice, Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, determines that because of a change in circumstances LIBOR Loans are again available to Borrower, Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall so notify Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent, in the case of the notice from such Lender) and Borrower may convert the Base Rate Loans or the affected Base Rate Loans, as the case may be, to LIBOR Loans by submitting a Rate Request in respect thereof and otherwise complying with the provisions of this Agreement with respect thereto.

^**Certain Compensation**. Borrower shall pay directly to Administrative Agent for the account of a Lender, within five (5) Business Days of request and notwithstanding contrary provisions contained in the Mortgage or other Loan Documents, such amounts as shall, in the judgment of such Lender (which shall be conclusive so long as made on a reasonable basis), compensate it for any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of (i) any failure by Borrower to make a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of a LIBOR Loan after Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with this Agreement (provided that such LIBOR Loa n is available to Borrower under this Agreement), (ii) any failure by Borrower to make any prepayment after Borrower has given notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement subject to Borrower's right pursuant to Section 2.10 to retract an election to prepay, (iii) the making of any payment or prepayment (under any circumstances whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntary) of any LIBOR Loan on a date other than the last day of an applicable Interest Period, (iv) the conversion (for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntary) of a LIBOR Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of an applicable Interest Period, or (v) the early termination of any swap or other interest rate hedging arrangements. In the cases of clauses (i) through (iv) above, such amounts shall include, without limitation, an amount equal to the present value (using as a discount rate the rate at which interest is computed pursuant to clause (y) below) of the excess, if any, of (x ) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, converted, not borrowed, not continued, not converted or not prepaid, as the case may be, for the period from the date of occurrence to the last day of the applicable Interest Period at the applicable rate of interest provided for herein (excluding, however, the LIBOR Margin) over (y) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the London interbank market. In the case of clause (v) above, such amounts shall include, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by the affected Lender, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from reversing any swap or other interest rate hedging arrangements.

^**"Lender" to Include Participants**. For purposes of this Article III and of the definitions of "Additional Costs", "Regulatory Change" and "Reserve Requirements" in Section 1.02, the term "Lender" shall be deemed to include Postbank. For purposes of this Article III and of the definition of "Additional Costs" in Section 1.02, the term "Lender" shall, at [[quarter]] Lender's option, be deemed to include such Lender's present and future Participants in the Loan to the extent of [[quarter]] such Participant's actual Additional Costs or other losses, costs or expenses payable pursuant to this Article III.

^**Substitution of Lenders**. If any Lender (an "Affected Lender") (i) makes demand upon Borrower for (or if Borrower is otherwise required to pay) Additional Costs pursuant to Section 3.01 or (ii) gives notice to Borrower that such Lender is unable to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan as a result of a condition described in clause (ii) of Section 3.02 or in the second paragraph of Section 3.01, Borrower may, within ninety (90) days of receipt of such demand or notice, as the case may be, (A) give written notice (a "Substitution Notice") to Administrative Agent and to [[quarter]] Lender of its intention to replace such Affected Lender with another financi al institution (the "Substitute Lender") designated in such Substitution Notice or (B) prepay the portion of the Loan held by the Affected Lender without a Prepayment Fee or (C) prepay the entire Loan without a Prepayment Fee. Within thirty (30) days of Administrative Agent's receipt of such Substitution Notice, (x) Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and [[quarter]] Lender in writing whether or not the Substitute Lender is satisfactory to the Required Lenders (approval of such Substitute Lender shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (y) the Affected Lender shall notify Borrower and Administrative Agent whether or not it agrees to waive the payment of the Additional Costs in question or the effect of the circumstances described in clause (ii) of Section 3.02 or in the second paragraph of Section 3.01. If (x) the Substitute Lender is satisfactory and (y) the Affected Lender has not agreed to such waiver, then the Affected Lender shall, so long as no Default shall exist, assign its Note and all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to the Substitute Lender, and the Substitute Lender shall assume all of the Affected Lender's rights and obligations, pursuant to an agreement, substantially in the form of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, executed by the Affected Lender and the Substitute Lender. In connection with such assignment and assumption, the Substitute Lender shall pay to the Affected Lender an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount under the Affected Lender's Note plus all interest accrued thereon, plus all other amounts, if any (other than the Additional Costs in question), then due and payable to the Affected Lender with respect to the Loan; **provided**, **however**, that prior to or simultaneously with any such assignment and assumption, Borrower shall have paid to such Affected Lender all amounts properly demanded and un reimbursed under this Article III. Upon the effective date of such assignment and assumption, and the payment by the Substitute Lender to Administrative Agent of a fee, for Administrative Agent's own account, in the amount of $[[USD Value 6: Number]] the Substitute Lender shall become a party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and the Affected Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this Section, a note shall be issued to the Substitute Lender by Borrower, in substitution for the Affected Lender's Note, and the Affected Lender shall return its Note to Borrower. Such substitute note shall constitute a "Note", and the obligations evidenced by such substitute note shall be secured by the Mortgage. In connection with Borrower's execution of such substitute note as aforesaid, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent such evidence of the due authorization, execution and delivery of the substitute note and any related documents as Administrative Agent may reasonably request. If the Substitute Lender is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 7.13.

Upon such resignation or removal of Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent shall (provided there exists no Event of Default) be subject to Borrower's approva l, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

The Required Lenders or the retiring Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent promptly so notify Borrower and the other Lenders. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall t hereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.

^^Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender or Borrower (either one as appropriate being the "Payor") prior to the date on which such Lender is to make payment hereunder to Administrative Agent of Loan proceeds or Borrower is to make payment to Administrative Agent, as the case may be (either such payment being a "Required Payment"), which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor will not make the Required Payment in full to Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made in full to Administrative Agent on such date, and Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may, but shall not be obligated to, in reliance upon such assumption, make the amou nt thereof available to the intended recipient on such date. If and to the extent the Payor shall not have in fact so made the Required Payment in full to Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount made available to it together with interest thereon, for [[quarter]] day from the date such amount was so made available by Administrative Agent until the date Administrative Agent recovers such amount, at the Federal Funds Rate.

^^If, after Administrative Agent has paid [[quarter]] Lender's share of any payment received or applied by Administrative Agent in respect of the Loan, that payment is rescinded or must otherwise be returned or paid over by Administrative Agent, whether pursuant to any bankruptcy or insolvency Law, sharing of payments clause of any loan agreement or otherwise, such Lender shall, at Administrative Agent's request, promptly return its share of such payment or application to Administrative Agent, together with such Lender's proportionate share of any interest or other amount required to be paid by Administrative Agent with respect to such payment or application. In addition, if a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any amount received and distributed by Administrative Agent is to be repaid, [[quarter]] Person to whom any such distribution shall have been made shall either repay to Administrative Agent its share of the amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over the same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be determined by such court.

Administrative Agent and Borrower shall not be obligated to make any payments hereunder to such Lender in respect of the Loan until such Lender shall have furnished to Administrative Agent and Borrower the requested form, certification, statement or document.

^**Sharing of Payments among Lenders**. If a Lender shall obtain payment of any principal of its Note or of interest thereon through the exercise of any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or by any other means (including direct payment), and such payment results in such Lender receiving a greater payment than it would have been entitled to had such payment been paid directly to Administrative Agent for disbursement to Lenders, then such Lender shall promptly purchase for cash from the other Lenders Participations in the Loan in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that al l Lenders shall share ratably the benefit of such payment. To such end Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of Participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.

^**Possession of Documents**. [[quarter]] Lender shall maintain possession of its own Note. Administrative Agent shall hold all other Loan Documents and related documents in its possession and maintain separate records and accounts with respect to the Loan, reflecting the interests of Lenders in the Loan, and shall permit Lenders and their representatives access at all reasonable times to inspect such Loan Documents, related documents, records and accounts.

^**Amendments and Waivers**. No amendment or material waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor consent to any material departure by Borrower or any Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the party against whom such amendment, waiver or consent is sought to be enforced (it being understood, however, that the signature of Administrative Agent, shall be sufficient to bind Lenders to any such amendment, waiver or consent), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; **provided**, **however**, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all Lenders), do any of the following: (i) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees due hereunder or any other amount due hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (ii) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees due hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (iii) change the definition of Required Lenders; (iv) release any material portion of the Mortgaged Property or other collateral for the Loan other than in accordance with the Loan Documents; (v) amend this Section or any other provision requiring the consent of all Lenders; (vi) release, in whole or in part, any Guarantor other than in accordance with the Loan Documents; or (vii) increase the Loan Amount.

All communications from Administrative Agent to Lenders requesting Lenders' determination, consent, approval or disapproval (i) shall be given in the form of a written notice to [[quarter]] Lender, (ii) shall be accompanied by or include a description or copy of the matter or thing as to which such determination, approval, consent or disapproval is requested and (iii) shall include Administrative Agent's recommended course of action or determination in respect thereof.

^**Assignment; Participation**. Any Lender may at any time grant to one or more banks or other institutions not affiliated with Borrower or Guarantor ([[quarter]] a "Participant") participating interests in its Pro Rata Share of the Loan (the "Participations"). In the event of any such grant by a Lender of a Participation to a Participant, such Lender shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and Borrower and Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations hereunder. Any agreement pursuant to which any Lender may grant a Participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of Borrower hereunder and under any other Loan Document, including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; **provided**, **however**, that such participation agreement may provide that such Lender will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver described in clauses (i) through (vii) of Section 8.05 without the consent of the Participant.

[[quarter]] Lender agrees to provide Borrower and Administrative Agent with notice of all Participations sold by such Lender. Borrower agrees to provide all assistance reasonably requested by a Lender to enable such Lender to sell Participations as aforesaid, or make assignments of its interest in the Loan as hereinafter provided in this Section so long as Borrower shall not be required to incur any cost or expense to Lender or Administrative Agent, to increase its liability or Guarantor's liability in doing so, to decrease its rights or otherwise modify the Loan Documents.

^Participant shall only be entitled to the benefits of Section 8.16 if and to the extent that [[quarter]] Lender which sold such participating interest to such Participant concurrently is entitled to make, and does make, a claim on Borrower for such increased costs. Any Lender that sells a participating interest in any Loan under this Section 8.06 shall indemnify and hold harmless Borrower and Administrative Agent from and against any taxes, penalties, interest or other costs or losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred or payable by Borrower or Administrative Agent as a result of the failure of Borrower or Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations to deduct or withhold any taxes from any payments made pursuant to this Agreement to such Lender or Administrative Agent, as th e case may be, which taxes would not have been incurred or payable if such Participant had been a non-U.S. Lender that was entitled to deliver, and did in fact so deliver, a duly completed and valid Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or applicable successor form) entitling such Participant to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal taxes.

^Lender may at any time assign to any bank or other institution not affiliated with Borrower or Guarantor with the consent of Administrative Agent in its sole discretion (such assignee, a "Consented Assignee"), or to one or more banks or other institutions which are majority owned subsidiaries of a Lender or of the parent of a Lender ([[quarter]] Consented Assignee or subsidiary bank or institution, an "Assignee") all or a proportionate part of all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and its Note, and such Assignee shall assume rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement executed by such Assignee and the assigning Lender, provided that, after giving effect to such assignment, in [[quarter]] case, the Assignee's portion of the Loan and, in the case of a partial assignment of a Lender's interest, the ass igning Lender's portion of the Loan will [[quarter]] be equal to or greater than $[[USD Value 9: Number]] Upon (i) execution and delivery of such instrument, (ii) payment by such Assignee to the assigning Lender of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such Lender and such Assignee and (iii) payment by such Assignee to Administrative Agent of a fee, for Administrative Agent's own account, in the amount of $[[USD Value 6]] such Assignee shall be a party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and the assigning Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this paragraph, substitute notes, in the form of **Exhibit B**, shall be issued to the assigning Lender (in the case of a partial assignment) and Assignee by Borrower, in exchange for the return of the assigning Lender's original Note. All such substitute notes shall constitute "Notes" and the obligations evidenced by such substitute notes shall constitute obligations secured by the Mortgage. In connection with Borrower's execution of substitute notes as aforesaid, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent such evidence of the due authorization, execution and delivery of the substitute notes and any related documents as Administrative Agent may reasonably request. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 7.13.

Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall execute such modifications to the Loan Documents as shall, in the reasonable judgment of Administrative Agent, be necessary or desirable in connection with assignments in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section provided that there is no increase in Borrower's obligations or liability, any increase in Guarantor's liability, decrease in Borrower's rights or change in any economic terms.

Any Lender may at any time freely assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note to a Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.

Borrower recognizes that in connection with a Lender's selling of Participations or making of assignments, any or all documentation, financial statements, appraisals and other data, or copies thereof, relevant to Borrower, Guarantor or the Loan may be exhibited to and retained by any such Participant or Assignee or prospective Participant or Assignee. A Lender's delivery of any financial statements and appraisals to any such Participant or Assignee or prospective Participant or Assignee shall be done on a confidential basis.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8.06, PB Capital may enter into an assignment or participation to PB (USA) Realty Corporation or an affiliate controlled by or under common control with PB Capital (none of which assignments or participations shall require the consent of Borrower) provided the requirements of Section 7.13 are satisfied.

^**Setoff**. In addition to (and without limitation of) any right of setoff, bankers' lien or counterclaim Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have, Administrative Agent and [[quarter]] Lender shall be entitled, but only with the prior consent of the Required Lenders, to offset balances (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) held by it for the account of Borrower at any of Administrative Agent's or such Lender's offices against any amount payable by Borrower to Administrative Agent or such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document which is not paid when due (regardless of whether such balances are then due to B orrower), in which case it shall promptly notify Borrower and (in the case of a Lender) Administrative Agent thereof; **provided**, **however**, that Administrative Agent's or such Lender's failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity thereof.

^**Successors and Assigns**. Except as herein provided, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as permitted under the Loan Documents, Borrower may not assign, transfer or set over to another, in whole or in part, all or any part of its benefits, rights, duties and obligations hereunder, including, but not limited to, performance of and compliance with conditions hereof and the right to receive the proceeds of current or future advances.

^**Severability**. The provisions hereof are intended to be severable. Any provisions hereof, or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance, which, for any reason, in whole or in part, is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof (or the remaining portions of such provision) or the application thereof to any other Person or circumstance, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision (or p ortion thereof) or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance in any other jurisdiction.

^**Non-Waiver; Remedies Cumulative**. No failure or delay on Administrative Agent's or any Lender's part in exercising any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents or provided by law (hereinafter in this Section, [[quarter]] a "Remedy") shall operate as a waiver of any such Remedy or shall be deemed to constitute Administrative Agent's or any Lender's acquiescence in any default by Borrower or Guarantor under any of said documents. A waiver by Administrative Agent or any Lender of any Remedy on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any other or future exercise thereof or of any other Remedy. The Remedies are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other Remedies.

^**Certain Waivers**. Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives (i) notice of any actions taken by Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument relating hereto or thereto except to the extent otherwise provided herein or in the other Loan Documents, (ii) all other notices, demands and protests, and all other formalities of every kind in connection with the enforcement of Borrower's obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the omission of or delay in which, but for the provisions of this Section, might constitute grounds for relieving Borrower of any of its obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents except as provided herein or in the other Loan Documents, (iii) any requirement that Administrative Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any lien on any collateral for the Loan or exhaust any right or take any action against Borrower, Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral for the Loan, (iv) any right or claim of right to cause a marshalling of Borrower's assets and (v) all rights of subrogation or contribution, whether arising by contract or operation of law or otherwise by reason of payment by Borrower pursuant hereto or to any other Loan Document. BORROWER FURTHER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY OR ON BEHALF OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR LENDERS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR OTHERWISE IN RESPECT OF THE LOAN, ANY AND EVERY RIGHT BORROWER MAY HAVE TO (W) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OTHER THAN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF GRANTED IN A SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY LENDERS OR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN, INCLUDING THE EXERCISE OF NON-JUDICIAL REMEDIES BY LENDERS OR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, (X) A TRIAL BY JURY, (Y) INTERPOSE ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN, OTHER THAN A COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM, AND (Z) HAVE THE SAME CONSOLIDATED WITH ANY OTHER OR SEPARATE SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL PREVENT OR PROHIBIT BORROWER FROM INSTITUTING OR MAINTAINING A SEPARATE ACTION AGAINST ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR LENDERS WITH RESPECT TO ANY ASSERTED CLAIM.

^**Expenses; Indemnification**. Borrower covenants and agrees to pay all reasonable costs, expenses and charges (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees and charges of engineers, appraisers, Construction Consultant and Lenders' Counsel) incurred by Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with (i) the preparation for and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or for the performance hereof and of the other Loan Documents, and for any services which may be required in addition to those normally and reasonably contemplated hereby unless Borrower or Guarantor raises a successful defense thereto (a successful defense not to include any withdrawal or settlement of any action or to include a defense that is raised in any action in which Lenders are the prevailing party) and (ii) the enforcement hereof or of any or all of the other Loan Documents; **provided**, **however**, that Borrower shall not be responsible for (1) the fees and expenses of legal counsel for Lenders other than PB Capital incurred in connection with said counsel's preparation and review of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents prior to execution and (2) costs, expenses and charges incurred by Administrative Agent and Lenders in connection with the administration or syndication of the Loan (other than the reasonable fees and expenses of Lenders' Counsel).

If Borrower fails to pay promptly any costs, charges or expense required to be paid by it as aforesaid, and Administrative Agent or any Lender pays such costs, charges or expenses, Borrower shall reimburse Administrative Agent or such Lender, as appropriate, on demand for the amounts so paid, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate. Borrower further agrees to indemnify Administrative Agent and [[quarter]] Lender and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from, and hold [[quarter]] of them harmless against, (x) any and all losses arising out of or by reason of any investigation or litigation or other proceedings (including any threatened investigation or litigation or other proceedings) relating to any actual or proposed use by Borrower of the proceeds of the Loan, including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation, litiga tion or other proceedings and (y) any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, costs, expenses, losses, damages and liabilities of any kind, including in tort, penalties and interest, arising out or by reason of any matter relating, directly or indirectly, to the Mortgage or the ownership, condition, development, construction, sale, rental or financing of the Premises or Improvements or any part thereof (but excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred solely by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified). The obligations of Borrower under this Section and under Sections 3.01, 3.03 and 6.07 shall survive the repayment of all amounts due under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents and the termination of the Individual Loan Commitments.

^**Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument, and any party hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.

^**Governing Law; Jurisdiction**. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall in all respects be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to New York's principles of conflicts of law).

^**Integration**. The Loan Documents and the Supplemental Fee Letter constitute the entire agreement among Administrative Agent, Borrower and Lenders relating to the transactions contemplated thereby (except with respect to agreements among Lenders or with Administrative Agent relating solely to compensation, consideration and the syndication of the Loan) and supersede any prior oral or written statements or agreements with respect to such transactions.

^**Gross-Up for Taxes**. All payments made by Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding income taxes and franchise or other taxes (imposed in lieu of or in addition to income taxes) imposed on a Lender as a result of a present or former connection between such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing suc h tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from such Lender's having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or its Note). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to such Lender hereunder or under its Note, the amounts so payable to such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable with respect to the Loan at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement and its Note; **provided**, **however**, that Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to such Lender i f such Lender is not organized under the Laws of the United States or a state thereof and such Lender fails to comply with the requirements of Section 7.13. Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter Borrower shall send to Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender a certified copy of an original official receipt received by Borrower showing payment thereof. If Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by such Lender as a result of any such failure.

\centered **Assignment and Assumption Agreement**

ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT, dated as of ____________, 200__, among [NAME OF ASSIGNING BANK] ("Assignor") and [NAME OF ASSIGNEE] ("Assignee").

\centered **Preliminary Statement**

^This Assignment and Assumption Agreement (this "Agreement") relates to the Loan Agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Loan Agreement") dated as of [[Date 1]] among [[Borrower]] ("Borrower"), the lender(s) party thereto ([[quarter]] a "Lender" and, collectively, "Lenders") and [[Lenders]], as administrative agent ("Administrative Agent"). All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Loan Agreement.

^Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement, Assignor has made an Individual Loan Commitment to Borrower in an aggregate principal amount of $____________ ("Assignor's Loan Commitment").

^The aggregate outstanding principal amount under Assignor's Loan Commitment at the commencement of business on the date hereof is $____________.

^Assignor desires to assign to Assignee all of the rights of Assignor under the Loan Agreement in respect of a portion of Assignor's Loan Commitment and the loan made pursuant thereto, such portion being in an amount equal to $____________ (the "Assigned Loan and Commitment"), of which $____________ is currently outstanding and $____________ is still to be disbursed to Borrower pursuant to the Loan Agreement; and Assignee desires to accept assignment of such rights and assume the corresponding obligations from Assignor on such terms.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

^**Assignment**. Assignor hereby assigns and sells to Assignee all of the rights of Assignor under the Loan Agreement in and to the Assigned Loan and Commitment, and Assignee hereby accepts such assignment from Assignor and assumes all of the obligations of Assignor under the Loan Agreement with respect to the Assigned Loan and Commitment, including, without limitation, Assignor's obligations with respect to the undisbursed portion, if any, thereof. Upon the execution and delivery hereof by Assignor, Assignee, Administrative Agent (and, if applicable, Borrower) and the payment of the amount specified in Section 2 hereof required to be paid on the date hereof, (1) Assignee shall, as of the commencement of business on the date hereof, succeed to the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Agreement with an Individual Loan Commitment in an amount equal to the Assigned Loan and Commitment, and (2) the Individual Loan Commitment of Assignor shall, as of the commencement of business on the date hereof, be reduced correspondingly and Assignor released from its obligations under the Loan Agreement to the extent such obligations have been assumed by Assignee. Assignor represents and warrants that it (x) owns the Assigned Loan and Commitment free and clear of all liens and other encumbrances and (y) is legally authorized to enter into and perform this Agreement. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the assignment provided for herein shall be without representation or warranty by, or recourse to, Assignor.

^**Payments**. As consideration for the assignment and sale contemplated in Section 1 hereof, Assignee shall pay to Assignor on the date hereof, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount under the Assigned Loan and Commitment recited in paragraph 4 of the Preliminary Statement above. [[quarter]] of Assignor and Assignee hereby agrees that if it receives any amount under the Loan Agreement which is for the account of the other party hereto, it shall receive the same for the account of such other party to the extent of such other party's interest therein and shall promptly pay the same to such other party.

^**Consents; Execution and Delivery of Note**. This Agreement is conditioned upon the consent of Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.06 of the Loan Agreement. The execution of this Agreement by Administrative Agent is evidence of this consent; [**Consents not required for certain assignments to entities related to a Lender.**] Pursuant to Section 8.06 of the Loan Agreement, Borrower has agreed to execute and deliver Notes payable to the respective orders of Assignee and Assignor to evidence the assignment and assumption provided for herein.

$____________ New York, New York 

____________, 200__  
For value received, [[Borrower]], a Delaware limited liability company ("Maker") hereby covenants and promises to pay to the order of [NAME OF LENDER] or its successors or assigns (collectively, "Lender"), at the principal office of [[Lenders]] located at 230 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10169 ("Administrative Agent") for the account of the Applicable Lending Office of Lender, the principal sum of _________________________ Dollars ($____________), or if less, the amount loaned by Lender to Maker pursuant to the Loan Agreement (as defined below) and actually outstanding, in lawful money of the United States and in immediately available funds, in accordance with the terms set forth in the Loan Agreement. Maker also covenants and promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance her eof, for the period such balance is outstanding, in like money, at said office for the account of said Applicable Lending Office, at the time and at a rate per annum as provided in the Loan Agreement.

This Note is one of the Notes referred to in the Loan Agreement dated as of the date hereof (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Loan Agreement") among Maker, as Borrower, the lenders named therein (including Lender), as Lenders, and Administrative Agent, as Administrative Agent for Lenders. All of the terms, conditions and provisions of the Loan Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference. All capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Loan Agreement.

This Note is secured by the Mortgage which contains, among other things, provisions for the prepayment of and acceleration of this Note upon the happening of certain stated events. Reference to the Mortgage is hereby made for a description of the "Mortgaged Property" encumbered thereby and the rights of Maker and Lenders (including Lender) with respect to such Mortgaged Property.

Maker agrees that it shall be bound by any agreement extending the time or modifying the terms of payment set forth above and in the Loan Agreement, made by or on behalf of Lenders and the owner or owners of the Mortgaged Property, whether with or without notice to Maker, and Maker shall continue liable to pay the amount due hereunder in accordance with the terms set forth herein and in the Loan Agreement, but with interest at a rate no greater than the rate of interest provided therein, according to the terms of any such agreement of extension or modification.

Should the indebtedness represented by this Note or any part thereof be collected at law or in equity, or in bankruptcy, receivership or any other court proceeding (whether at the trial or appellate level), or should this Note be placed in the hands of attorneys for collection upon default, Maker agrees to pay, in addition to the principal, interest and other sums due and payable hereon, all costs of collecting or attempting to collect this Note, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.

All parties to this Note, whether principal, surety, guarantor or endorser, hereby waive presentment for payment, demand, protest, notice of protest and notice of dishonor.

All notices, requests, demands or other communications with respect to this Note shall be given in the manner set forth in the Loan Agreement.

This Note shall be governed by the Laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to New York's principles of conflicts of law), provided that, as to the maximum lawful rate of interest which may be charged or collected, if the Laws applicable to Lender permit it to charge or collect a higher rate than the Laws of the State of New York, then such Law applicable to Lender shall apply to Lender under this Note.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of Maker under this Note shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required to the extent that receipt of any such payment by Lender would be contrary to provisions of Law applicable to Lender limiting the maximum rate of interest that may be charged or collected by Lender.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Maker has executed and delivered this Note as of the date first above written, intending the same to take effect as a sealed instrument.
