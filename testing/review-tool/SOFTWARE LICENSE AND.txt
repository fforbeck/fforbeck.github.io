^^Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

^^Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereto (including the Original Agreement). 

^^Assignment. This Agreement and any rights or authority granted hereunder shall not be assigned or transferred by either Party, including by operation of law, merger or otherwise, without the express written consent of the other Party, provided that Licensor may assign this Agreement without consent to any of its Affiliates and Licensee may assign this Agreement without consent to an Affiliate that is controlled by Licensee. 

^^Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, both Parties or (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 9.9. 

^^Waiver. Either Party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the other Party or conditions to such Party’s obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any representation, warranty, agreement, condition or obligation granted pursuant to this Section 9.9 or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement shall be construed as 

^^^^^ 
^^waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of such representation, warranty, agreement, condition or obligation or any other representation, warranty, agreement, condition or obligation. The failure of either party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights. 

^^No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the provisions of Article VII relating to indemnified parties, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied (including the provisions of Article VII relating to indemnified parties), is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement. 

^^Governing Law. This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the People’s Republic of China (without regard to its conflicts of laws rules that would mandate the application of the laws of another jurisdiction). 

^^Dispute Resolution. (a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (each, a “Dispute”), shall to the extent possible be settled through friendly consultation among the Parties hereto. The claiming Party (the “Claimant”) shall promptly notify the other Party (the “Respondent”) in a dated written notice that a Dispute has arisen and describe the nature of the Dispute. Any Dispute which remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the “Commission”) to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance with the Commission’s then effective rules (the “Rules”) and this Section 9.12. The language of the arbitration shall be Mandarin Chinese. 

^^The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators. The Claimant shall appoint one (1) arbitrator, the Respondent shall appoint one (1) arbitrator, and the two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall appoint a third arbitrator. If the Claimant and the Respondent fail to appoint one (1) arbitrator, or the two (2) arbitrators appointed fail to appoint the third arbitrator within the time periods set by the then effective Rules, the relevant appointment shall be made promptly by the Commission. 

^^Any award of the arbitration tribunal established pursuant to this Section 9.12 shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties shall use their best efforts to effect the prompt execution of any such award and shall render whatever assistance as may be necessary to this end. The prevailing Party (as determined by the arbitrators) shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred in connection with the arbitration and any judicial enforcement, unless the arbitrators determine that it would be manifestly unfair to honor this agreement of the Parties and determine a different allocation of costs. 

^^^^^ 
^^The foregoing provisions in this Section 9.12 shall not preclude any Party from seeking interim or conservatory remedies, including injunctive relief, from any court having jurisdiction to grant such relief. 

^^No Presumption. The Parties acknowledge that each has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any applicable Law that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the Party that drafted it has no application and is expressly waived. If any claim is made by a Party relating to any conflict, omission or ambiguity in the provisions of this Agreement, no presumption or burden of proof or persuasion will be implied because this Agreement was prepared by or at the request of any Party or its counsel. 

^^Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which a party hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity, it shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking. 

^^Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable for failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement during any period in which such Party cannot perform due to hacker attack, fire, flood or other natural disaster, war, embargo, riot or the intervention of any Governmental Authority, provided, however, that the Party so delayed immediately notifies the other Party of such delay. In no event shall such nonperformance by Licensee be excused due to any such event for longer than ninety (90) days. 

^^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

^^Termination of Original Agreement. Each Party agrees that the Original Agreement is hereby terminated as of the Effective Date and shall be of no further force or effect and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination.
