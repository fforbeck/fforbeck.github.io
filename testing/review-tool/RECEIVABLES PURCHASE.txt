No copies or revisions that change TMCC’s identification as the secured party or the assignee of the secured party can be made without the participation of TMCC.

The Purchaser or the Seller, or the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, shall inform the other party promptly, in writing, upon discovery of any breach of the Seller’s representations and warranties pursuant to this Section which materially and adversely affects the interests of the Purchaser (or any assignee thereof) in any Receivable.

^^Perfection Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The Seller hereby makes the perfection representations, warranties and covenants set forth on Schedule I hereto to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall be deemed to have relied on such representations, warranties and covenants in acquiring the Receivables.

^Repurchase of Receivables. In the event of a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 2.03(a) which materially and adversely affects the interest of the Purchaser (or any assignee thereof) in any Receivable, unless such breach shall have been cured in all material respects, the Seller shall repurchase such Receivable by the last day of the second Collection Period following the Collection Period in which the discovery of the breach is made or notice is received, as the case may be (or, at the option of the Seller, the last day in the first Collection Period following the Collection Period in which such discovery is made or such notice received). This repurchase obligation shall obtain for all representations and warranties of the Seller contained in Section 2.03(a) of this Agreement whether or not the Seller has knowledge of the breach at the time of the breach or at the time the repr esentations and warranties were made. In consideration of the purchase of any such Receivable, the Seller shall remit an amount equal to the Warranty Purchase Payment in respect of such Receivable to the Purchaser. Except as described below, the sole remedy of the Purchaser (or any assignee thereof) with respect to a breach of the Seller’s representations and warranties pursuant to this Agreement shall be to require the Seller to repurchase the related Receivable pursuant to this Section. Upon any such repurchase, the Purchaser shall, without further action, be deemed to transfer, assign, set-over and otherwise convey to the Seller, without recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of the Purchaser in, to and under such repurchased Receivable, all monies due or to become due with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof.

The Purchaser shall cooperate fully with the Seller in connection with the obligations set forth above and will execute any and all documents reasonably required to fulfill the intent of this subsection.

^^Within 30 days after the Seller makes any change in its name, identity or corporate structure which would make any financing statement or continuation statement filed in accordance with paragraph (a) above seriously misleading within the meaning of Section 9-507 of the UCC as in effect in the applicable state, the Seller shall give the Purchaser notice of any such change and shall execute and file such financing statements or amendments as may be necessary to continue the perfection of the Purchaser’s security interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof.

^^The Seller shall notify the Purchaser within 30 days after any relocation of its principal executive office or state of incorporation, if, as a result of such relocation, the applicable provisions of the UCC as in effect in the applicable state would require the filing of any amendment of any previously filed financing or continuation statement or of any new financing statement and shall promptly file such financing statements or amendments

Indication of these respective interests in a Receivable shall be deleted from or modified on the Seller’s computer systems when, and only when, the related Receivable shall have become a Liquidated Receivable or been repurchased.

^No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Purchaser, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Seller, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exhaustive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (and by different parties on separate counterparts), each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

^Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders, each of which shall be considered to be a third-party beneficiary hereof. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no other Person will have any right or obligation hereunder.

^Merger and Integration.

^Indemnification. The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against any and all costs, expenses, losses, claims, damages, injury and liabilities to the extent that such cost, expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arose out of, and was imposed upon such Person through the willful misconduct or negligence of the Seller in the performance of its duties under this Agreement or by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any judgment, award, settlement, reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any actual or threatened action, proceeding or claim; provided, however, that the Seller shall not indemnify any such Person if such acts, omissions or alleged acts or omissions constitute negligence or willful misconduct by the Purchaser. In case any such action is brought against a party indemnified under this Section 5.13 and it notifies the Seller of the commencement thereof, the Seller will assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who may, unless there is, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel stating that there is an unwaivable conflict of interest, be counsel to the Seller), and the Seller will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of investigation.

^Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the Obligations of, the Seller. 

^^The Seller shall not consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or convey or transfer its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless:

^^^the corporation formed by such consolidation or into which the Seller is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer the properties and assets of the Seller substantially as an entirety shall be organized and existing under the laws of the United States or any State or the District of Columbia, and, if the Seller is not the surviving entity, shall expressly assume, by an agreement supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Purchaser, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser, the performance of every covenant and obligation of the Seller hereunder and shall benefit from all the rights granted to the Seller hereunder in all material respects; and

^This Agreement creates a valid and continuing security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the Receivables in favor of the Purchaser, which security interest is prior to all other Liens, and is enforceable as such against creditors of and purchasers from the Seller.

^The Receivables constitute “chattel paper” (including “tangible chattel paper” and “electronic chattel paper”) “accounts,” “instruments” or “general intangibles” within the meaning of the applicable UCC.

^Each Receivable is secured by a first priority validly perfected security interest in the related Financed Vehicle in favor of the Indenture Trustee, as secured party, or all necessary actions with respect to such Receivable have been taken or will be taken to perfect a first priority security interest in the related Financed Vehicle in favor of the Indenture Trustee, as secured party.

\centered **Creation**

^Immediately prior to the sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance of a Receivable by the Seller to the Purchaser, the Seller owned and had good and marketable title to such Receivable free and clear of any Lien and immediately after the sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance of such Receivable to the Purchaser, the Purchaser will have good and marketable title to such Receivable free and clear of any Lien.

^The Seller has received all consents and approvals to the sale of the Receivables hereunder to the Purchaser required by the terms of the Receivables that constitute instruments.

^The Seller has caused or will have caused, within ten days after the effective date of this Agreement, the filing of all appropriate financing statements in the proper filing office in the appropriate jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the security interest in the Receivables granted to the Purchaser hereunder; and the Servicer, in its capacity as custodian, has in its possession the original copies of such instruments or tangible chattel paper that constitute or evidence the Receivables, and all financing statements referred to in this paragraph contain a statement that: “A purchase of or security interest in any collateral described in this financing statement will violate the rights of the Secured Party.”

^With respect to Receivables that constitute instruments or tangible chattel paper, either:

^^^all original executed copies of each such instrument or tangible chattel paper have been delivered to the Indenture Trustee; or

^^^such instruments or tangible chattel paper are in the possession of the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee has received a written acknowledgment from the Servicer that the Servicer (in its capacity as custodian) is holding such instruments or tangible chattel paper solely on behalf and for the benefit of the Indenture Trustee; or

^^^the Servicer received possession of such instruments or tangible chattel paper after the Indenture Trustee received a written acknowledgment from the Servicer that the Servicer is acting solely as agent of the Indenture Trustee.

\centered **Priority**

^The Seller has not authorized the filing of, and is not aware of any financing statements against the Seller that include a description of collateral covering the Receivables other than any financing statement (i) relating to the conveyance of the Receivables by the Seller to the Purchaser under this Agreement, (ii) relating to the conveyance of the Receivables by the Purchaser to the Issuer under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, (iii) relating to the security interest granted to the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture or (iv) that has been terminated.

^The Seller is not aware of any material judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings against the Seller.

^Neither the Seller nor a custodian or vaulting agent thereof holding any Receivable that is electronic chattel paper has communicated an “authoritative copy” (as such term is used in Section 9-105 of the UCC) of any loan agreement that constitutes or evidences such Receivable to any Person other than the Servicer.

^None of the instruments, tangible chattel paper or electronic chattel paper that constitute or evidence the Receivables has any marks or notations indicating that they have been pledged, assigned or otherwise conveyed to any Person other than the Purchaser, the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee.

\centered **Survival of Perfection Representations**
