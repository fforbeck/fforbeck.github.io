The US Revolving Commitment will be reduced by the Dollar Equivalent of the Canadian Credit Exposure and the UK Credit Exposure at any time. 

The Canadian Revolving Commitment is a sub-facility of the US Revolving Commitment and therefore does not increase the total Commitments of the Lenders above the total US Revolving Commitments. 

The UK Revolving Commitment is a sub-facility of the US Revolving Commitment and therefore does not increase the total Commitments of the Lenders above the total US Revolving Commitments.
