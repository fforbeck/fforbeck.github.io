WHEREAS, the Company and HP are parties to that certain Master OEM Agreement of even date herewith (the “**Commercial Agreement**”); and 

WHEREAS, as an inducement for each of the parties to enter into the Commercial Agreement, the parties desire to provide for certain rights as set forth herein; 

NOW THEREFORE, the Company and HP hereby agree as follows: 

^**Notice**.   

^^**Notice of Acquisition Offer**. Each time the Board of Directors of the Company (the **“Board”**) authorizes management of the Company or a committee of the Board to engage in negotiations as a result of the Company’s receipt of a bona fide offer for an Acquisition (as defined below) (an “**Acquisition Offer**”), the Company will provide written notice thereof to HP within five (5) business days after such authorization (the “**Acquisition Offer Notice**”). Each Acquisition Offer Notice shall include a description of the Acquisition Offer and the principal financial and other material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Offer. 

^^**Notice of Acquisition Decision**. Each time (a) the Board decides to investigate a potential Acquisition, or (b) decides to engage an investment bank (or similar adviser) for any such purpose, the Company will provide written notice thereof to HP within five (5) business days after such decision. 

^^**Notice of Stockholder Offer**. Each time Board becomes aware that any person has made an offer to purchase equity securities of the Company that, upon completion, would result in an Acquisition, the Company will provide written notice to HP within five (5) business days thereafter (the “**Stockholder Offer Notice**”). Each Stockholder Offer Notice shall include a description of the proposed Acquisition and the principal financial and other material terms and conditions of the proposed Acquisition. 

^^**Restrictions**.   

1.4.1. The Company shall not enter into any agreement with any person or entity that prohibits the Company from providing any notice required to be provided under this Agreement. 

1.4.2. Until such time as the Company enters into a letter of intent, definitive agreement or similar understanding or agreement with respect to an Acquisition (provided all other terms of this Agreement are adhered to by the Company), the Company shall not enter into any agreement with any person or entity that prohibits the Company from engaging in discussions with HP regarding any potential Acquisition. 

^^**Subsequent Notice**. If HP submits an HP Competing Offer to the Company pursuant to Section 2.1, the Company will provide a new notice to HP (a **“Subsequent Acquisition Offer Notice”**) in the event of each material change in terms of any Acquisition Offer described in an Acquisition Offer Notice (including [[Percentage 1: Number]]% or greater change in price, as determined by the Board in good faith). 

^**Right of Offer**.   

^^**HP Competing Offer**. HP shall have fifteen (15) business days following receipt of any Acquisition Offer Notice, five (5) additional business days following receipt of the first Subsequent Acquisition Offer Notice, and two (2) additional business days following receipt of each additional Subsequent Offer Notice (together, the “**Competing Offer Period**”) to respond with an offer with respect to the transaction contemplated in the Acquisition Offer (the “**HP Competing Offer**”). During the Competing Offer Period, the Company shall afford HP such access to its records and personnel as may be reasonably requested by HP to enable HP to conduct a customary due diligence investigation of the Company in connection with the preparation of an HP Competing Offer.

^^**Board Review**. Upon receipt of an HP Competing Offer, the Board shall review the HP Competing Offer, if any, and each other Acquisition Offer, it being understood that the Board, in its reasonable discretion consistent with its fiduciary duties under law and with the advice of its investment advisors, shall have the right to accept or reject the HP Competing Offer and any or all other Acquisition Offers; provided, however, that in the event that the Board determines to accept an Acquisition Offer other than the HP Competing Offer, the Board shall have determined that such other Acquisition Offer is superior (its terms and conditions taken as a whole) to the HP Competing Offer based upon the exercise of the Board’s fiduciary duties and business judgment. In any such case, the Company shall notify HP of the Board’s decision promptly thereafter.

^^**Restrictions**.   

2.3.1. The Company shall not convene a meeting of the Board or solicit the written consent of the Board to approve the terms of any Acquisition Offer (other than an HP Competing Offer), until the expiration of the Competing Offer Period.

2.3.3. The Company shall not execute any agreement committing the Company to any Acquisition with any party other than HP prior to the expiration of the Competing Offer Period. 

^^**Negotiations with a Third Party**. HP acknowledges and agrees that regardless of whether HP exercises its Right of Offer under Section 2.1 or submits an HP Competing Offer, the Company shall have the right to negotiate with any and all third parties that make an Acquisition Offer. In such event, the other provisions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, Section 1 and this Section 2, shall be applicable. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement with another party to complete an Acquisition, the Company shall provide to HP written notification thereof. 

^**Warrant**. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company is issuing to HP a warrant to purchase the Company’s securities substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto. 

^**Governing Law**. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the internal laws of the State of Delaware.

The acceptance of the New Warrant by the transferee thereof shall be deemed the acceptance by such transferee of all of the rights and obligations of a holder of a Warrant. 

^**Exercise and Duration of Warrants**.   

^^This Warrant shall be exercisable by the registered Holder at any time and from time to time on or after the date hereof to and including the Expiration Date. At 5:00 P.M., [[Address 7: Address]] on the Expiration Date, the portion of this Warrant not exercised prior thereto shall be and become void and of no value.

^^A Holder may exercise this Warrant by delivering to the Company (i) an exercise notice, in the form attached hereto (the “**Exercise Notice**”), appropriately completed and duly signed, and (ii) payment of the Exercise Price for the number of Warrant Shares as to which this Warrant is being exercised (which may take the form of a “cashless exercise” if so indicated in the Exercise Notice and if a “cashless exercise” may occur at such time pursuant to Section 10 below), and the date such items are delivered to the Company (as determined in accordance with the notice provisions hereof) is an “**Exercise Date**.” The Holder shall not be required to deliver the original Warrant in order to effect an exercise hereunder. Execution and delivery of the Exercise Notice shall have the same effect as cancellation of the original Warrant and issuance of a New Warrant evidencing the right to purchase the remaining number of Warrant Shares. 

^**Delivery of Warrant Shares**.  

^^Upon exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall promptly issue or cause to be issued and cause to be delivered to or upon the written order of the Holder and in such name or names as the Holder may designate, a certificate for the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise. The Holder, or any Person so designated by the Holder to receive Warrant Shares, shall be deemed to have become holder of record of such Warrant Shares as of the Exercise Date.

^^This Warrant is exercisable, either in its entirety or, from time to time, for a portion of the number of Warrant Shares. Upon surrender of this Warrant following one or more partial exercises, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued, at its expense, a New Warrant evidencing the right to purchase the remaining number of Warrant Shares. 

^^The Company’s obligations to issue and deliver Warrant Shares in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Company or any violation or alleged violation of law by the Holder or any other Person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of Warrant Shares. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

^**Charges, Taxes and Expenses**. Issuance and delivery of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax, withholding tax, transfer agent fee or other incidental tax or expense in respect of the issuance of such certificates, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the registration of any certificates for Warrant Shares or Warrants in a name other than that of the Holder or an Affiliate thereof. The Holder shall be responsible for all other tax liability that may arise as a result of holding or transferring this Warrant or receiving Warrant Shares upon exercise hereof. 

^**Replacement of Warrant**. If this Warrant is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation hereof, or in lieu of and substitution for this Warrant, a New Warrant, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and customary and reasonable bond or indemnity, if requested. Applicants for a New Warrant under such circumstances shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and procedures and pay such other reasonable third-party costs as the Company may prescribe. 

^**Reservation of Warrant Shares**. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued and otherwise unreserved Common Stock, solely for the purpose of enabling it to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant as herein provided, the number of Warrant Shares which are then issuable and deliverable upon the exercise of this entire Warrant, free from preemptive rights or any other contingent purchase rights of persons other than the Holder (after giving effect to the adjustments and restrictions of Section 9, if any). The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares so issuable and deliverable shall, upon issuance and the payment of the applicable Exercise Price in accordance with the terms hereof, be duly and validly authorized, issued and fully paid and nonassessable. The Company will take all such action as may be necessary to assure that such shares of Common Stock may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Common Stock may be listed. 

^**Certain Adjustments**. The Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant are subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this Section 9. 

^^**Stock Dividends and Splits**. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) pays a stock dividend on its Common Stock or otherwise makes a distribution on any class of capital stock that is payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, or (iii) combines outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, and any adjustment pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. 

^^**Pro Rata Distributions**. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, distributes to holders of Common Stock (i) evidences of its indebtedness, (ii) any security (other than a distribution of Common Stock covered by the preceding paragraph), (iii) rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security, or (iv) any other asset other than cash (in each case, “**Distributed Property**”), then in each such case the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be adjusted (effective on such record date) to equal the product of such Exercise Price times a fraction of which the denominator shall be the average of the Closing Prices for the five Trading Days immediately prior to (but not including) such record date and of which the numerator shall be such average less the then fair market value of the Distributed Property distributed in respect of one outstanding share of Common Stock, as determined by the Company's independent certified public accountants that regularly examine the financial statements of the Company, which shall be definitive, absent manifest error.

^^**Fundamental Transactions**. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person in which the holders of the Company’s securities entitled to vote are not the holders of a majority of the securities entitled to vote in the successor company, (ii) the Company effects any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property, or (iv) the Company effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock covered by Section 9(a) above) (in any such case, a “**Fundamental Transaction**”), then at the closing of such Fundamental Transaction the Holder shall have the right to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant (the “**Alternate Consideration**”). The aggregate Exercise Price for this Warrant will not be affected by any such Fundamental Transaction, but the Company shall apportion such aggregate Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant upon the closing of such Fundamental Transaction.

^^**Number of Warrant Shares**. Simultaneously with any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section, the number of Warrant Shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be increased or decreased proportionately, so that after such adjustment the aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder for the increased or decreased number of Warrant Shares shall be the same as the aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment. 

^^**Calculations**. All calculations under this Section 9 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the Company.

^^**Notice of Adjustments**. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment pursuant to this Section 9, the Company at its expense will promptly compute such adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Warrant and prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, including a statement of the adjusted Exercise Price and adjusted number or type of Warrant Shares or other securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (as applicable), describing the transactions giving rise to such adjustments and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. Upon written request, the Company will promptly deliver a copy of each such certificate to the Holder and to the Company’s Transfer Agent. 

^^**Notice of Corporate Events**. If the Company (i) declares a dividend or any other distribution of cash, securities or other property in respect of its Common Stock, including without limitation any granting of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) authorizes or approves, enters into any agreement contemplating or solicits stockholder approval for any Fundamental Transaction or (iii) authorizes the voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then the Company shall deliver to the Holder a notice describing the material terms and conditions of such transaction, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date on which a Person would need to hold Common Stock in order to participate in or vote with respect to such transaction, and the Company will take all steps reasonably necessary in order to insure that the Holder is given the practical opportunity to exercise this Warrant prior to such time so as to participate in or vote with respect to such transaction; provided, however, that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be described in such notice.

^**Payment of Exercise Price**. The Holder shall pay the Exercise Price in immediately available funds; provided, however, that the Holder may satisfy its obligation to pay the Exercise Price through a “cashless exercise,” in which event the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of Warrant Shares determined as follows: 

^= Y [(A-B)/A]
where:
^= the number of Warrant Shares to be issued to the Holder.

^= the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant is being exercised.

^= the average of the Closing Prices for the five Trading Days immediately prior to (but not including) the Exercise Date.

^= the Exercise Price.

For purposes of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, it is intended, understood and acknowledged that the Warrant Shares issued in a cashless exercise transaction shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Holder, and the holding period for the Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have commenced, on the date this Warrant was originally issued pursuant to the Protective Rights Agreement. 

^**Limitation on Exercise**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the number of shares of Common Stock that may be acquired by the Holder upon any exercise of this Warrant (or otherwise in respect hereof) shall be limited to the extent necessary to insure that, following such exercise (or other issuance), the total number of shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by such Holder and its Affiliates and any other Persons whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with the Holder’s for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the **“Exchange Act”**), does not exceed [[Percentage 3: Number]]% (the “**Maximum Percentage**”) of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (including for such purpose the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise). For such purposes, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Each delivery of an Exercise Notice hereunder will constitute a representation by the Holder that it has evaluated the limitation set forth in this paragraph and determined that issuance of the full number of Warrant Shares requested in such Exercise Notice is permitted under this paragraph. The Company’s obligation to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the limitation referred to in this Section shall be suspended (and shall not terminate or expire notwithstanding any contrary provisions hereof) until such time, if any, as such shares of Common Stock may be issued in compliance with such limitation, but in no event later than the Expiration Date. By written notice to the Company, the Holder may waive the provisions of this Section or increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage specified in such notice, but (i) any such waiver or increase will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company, and (ii) any such waiver or increase or decrease will apply only to the Holder and not to any other holder of Warrants. 

^**Fractional Shares**. The Company shall not be required to issue or cause to be issued fractional Warrant Shares on the exercise of this Warrant. If any fraction of a Warrant Share would, except for the provisions of this Section, be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, the number of Warrant Shares to be issued will be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 

^**Registration Rights**.   

^^If at any time prior to the expiration of the Registration Period (as hereinafter defined in Section 13(d)(i)) the Company proposes to file with the SEC a Registration Statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its securities (other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (or their equivalents at such time) relating to securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option or other employee benefit plans) the Company shall promptly send to each Holder written notice of the Company's intention to file a Registration Statement and of such Holder's rights under this Section 13 and, if within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, such Holder shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in such Registration Statement all or any part of the Registrable Securities such Holder requests to be registered, subject to the priorities set forth below in this Section 13(a). The obligations of the Company under this Section 13(a) may be waived by Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities. If an offering in connection with which a Holder is entitled to registration under this Section 13(a) is an underwritten offering, then each Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in such Registration Statement shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company, offer and sell such Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering using the same underwriter or underwriters and, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on the same terms and conditions as other shares of Common Stock included in such underwritten offering. If a registration pursuant to this Section 13(a) is to be an underwritten public offering and the managing underwriter(s) advise the Company in writing that, in their reasonable good faith opinion, marketing or other factors dictate that a limitation on the number of shares of Common Stock that may be included in the Registration Statement is necessary to facilitate and not adversely affect the proposed offering, then the Company shall include in such registration: (i) first, all securities the Company proposes to sell for its own account, (ii) second, up to the full number of securities proposed to be registered for the account of the holders of securities entitled to inclusion of their securities in the Registration Statement by reason of demand registration rights, and (iii) third, the securities requested to be registered by the Holders and other holders of securities entitled to participate in the registration, as of the date hereof, drawn from them pro rata based on the number each has requested to be included in such registration. 

^^The initial number of Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement and each increase in the number of Registrable Securities included therein shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number of Registrable Securities held by each Holder at the time the Registration Statement covering such initial number of Registrable Securities or increase thereof is declared effective by the SEC. In the event that a Holder sells or otherwise transfers any of such Person's Registrable Securities, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the then remaining number of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement for such transferor. Any shares of Common Stock included in a Registration Statement and which remain allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Registrable Securities shall be allocated to the remaining Holders, pro rata based on the number of Registrable Securities then held by such Holders. 

^^Subject to Section 13(f) hereof, the Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities shall have the right to select one legal counsel to review and oversee any offering pursuant to this Section 13 (**“Legal Counsel”**), which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. 

^^Whenever a Holder has requested that any Registrable Securities be registered pursuant to Section 13(a) the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof and, pursuant thereto, the Company shall have the following obligations: 

^^^The Company shall keep such Registration Statement effective pursuant to Rule 415 at all times until the earlier of (A) the date as of which the Holders may sell all of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or successor thereto) or (B) the date on which the Holders shall have sold all the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement (the “**Registration Period”**).

^^^The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to a Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection with such Registration Statement, which prospectus is to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated under the Securities Act, as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective at all times during the Registration Period, and, during such period, comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities of the Company covered by such Registration Statement until such time as all of such Registrable Securities shall have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof as set forth in such Registration Statement. In the case of amendments and supplements to a Registration Statement that are required to be filed pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to this Section 13(d)(ii)) by reason of the Company filing a report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K or any analogous report under the Exchange Act, the Company shall file such amendments or supplements with the SEC on the same day on which the Exchange Act report is filed which created the requirement for the Company to amend or supplement the Registration Statement.

^^^The Company shall (A) permit Legal Counsel to review and comment upon a Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements to all Registration Statements within a reasonable number of days prior to the their filing with the SEC and (B) not file any document in a form to which Legal Counsel reasonably objects. The Company shall not submit a request for acceleration of the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto without the prior approval of Legal Counsel, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company shall furnish to Legal Counsel, without charge, (A) any correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the Company or its representatives relating to any Registration Statement, (B) promptly after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC, one copy of any Registration Statement and any amendment(s) thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits and (C) upon the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, one copy of the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto. 

^^^The Company shall furnish to each Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in any Registration Statement, without charge, (A) promptly after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC, at least one copy of such Registration Statement and any amendment(s) thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference, all exhibits and each preliminary Prospectus, (B) upon the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, ten (10) copies of the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto (or such other number of copies as such Holder may reasonably request) and (C) such other documents, including copies of any preliminary or final Prospectus, as such Holder may reasonably request from time to time in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder. 

^^^The Company shall use reasonable efforts to (A) register and qualify the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as Legal Counsel or any Holder reasonably requests, (B) prepare and file in those jurisdictions, such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to such registrations and qualifications as may be necessary to maintain the effectiveness thereof during the Registration Period, (C) take such other actions as may be necessary to maintain such registrations and qualifications in effect at all times during the Registration Period, and (D) take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to qualify the Registrable Securities for sale in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to (x) qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 13(d)(v), (y) subject itself to general taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (z) file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction. The Company shall promptly notify Legal Counsel and each Holder who holds Registrable Securities of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the registration or qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction in the United States or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. 

^^^In the event Holders who hold a majority of the Registrable Securities being offered in the offering select underwriters for the offering, the Company shall enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, including, without limitation, customary indemnification and contribution obligations, with the underwriters of such offering; provided, however, that the Company shall have the right to consent to the selection of such underwriter, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

^^^As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, the Company shall notify Legal Counsel and each Holder in writing of the happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement to correct such untrue statement or omission, and deliver ten (10) copies of such supplement or amendment to Legal Counsel and each Holder (or such other number of copies as Legal Counsel or such Holder may reasonably request). The Company shall also promptly notify Legal Counsel and each Holder in writing (A) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and when a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment has become effective (notification of such effectiveness shall be delivered to Legal Counsel and each Holder by facsimile on the same day of such effectiveness and by overnight mail), (B) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or related prospectus or related information, and (C) of the Company's reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate.

^^^The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or the suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an order or suspension is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of such order or suspension at the earliest possible moment and to notify Legal Counsel and each Holder who holds Registrable Securities being sold (and, in the event of an underwritten offering, the managing underwriters) of the issuance of such order and the resolution thereof or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose. 

^^^At the request of any Holder, the Company shall furnish to such Holder, on the date of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and thereafter from time to time on such dates as a Holder may reasonably request (A) if required by an underwriter, a letter, dated such date, from the Company's independent certified public accountants in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, and (B) an opinion, dated as of such date, of counsel representing the Company for purposes of such Registration Statement, in form, scope and substance as is customarily given in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters and the Holders. 

^^^The Company shall make available for inspection by (A) any Holder, (B) Legal Counsel, (C) any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to a Registration Statement, (D) one firm of accountants or other agents retained by the Holders and (E) one firm of attorneys retained by such underwriters (collectively, the "**Inspectors**") all pertinent financial and other records, and pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company (collectively, the "**Records**"), as shall be reasonably deemed necessary by each Holder, and cause the Company's officers, directors and employees to supply all information that any Inspector may reasonably request; provided, however, that each Inspector shall hold in strict confidence and shall not make any disclosure (except to a Holder) or use of any Record or other information which the Company determines in good faith to be confidential, and of which determination the Inspectors are so notified, unless (i) the disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in any Registration Statement or is otherwise required under the Securities Act, (ii) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a final, non-appealable subpoena or order from a court or government body of competent jurisdiction, or (iii) the information in such Records has been made generally available to the public other than by disclosure in violation of this or any other agreement of which the Inspector has knowledge. Each Holder agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in or by a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt notice to the Company and allow the Company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain a protective order for, the Records deemed confidential. 

^^^The Company shall hold in confidence and not make any disclosure of information concerning a Holder provided to the Company unless (A) disclosure of such information is necessary to comply with federal or state securities laws, (B) the disclosure of such information is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in any Registration Statement, (C) the release of such information is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other final, non-appealable order from a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction, or (iv) such information has been made generally available to the public other than by disclosure in violation of this Agreement or any other agreement. The Company agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such information concerning a Holder is sought in or by a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt written notice to such Holder and allow such Holder, at the Holder's expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain a protective order for, such information. 

^^^The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts either to (A) cause all the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which securities of the same class or series issued by the Company are then listed, if any, if the listing of such Registrable Securities is then permitted under the rules of such exchange, or (B) secure the inclusion for quotation on the over-the-counter market on the OTC Bulletin Board for such Registrable Securities and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to arrange for at least two market makers to register with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (**“FINRA”**) as such with respect to such Registrable Securities. The Company shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with satisfying its obligation under this Section 13(d)(xii). 

^^^The Company shall cooperate with the Holders who hold Registrable Securities being offered and, to the extent applicable, any managing underwriter or underwriters, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not bearing any restrictive legend) representing the Registrable Securities to be offered pursuant to a Registration Statement and enable such certificates to be in such denominations or amounts, as the case may be, as the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or, if there is no managing underwriter or underwriters, the Holders may reasonably request and registered in such names as the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or the Holders may request. 

^^^The Company shall provide a Transfer Agent of all such Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of such Registration Statement.

^^^If requested by the managing underwriters or a Holder, the Company shall (A) promptly incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the managing underwriters and the Holders agree should be included therein relating to the sale and distribution of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the number of Registrable Securities being sold to such underwriters, the purchase price being paid therefor by such underwriters and any other terms of the underwritten (or best efforts underwritten) offering of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering; (B) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; and (C) supplement or make amendments to any Registration Statement if requested by a Holder or any underwriter of such Registrable Securities. 

^^^The Company shall make generally available to its security holders as soon as practical, but not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the Securities Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the effective date of the Registration Statement. 

^^^The Company shall otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC in connection with any registration hereunder. 

^^^Within two (2) Business Days after a Registration Statement which covers applicable Registrable Securities is ordered effective by the SEC, the Company shall deliver, and shall cause legal counsel for the Company to deliver, to the Transfer Agent for such Registrable Securities (with copies to the Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in such Registration Statement) confirmation that such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC. 

^^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 13(d)(vii), at any time after the Registration Statement has been declared effective, the Company may delay the disclosure of material, non-public information concerning the Company the disclosure of which at the time is not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company and its counsel, in the best interest of the Company and, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, otherwise required (a **"**Grace Period****"**); provided, that the Company shall promptly (A) notify the Holders in writing of the existence of material, non-public information giving rise to a Grace Period and the date on which the Grace Period will begin, and (B) notify the Holders in writing of the date on which the Grace Period ends; and, provided further, that during any consecutive 365 day period, there shall be only three Grace Periods, each such Grace Period not to exceed 20 days each (an **"****Allowable Grace Period**"**). For purposes of determining the length of a Grace Period above, the Grace Period shall begin on and include the date the Holders receive the notice referred to in clause (A) above and shall end on and include the date the Holders receive the notice referred to in clause (B) above. Upon expiration of an Allowable Grace Period, the Company shall again be bound by the first sentence of Section 13(d)(vii) with respect to the information giving rise thereto.

^^The Holders shall have the following obligations with respect to each Registration Statement: 

^^^At least seven (7) Business Days prior to the first anticipated filing date of a Registration Statement, the Company shall notify each Holder in writing of the information the Company requires from each such Holder if such Holder elects to have any of such Holder's Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to complete the registration pursuant to this Warrant with respect to the Registrable Securities of a particular Holder that such Holder shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it and the intended method of disposition of the Registrable Securities held by it as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of such Registrable Securities and shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as the Company may reasonably request. 

^^^Each Holder by such Holder's acceptance of the Registrable Securities agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of any Registration Statement hereunder, unless such Holder has notified the Company in writing of such Holder's election to exclude all of such Holder's Registrable Securities from such Registration Statement. 

^^^In the event any Holder elects to participate in an underwritten public offering pursuant to Section 13(a), each such Holder agrees to enter into and perform such Holder's obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, including, without limitation, customary indemnification and contribution obligations, with the managing underwriter of such offering and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities. 

^^^Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 13(d)(viii) or the first sentence of Section 13(d)(vii), such Holder will immediately discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement(s) covering such Registrable Securities until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 13(d)(viii) or the first sentence of 13(d)(vii). 

^^^No Holder may participate in any underwritten Registration hereunder unless such Holder (A) agrees to sell such Holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Holders entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements, (B) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements, and (C) agrees to pay its pro rata share of all underwriting discounts and commissions. 

^^^Each Holder agrees not to take any action to cause such Holder to become a registered broker dealer as defined under the 1934 Act or to effect any change to such Holder's status that would preclude the Company from using Form S-3 for the Registration Statement. 

^^All reasonable expenses, other than expenses incurred pursuant to Section 13(d)(x)(D) and (E) and underwriting discounts and commissions, incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to this Sections 13, including, without limitation, all registration, listing and qualifications fees, printers and accounting fees, and fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and reasonable fees and disbursements of Legal Counsel, shall be paid by the Company.

^^In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement under this Agreement: 

^^^To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company will, and hereby does, indemnify, hold harmless and defend each Holder who holds such Registrable Securities, the directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, representatives of, and each Person, if any, who controls any Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for the Holders, and the directors and officers of, and each Person, if any, who controls, any such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the 1934 Act (each, an "**Indemnified Person**"), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, charges, costs, attorneys' fees, amounts paid in settlement or expenses, joint or several, (collectively, "**Claims**") incurred in investigating, preparing or defending any action, claim, suit, inquiry, proceeding, investigation or appeal taken from the foregoing by or before any court or governmental, administrative or other regulatory agency or body or the SEC, whether pending or threatened, whether or not an indemnified party is or may be a party thereto ("**Indemnified Damages**"), to which any of them may become subject insofar as such Claims (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (A) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto or in any filing made in connection with the qualification of the offering under the securities or other "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction in which Registrable Securities are offered ("**Blue Sky Filing**"), or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (B) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus if used prior to the effective date of such Registration Statement, or contained in the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if the Company files any amendment thereof or supplement thereto with the SEC) or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading, (C) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any other law, including, without limitation, any state securities law, or any rule or regulation thereunder relating to the offer or sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement or (D) any material violation of this Agreement (the matters in the foregoing clauses (A) through (D) being, collectively, "**Violations**"). The Company shall reimburse the Holders and each such underwriter or controlling Person, promptly as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 13(g): (A) shall not apply to a Claim by an Indemnified Person arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such Indemnified Person or underwriter for such Indemnified Person expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto, if such Prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 13(d)(iv); (B) with respect to any preliminary Prospectus, shall not inure to the benefit of any such person from whom the person asserting any such Claim purchased the Registrable Securities that are the subject thereof (or to the benefit of any person controlling such Person) if the untrue statement or omission of material fact contained in the preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 13(d)(iv), and the Indemnified Person was promptly advised in writing not to use the incorrect prospectus prior to the use giving rise to a violation and such Indemnified Person, notwithstanding such advice, used it; (C) shall not be available to the extent such Claim is based on a failure of the Holder to deliver or to cause to be delivered the Prospectus made available by the Company, if such Prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 13(d)(iv); and (D) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Holders pursuant to Section 13(j). 

^^^In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder is participating, each such Holder agrees to severally and not jointly indemnify, hold harmless and defend, to the same extent and in the same manner as is set forth in Section 13(g)(i), the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each, an "**Indemnified Party**"), against any Claim or Indemnified Damages to which any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claim or Indemnified Damages arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Holder expressly for use in connection with such Registration Statement; and, subject to Section 13(g)(iv), such Holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 13(g)(ii) and the agreement with respect to contribution contained in Section 13(h) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of such Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, further, however, that the Holder shall be liable under this Section 13(g)(ii) for only that amount of a Claim or Indemnified Damages as does not exceed the net proceeds to such Holder as a result of the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Holders pursuant to Section 13(j). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 13(g)(ii) with respect to any preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Party if the untrue statement or omission of material fact contained in the preliminary Prospectus was corrected on a timely basis in the Prospectus and such Prospectus was provided to Holders as required, as then amended or supplemented. 

^^^The Company shall be entitled to receive indemnities from underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals participating in any distribution, to the same extent as provided above, with respect to information such persons so furnished in writing expressly for inclusion in the Registration Statement. 

^^^Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 13(g) of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving a Claim, such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 13(g), deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be; provided, however, that an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel retained by the indemnifying party, the representation by such counsel of the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The Company shall pay reasonable fees for only one separate legal counsel for the Holders, and such legal counsel shall be selected by the Holders holding a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement to which the Claim relates. The Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or claim by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person which relates to such action or claim. The indemnifying party shall keep the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its written consent; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 13(g), except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action. 

^^^The indemnification required by this Section 13(g) shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or Indemnified Damages are incurred. 

^^^The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (A) any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person against the indemnifying party or others, and (B) any liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law. 

^^To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under Section 13(g) to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that: (i) no seller of Registrable Securities guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any seller of Registrable Securities who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation; and (ii) contribution by any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities. 

^^^With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or any other similar rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit the Holders to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration ("**Rule 144**"), the Company agrees to: 

^^^make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144; 

^^^file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act so long as the Company remains subject to such requirements until the Holders may sell all Registrable Securities without restriction under Rule 144, and the filing of such reports and other documents is required for the applicable provisions of Rule 144; and 

^^^furnish to each Holder so long as such Holder owns Registrable Securities, promptly upon request, (A) a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (B) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company, and (C) such other information as may be reasonably requested to permit the Holders to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without registration. 

^^The rights under this Agreement shall be automatically assignable by the Holders to any transferee of all or any portion of Registrable Securities if: (A) the Holder agrees in writing with the transferee or assignee to assign such rights, and a copy of such agreement is furnished to the Company within a reasonable time after such assignment; (B) the Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer or assignment, furnished with written notice of (i) the name and address of such transferee or assignee, and (ii) the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned; (C) immediately following such transfer or assignment the further disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is restricted under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws; (D) at or before the time the Company receives the written notice contemplated by clause (E) of this sentence the transferee or assignee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of the provisions contained herein.

^**Notices**. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries hereunder (including without limitation any Exercise Notice) shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (i) the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile at the facsimile number specified as provided in this Section prior to 5:00 p.m. ([[Address 7: Address]]) on a Trading Day, (ii) the next Trading Day after the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile at the facsimile number specified as provided in this Section on a day that is not a Trading Day or later than 5:00 p.m. ([[Address 7: Address]]) on any Trading Day, (iii) the Trading Day following the date of mailing, if sent by nationally recognized overnight courier service, or (iv) upon actual receipt by the party to whom such notice is required to be given. The address for such notices or communications shall be as set forth in the Protective Rights Agreement. 

^**Warrant Agent**. The Company shall serve as warrant agent under this Warrant. Upon 30 days' notice to the Holder, the Company may appoint a new warrant agent. Any corporation into which the Company or any new warrant agent may be merged or any corporation resulting from any consolidation to which the Company or any new warrant agent shall be a party or any corporation to which the Company or any new warrant agent transfers substantially all of its corporate trust or stockholders services business shall be a successor warrant agent under this Warrant without any further act. Any such successor warrant agent shall promptly cause notice of its succession as warrant agent to be mailed (by first class mail, postage prepaid) to the Holder at the Holder's last address as shown on the Warrant Register. 

^**Miscellaneous**.   

^^Subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth on the first page hereof, this Warrant may be assigned by the Holder. This Warrant may not be assigned by the Company except to a successor in the event of a Fundamental Transaction. This Warrant shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Subject to the preceding sentence, nothing in this Warrant shall be construed to give to any Person other than the Company and the Holder any legal or equitable right, remedy or cause of action under this Warrant. This Warrant may be amended only in writing signed by the Company and the Holder and their successors and assigns.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company (i) will not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above the amount payable therefor on such exercise, (ii) will take all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares on the exercise of this Warrant, and (iii) will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which interferes with the timely exercise of this Warrant.
