\centered **ZipRealty Inc. Management Incentive Plan  Fiscal Year 2010** 

General Purpose: This ZipRealty Inc. (“Company”) Management Incentive Plan  Fiscal Year 2010 (“Plan”) is designed to motivate and retain the Company’s Management (as defined herein) to achieve the Company’s financial and operational goals for Fiscal Year 2010, as well as to retain such persons in the employ of the Company. Management as used in this Plan includes all employees of the Company holding the position of Vice President or higher. “Management” specifically excludes all District Directors, Sales Management, as defined in the Sales Management 2010 Incentive Plan, and other employees not specifically identified in this paragraph. 

Duration: This Plan will be in effect for the Company’s fiscal year ending [[Date 1: Date]] (“Fiscal Year 2010”) except as set forth below, meaning that the performance period determining whether bonuses will be paid upon satisfaction of performance objectives is Fiscal Year 2010 or the first half of Fiscal Year 2010 as set forth below (though some such payments, if earned, will be made following the end of this Fiscal Year as set forth below). 

Plan Administrator: The Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) shall administer this Plan with respect to “Eligible Persons” (as defined below) who are executive officers of the Company, and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, in consultation with the Committee, shall administer this Plan with respect to other Eligible Persons (as applicable, the “Administrator”). 

Eligible Persons: Individuals eligible to earn an incentive payment under this plan (“Eligible Persons”) include Management who are employed by the Company during the applicable Performance Period (Mid Year or Annual), without interruption (except as set forth in the “Proration” section of this Plan), and (ii) on the date following completion of the Performance Period when the Administrator completes its review of performance, calculates and approves the payment of bonuses under this Plan. 

Proration: In the sole discretion of the Administrator, a prorated incentive may be paid under this Plan for any member of Management who became eligible to participate in the Plan after the beginning of Fiscal Year 2010, or who was away from work for some portion of fiscal year 2010 due to an approved leave of absence. Additionally, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, a modified incentive amount may be paid under this Plan to any Eligible Person who works a reduced work schedule.

Incentive Pool: 

The Committee, in consultation with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer will establish an incentive pool of funds available for payout if the Company achieves at least break-even Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of this Plan “Adjusted EBITDA” shall be defined as net income (loss) less interest income plus interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation and further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing core operating performance. 

Incentive Amount: Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, Eligible Persons may earn payment of “Incentive Amounts” determined as a percentage of annual base salary upon completion of the applicable performance period ([[Date 2: Date]] or [[Date 1]]) (“Base Salary”). 

The Incentive Amounts will be determined as follows: 

Eligible Persons may earn two incentives pursuant to this Plan, the first “Mid-Year Incentive” based on “Company Performance” (as defined below) and certain other business and performance metrics through [[Date 2]] and the second “Annual Incentive” based on Company Performance and certain other business and performance metrics for the full fiscal year 2010. No incentive under this Plan shall be earned unless the Company achieves at least break-even Adjusted EBITDA. In the event that the Company does not achieve break-even Adjusted EBITDA upon completion of the Mid Year performance period, but does achieve break-even Adjusted EBITDA upon completion of the Annual Performance Period, Eligible Persons may earn the Mid Year incentive upon completion of the full year 2010 based on achievement of all other conditions for payment of a Mid Year incentive. Each of these Incentive Amounts shall be calculated as follows: 

\centered **Mid Year Incentive** 

The Mid Year Incentive shall include the “Base Incentive” (defined below) and if applicable, additional incentives or multipliers set forth below and shall total [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of each Eligible Person’s incentive opportunity for fiscal year 2010. 

The Mid Year “Base Incentive” shall be measured based on Mid Year “Company Performance”, which for purposes of the Mid Year Incentive shall be defined as a measurement of the Company’s achievement of revenue at Performance Targets as set forth below. Company Performance for the Mid Year Incentive shall be measured against Mid Year Performance Targets. 

Base Incentive Calculation: 

The Committee shall set forth Mid Year Performance Targets at “Minimum” “Target” and “Stretch” levels for revenue, based on Company Performance from [[Date 3: Date]] through [[Date 2]], in its sole discretion, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer. The Committee may also, in its sole discretion set forth any conditions that it deems appropriate, required for an incentive to be earned at each Target. Further, the Committee may, at any time, in its sole discretion modify any Performance Target(s) taking into account various factors, including but not limited to, general business and market conditions. 

Total possible Mid Year Incentive Amounts for Eligible Persons shall be as follows: 

**Position**      **Minimum**         **Target**         **Stretch**
CEO       %       %       %
CFO and SVP Sales       %       %       %
Executive Officer and CEO Direct Report Vice Presidents       %       %       %
NonExecutive Officer Vice Presidents       %       %       %

Incentives for Company Performance falling between the Performance Targets for each applicable metric shall be determined pursuant to a calculation approved by the Committee. 

Multipliers: 

The Base Incentive for Eligible Persons may be adjusted by application of multipliers based on the Company’s performance against Mid Year financial and operational metrics as set forth by the Committee. Each multiplier shall potentially increase the Base Incentive amount if the Company meets or exceeds the specified metric and shall potentially decrease the Base Incentive amount if the Company fails to achieve the specified metric. The ranges for these multipliers shall be as follows: 

Multiplier 1: From .85 to 1.10 multiplied against the Base Incentive amount 

Multiplier 2: From .90 to 1.05 multiplied against the Base Incentive amount 

Multiplier 3: From .90 to 1.05 multiplied against the Base Incentive amount 

Collectively, these multipliers may increase the Base Incentive amount by up to [[Percentage 2: Number]]% or decrease the Base Incentive amount by up to .[[Percentage 3: Number]]%. The Committee may, in its sole discretion modify ranges for each multiplier taking into account various factors, including but not limited to, general business and market conditions. 

Individual Performance Incentive: 

In the event that the Committee establishes an incentive pool for payment of the Mid Year Incentive, the Committee may also establish a pool for payment of an additional incentive amount based on each Eligible Person’s performance in relation to his or her Individual Goals and Objectives for the first half of fiscal year 2010. The Committee shall determine in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, which Eligible Persons if any, shall be entitled to such additional incentive and the amount of any applicable incentive. The Individual Performance Incentive amount shall be added to the Mid Year Incentive after the multipliers set forth above are applied to the Base Incentive. The multipliers shall not apply to the Individual Performance Incentive amount. 

\centered **Annual Incentive** 

The Annual Incentive shall include the “Base Incentive” (defined below) and if applicable, additional incentives or multipliers set forth below and shall total [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of each Eligible Person’s incentive opportunity for fiscal year 2010. 

The Annual “Base Incentive” shall be measured based on Annual “Company Performance”, which for purposes of the Annual Incentive shall be defined as a measurement consisting of the following two metrics 1) the Company’s achievement of revenue Performance Targets (defined below), which shall make up [[Percentage 5: Number]]% of the Base Incentive; and 2) the Company’s achievement of Adjusted EBITDA Performance Targets, which shall make up [[Percentage 5]]% of the Base Incentive. Company Performance for the Annual Incentive shall be measured against full year Performance Targets. 

Base Incentive Calculation: 

The Committee shall set forth Annual Performance Targets at “Minimum” “Target” and “Stretch” levels for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in its sole discretion, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer. The Committee may also, in its sole discretion set 

forth any conditions that it deems appropriate, required for an incentive to be earned at each Target. Further, the Committee may, at any time, in its sole discretion modify any Performance Target(s) taking into account various factors, including but not limited to, general business and market conditions. 

Total Possible Annual Base Incentive Amounts for Eligible Person shall be as follows: 

**Position**      **Minimum**         **Target**         **Stretch**
CEO       %       %       %
CFO and SVP Sales       %       %       %
Executive Officer and CEO Director Report Vice Presidents       %       %       %
Non-Executive Officer Vice Presidents       %       %       %

Incentives for Company Performance falling between the Performance Targets for each applicable metric shall be determined pursuant to a calculation approved by the Committee. 

Multipliers: 

The Base Incentive for Eligible Persons may be adjusted by application of multipliers based on the Company’s performance against financial and operational metrics as set forth by the Committee. Each multiplier shall potentially increase the Base Incentive amount if the Company meets or exceeds the specified metric and shall potentially decrease the Base Incentive amount if the Company fails to achieve the specified metric. The ranges for these multipliers shall be as follows: 

Multiplier 1: From .85 to 1.10 multiplied against the Base Incentive amount 

Multiplier 2: From .90 to 1.05 multiplied against the Base Incentive amount 

Multiplier 3: From .90 to 1.05 multiplied against the Base Incentive amount 

Collectively, these multipliers may increase the Base Incentive amount by up to [[Percentage 2]]% or decrease the Base Incentive amount by up to .[[Percentage 3]]%. The Committee may, in its sole discretion modify ranges for each multiplier taking into account various factors, including but not limited to, general business and market conditions. 

Individual Performance Incentive: 

In the event that the Committee establishes an incentive pool for payment of the Annual Incentive, the Committee may also establish a pool for payment of an additional incentive amount based on each Eligible Person’s performance in relation to his or her Individual Goals and Objectives for fiscal year 2010. The Committee shall determine in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, which Eligible Persons if any, shall be entitled to such additional incentive and the amount of any applicable incentive. The Individual Performance Incentive amount shall be added to the Annual Incentive after the multipliers set forth above are applied to the Base Incentive. The multipliers shall not apply to the Individual Performance Incentive amount. 

Performance Adjustment: The Administrator shall have discretion to adjust any Eligible Person’s Incentive Amount based on his or her job performance for Fiscal Year 2010 (the “Adjusted Incentive Amount”) by reducing or increasing the Incentive Amount as the Administrator, in its sole discretion deems appropriate, including elimination of the Incentive Award. The Administrator shall also have the discretion to determine that no Mid-Year Incentive Pool and/or Annual Incentive Pool will be funded.

Calculation and Approval: An Eligible Person’s Incentive Amount or Adjusted Incentive Amount, as determined in the manner set forth above, is that Eligible Person’s “Actual Incentive” with respect to Fiscal Year 2010. All calculations of each Actual Incentive must be approved by the Administrator with respect to such participant and the total amount of the aggregate incentive pool to be paid hereunder to all Eligible Persons must be approved by the Committee after such consultation with the Board as it deems appropriate. 

Payments: All amounts, if any, to be paid out hereunder shall be paid in accordance with the Company’s standard payroll practices, within a reasonable amount of time and in accordance with applicable law following determination by the Committee that there shall be a pool from which to make such payments with respect to Mid Year and Fiscal Year 2010 and calculation of applicable incentives. In all cases, amounts, if any, to be paid out hereunder shall be paid no later than [[Date 4: Date]] of the year following the year in which the applicable amount is earned.
