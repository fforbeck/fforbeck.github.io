\centered **FEI COMPANY** 

\centered **1995 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED** 

\centered As amended effective [[Date 1: Date]] 

^**Purpose**. The purpose of this Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) is to enable FEI Company (the “Company”) to attract and retain the services of (1) selected employees, officers and directors of the Company or of any subsidiary of the Company and (2) selected non-employee agents, consultants, advisors, persons involved in the sale or distribution of the Company’s products and independent contractors of the Company or any subsidiary. 

^**Shares Subject to the Plan**. Subject to adjustment as provided below and in paragraph 14, the shares to be offered under the Plan shall consist of Common Stock of the Company, and the total number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan shall not exceed [[Shares 1: Number]] shares. The shares issued under the Plan may be authorized and unissued shares or reacquired shares. If an option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock unit or performance unit granted under the Plan expires, terminates or is canceled, the unissued shares subject to such option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock unit or performance unit shall again be available under the Plan. If shares sold or awarded as a bonus under the Plan are forfeited to the Company or repurchased by the Company, the number of shares forfeited or repurchased shall again be available under the Plan. 

^**Effective Date and Duration of Plan**. 

^^***Effective Date***. The Plan shall become effective as of [[Date 2: Date]]. No option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock unit or performance unit granted under the Plan shall become exercisable, however, until the Plan is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock represented at a shareholders meeting at which a quorum is present and any such awards under the Plan prior to such approval shall be conditioned on and subject to such approval. Subject to this limitation, options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance units may be granted and shares may be awarded as bonuses or sold under the Plan at any time after the effective date and before termination of the Plan. 

^^***Duration***. The Plan shall continue in effect until all shares available for issuance under the Plan have been issued and all restrictions on such shares have lapsed. The Board of Directors may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time except with respect to options, performance units, restricted stock units and shares subject to restrictions then outstanding under the Plan. Termination shall not affect any outstanding options, any right of the Company to repurchase shares or the forfeitability of shares issued under the Plan. 

^**Administration**. 

^^***Board of Directors***. The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company, which shall determine and designate from time to time the individuals to whom awards shall be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board of Directors may from time to time adopt and amend rules and regulations relating to administration of the Plan, advance the lapse of any waiting period, accelerate any exercise date, waive or modify any restriction applicable to shares (except those restrictions imposed by law) and make all other determinations in the judgment of the Board of Directors necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. The interpretation and construction of the provisions of the Plan and related agreements by the Board of Directors shall be final and conclusive. The Board of Directors may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any related agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect, and it shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. 

^^***Committee***. The Board of Directors may delegate to a committee of the Board of Directors or specified officers of the Company, or both (the “Committee”) any or all authority for administration of the Plan. If authority is delegated to a Committee, all references to the Board of Directors in the Plan shall mean and relate to the Committee except (i) as otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, (ii) that only the Board of Directors may amend or terminate the Plan as provided in paragraphs 3 and 15 and (iii) that a Committee including officers of the Company shall not be permitted to grant options to persons who are officers of the Company. To the extent that the Board of Directors determines it to be desirable to qualify awards granted hereunder as “performance-

\centered Ex.10.1-1 

based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more “outside directors” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. 

^**Types of Awards; Eligibility**. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, take the following action, separately or in combination, under the Plan: (i) grant Incentive Stock Options, as defined in section 422 of the Code, as provided in paragraphs 6(a) and 6(b); (ii) grant options other than Incentive Stock Options (“Non-Statutory Stock Options”) as provided in paragraphs 6(a) and 6(c); (iii) award stock bonuses as provided in paragraph 7; (iv) sell shares subject to restrictions as provided in paragraph 8; (v) grant stock appreciation rights as provided in paragraph 9; (vi) grant cash bonus rights as provided in paragraph 10; (vii) grant performance units as provided in paragraph 11; (viii) grant foreign qualified awards as provided in paragraph 12; and (ix) grant restricted stock units as provided in paragraph 13. Any such awards may be made to employees, including employees who are officers or directors, and to other individuals described in paragraph 1 who the Board of Directors believes have made or will make an important contribution to the Company or any subsidiary of the Company; provided, however, that only employees of the Company shall be eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options under the Plan. The Board of Directors shall select the individuals to whom awards shall be made and shall specify the action taken with respect to each individual to whom an award is made. At the discretion of the Board of Directors, an individual may be given an election to surrender an award in exchange for the grant of a new award. 

^**Option Grants**. 

^^***General Rules Relating to Options****.* 

^^^*Terms of Grant*. The Board of Directors may grant options under the Plan. With respect to each option grant, the Board of Directors shall determine the number of shares subject to the option, the option price, the period of the option, the time or times at which the option may be exercised and whether the option is an Incentive Stock Option or a Non-Statutory Stock Option. At the time of the grant of an option or at any time thereafter, the Board of Directors may provide that an optionee who exercised an option with Common Stock of the Company shall automatically receive a new option to purchase additional shares equal to the number of shares surrendered and may specify the terms and conditions of such new options. 

^^^*Exercise of Options*. Except as provided in paragraph 6(a)(iv) or as determined by the Board of Directors, no option granted under the Plan may be exercised unless at the time of such exercise the optionee is employed by or in the service of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company and shall have been so employed or provided such service continuously since the date such option was granted. Absence on leave or on account of illness or disability under rules established by the Board of Directors shall not, however, be deemed an interruption of employment or service for this purpose. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, vesting of options shall not continue during an absence on leave (including an extended illness) or on account of disability. Except as provided in paragraphs 6(a)(iv) and 14, options granted under the Plan may be exercised from time to time over the period stated in each option in such amounts and at such times as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors, provided that options shall not be exercised for fractional shares. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, if the optionee does not exercise an option in any one year with respect to the full number of shares to which the optionee is entitled in that year, the optionee’s rights shall be cumulative and the optionee may purchase those shares in any subsequent year during the term of the option. 

^^^*Nontransferability*. Each Incentive Stock Option and, unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, each other option granted under the Plan by its terms shall be nonassignable and nontransferable by the optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of the optionee’s domicile at the time of death. 

^^^*Termination of Employment or Service*. 

^*General Rule*. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, in the event the employment or service of the optionee with the Company or a subsidiary terminates for any reason other than because of physical disability or death as provided in subparagraphs 6(a)(iv)(B) and (C), the option may be exercised at any time prior to the expiration date of the option or the expiration of 90 days after the date of such termination, whichever is the shorter period, but only if and to the extent the optionee was entitled to exercise the option at the date of such termination. 

\centered Ex.10.1-2 

^*Termination Because of Total Disability*. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, in the event of the termination of employment or service because of total disability, the option may be exercised at any time prior to the expiration date of the option or the expiration of 12 months after the date of such termination, whichever is the shorter period, but only if and to the extent the optionee was entitled to exercise the option at the date of such termination. The term “total disability” means a medically determinable mental or physical impairment which is expected to result in death or which has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of 12 months or more and which causes the optionee to be unable, in the opinion of the Company and two independent physicians, to perform his or her duties as an employee, director, officer or consultant of the Company and to be engaged in any substantial gainful activity. Total disability shall be deemed to have occurred on the first day after the Company and the two independent physicians have furnished their opinion of total disability to the Company. 

^*Termination Because of Death*. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, in the event of the death of an optionee while employed by or providing service to the Company or a subsidiary, the option may be exercised at any time prior to the expiration date of the option or the expiration of 12 months after the date of death, whichever is the shorter period, for any portion of the option exercisable as of the date of death and any outstanding unvested portion of the option, which shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable as of the date of death, and only by the person or persons to whom such optionee’s rights under the option shall pass by the optionee’s will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of domicile at the time of death. 

^*Amendment of Exercise Period Applicable to Termination*. The Board of Directors, at the time of grant or, with respect to an option that is not an Incentive Stock Option, at any time thereafter, may extend the 90-day and 12-month exercise periods any length of time not longer than the original expiration date of the option, and may increase the portion of an option that is exercisable, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may determine. 

^*Failure to Exercise Option*. To the extent that the option of any deceased optionee or of any optionee whose employment or service terminates is not exercised within the applicable period, all further rights to purchase shares pursuant to such option shall cease and terminate. 

^^*Purchase of Shares*. Unless the Board of Directors determines otherwise, shares may be acquired pursuant to an option granted under the Plan only upon receipt by the Company of (A) notice in writing from the optionee of the optionee’s intention to exercise, specifying the number of shares as to which the optionee desires to exercise the option and the date on which the optionee desires to complete the transaction, and if required in order to comply with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, containing a representation that it is the optionee’s present intention to acquire the shares for investment and not with a view to distribution, and (B) payment of the full purchase price of the shares of Common Stock with respect to which the option is exercised (together with applicable withholding taxes) in cash (including, with the consent of the Board of Directors, cash that may be the proceeds of a loan from the Company (provided that, with respect to an Incentive Stock Option, such loan is approved at the time of option grant)) or, with the consent of the Board of Directors, in whole or in part, in Common Stock of the Company valued at fair market value, restricted stock, performance units or other contingent awards denominated in either stock or cash, promissory notes and other forms of consideration. The fair market value of Common Stock provided in payment of the purchase price shall be determined by the Board of Directors. If the Common Stock of the Company is not publicly traded on the date the option is exercised, the Board of Directors may consider any valuation methods it deems appropriate and may, but is not required to, obtain one or more independent appraisals of the Company. If the Common Stock of the Company is publicly traded on the date the option is exercised, the fair market value of Common Stock provided in payment of the purchase price shall be the closing price of the Common Stock as reported in *The Wall Street Journal* on the last trading day preceding the date the option is exercised, or such other reported value of the Common Stock as shall be specified by the Board of Directors. No shares shall be issued until full payment for the shares (together with applicable withholding taxes) has been made. With the consent of the Board of Directors (which, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be given only at the time of option grant), an optionee may request the Company to apply automatically the shares to 

\centered Ex.10.1-3 

be received upon the exercise of a portion of a stock option (even though stock certificates have not yet been issued) to satisfy the purchase price for additional portions of the option. Upon the exercise of an option, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the number of shares issued upon exercise of the option. 

^^***Incentive Stock Options***. Incentive Stock Options shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions: 

^^^*Limitation on Amount of Grants*. No employee may be granted Incentive Stock Options under the Plan if the aggregate fair market value, on the date of grant, of the Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by that employee during any calendar year under the Plan and under all incentive stock option plans (within the meaning of section 422 of the Code) of the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the Company exceeds $[[USD Value 1: Number]] 

^^^*Limitations on Grants to 10 Percent Shareholders*. An Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the Plan to an employee possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any parent or subsidiary of the Company only if the option price is at least 110 percent of the fair market value, as described in paragraph 6(b)(iv), of the Common Stock subject to the option on the date it is granted and the option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date it is granted. 

^^^*Duration of Options*. Subject to paragraphs 6(a)(ii) and 6(b)(ii), Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan shall continue in effect for the period fixed by the Board of Directors, except that no Incentive Stock Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date it is granted. 

^^^*Option Price*. The option price per share shall be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of grant. Except as provided in paragraph 6(b)(ii), the option price shall not be less than 100 percent of the fair market value of the Common Stock covered by the Incentive Stock Option at the date the option is granted. The fair market value shall be determined by the Board of Directors. If the Common Stock of the Company is not publicly traded on the date the option is granted, the Board of Directors may consider any valuation methods it deems appropriate and may, but is not required to, obtain one or more independent appraisals of the Company. If the Common Stock of the Company is publicly traded on the date the option is exercised, the fair market value shall be deemed to be the closing price of the Common Stock as reported in *The Wall Street Journal* on the day preceding the date the option is granted, or, if there has been no sale on that date, on the last preceding date on which a sale occurred or such other value of the Common Stock as shall be specified by the Board of Directors. 

^^^*Limitation on Time of Grant*. No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted on or after the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan. 

^^^*Conversion of Incentive Stock Options*. The Board of Directors may at any time without the consent of the optionee convert an Incentive Stock Option to a Non-Statutory Stock Option. 

^^***Non-Statutory Stock Options***. Non-Statutory Stock Options shall be subject to the following terms and conditions in addition to those set forth in Section 6(a) above: 

^^^*Option Price*. The option price for Non-Statutory Stock Options shall be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of grant and may be any amount determined by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Non-Statutory Stock Options intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the option price will be no less than 100 percent of the fair market value per share on the date of grant. 

^^^*Duration of Options*. Non-Statutory Stock Options granted under the Plan shall continue in effect for the period fixed by the Board of Directors. 

\centered Ex.10.1-4 

^**Stock Bonuses**. The Board of Directors may award shares under the Plan as stock bonuses. Shares awarded as a bonus shall be subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions determined by the Board of Directors. The restrictions may include restrictions concerning transferability and forfeiture of the shares awarded, together with such other restrictions as may be determined by the Board of Directors. If shares are subject to forfeiture, all dividends or other distributions paid by the Company with respect to the shares shall be retained by the Company until the shares are no longer subject to forfeiture, at which time all accumulated amounts shall be paid to the recipient. The Board of Directors may require the recipient to sign an agreement as a condition of the award, but may not require the recipient to pay any monetary consideration other than amounts necessary to satisfy tax withholding requirements. The agreement may contain any terms, conditions, restrictions, representations and warranties required by the Board of Directors. The certificates representing the shares awarded shall bear any legends required by the Board of Directors. The Company may require any recipient of a stock bonus to pay to the Company in cash upon demand amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state or local tax withholding requirements. If the recipient fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company may withhold that amount from other amounts payable by the Company to the recipient, including salary or fees for services, subject to applicable law. With the consent of the Board of Directors, a recipient may deliver Common Stock to the Company to satisfy this withholding obligation. Upon the issuance of a stock bonus, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the number of shares issued. 

^**Restricted Stock**. The Board of Directors may issue shares under the Plan for such consideration (including promissory notes and services) as determined by the Board of Directors. Shares issued under the Plan shall be subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions determined by the Board of Directors. The restrictions may include restrictions concerning transferability, repurchase by the Company and forfeiture of the shares issued, together with such other restrictions as may be determined by the Board of Directors. If shares are subject to forfeiture or repurchase by the Company, all dividends or other distributions paid by the Company with respect to the shares shall be retained by the Company until the shares are no longer subject to forfeiture or repurchase, at which time all accumulated amounts shall be paid to the recipient. All Common Stock issued pursuant to this paragraph 8 shall be subject to a purchase agreement, which shall be executed by the Company and the prospective recipient of the shares prior to the delivery of certificates representing such shares to the recipient. The purchase agreement may contain any terms, conditions, restrictions, representations and warranties required by the Board of Directors. The certificates representing the shares shall bear any legends required by the Board of Directors. The Company may require any purchaser of restricted stock to pay to the Company in cash upon demand amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state or local tax withholding requirements. If the purchaser fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company may withhold that amount from other amounts payable by the Company to the purchaser, including salary, subject to applicable law. With the consent of the Board of Directors, a purchaser may deliver Common Stock to the Company to satisfy this withholding obligation. Upon the issuance of restricted stock, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the number of shares issued. 

^**Stock Appreciation Rights**. 

^^***Grant***. Stock appreciation rights may be granted under the Plan by the Board of Directors, subject to such rules, terms, and conditions as the Board of Directors prescribes. 

^^***Exercise***. 

^^^Each stock appreciation right shall entitle the holder, upon exercise, to receive from the Company in exchange therefore an amount equal in value to the excess of the fair market value on the date of exercise of one share of Common Stock of the Company over its fair market value on the date of grant (or, in the case of a stock appreciation right granted in connection with an option, the excess of the fair market value of one share of Common Stock of the Company over the option price per share under the option to which the stock appreciation right relates), multiplied by the number of shares covered by the stock appreciation right or the option, or portion thereof, that is surrendered. No stock appreciation right shall be exercisable at a time that the amount determined under this subparagraph is negative. Payment by the Company upon exercise of a stock appreciation right may be made in Common Stock valued at fair market value, in cash, or partly in Common Stock and partly in cash, all as determined by the Board of Directors. 

^^^A stock appreciation right shall be exercisable only at the time or times established by the Board of Directors. If a stock appreciation right is granted in connection with an option, the following rules shall apply: (1) the stock appreciation right shall be exercisable only to the extent and on the same 

\centered Ex.10.1-5 

conditions that the related option could be exercised; (2) the stock appreciation right shall be exercisable only when the fair market value of the stock exceeds the option price of the related option; (3) the stock appreciation right shall be for no more than 100 percent of the excess of the fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise over the option price; (4) upon exercise of the stock appreciation right, the option or portion thereof to which the stock appreciation right relates terminates; and (5) upon exercise of the option, the related stock appreciation right or portion thereof terminates. 

^^^The Board of Directors may withdraw any stock appreciation right granted under the Plan at any time and may impose any conditions upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right or adopt rules and regulations from time to time affecting the rights of holders of stock appreciation rights. Such rules and regulations may govern the right to exercise stock appreciation rights granted prior to adoption or amendment of such rules and regulations as well as stock appreciation rights granted thereafter. 

^^^For purposes of this paragraph 9, the fair market value of the Common Stock shall be determined as of the date the stock appreciation right is exercised, under the methods set forth in paragraph 6(b)(iv). 

^^^No fractional shares shall be issued upon exercise of a stock appreciation right. In lieu thereof, cash may be paid in an amount equal to the value of the fraction or, if the Board of Directors shall determine, the number of shares may be rounded downward to the next whole share. 

^^^Each stock appreciation right granted in connection with an Incentive Stock Option, and unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, each other stock appreciation right granted under the Plan by its terms shall be nonassignable and nontransferable by the holder, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of the holder’s domicile at the time of death, and each stock appreciation right by its terms shall be exercisable during the holder’s lifetime only by the holder. 

^^^At the time the participant exercises a stock appreciation right, the participant must pay to the Company in cash amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. If the participant fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company may withhold that amount from other amounts payable by the Company to the participant including salary, subject to applicable law. With the consent of the Board of Directors a participant may satisfy this obligation, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold from any shares to be issued upon the exercise that number of shares that would satisfy the withholding amount due or by delivering Common Stock to the Company to satisfy the withholding amount. 

^^^Upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right for shares, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the number of shares issued. Cash payments of stock appreciation rights shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan. 

^***Cash Bonus Rights***. 

^^***Grant***. The Board of Directors may grant cash bonus rights under the Plan in connection with (i) options granted or previously granted, (ii) stock appreciation rights granted or previously granted, (iii) stock bonuses awarded or previously awarded and (iv) shares sold or previously sold under the Plan. Cash bonus rights will be subject to rules, terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may prescribe. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, each cash bonus right granted under the Plan by its terms shall be nonassignable and nontransferable by the holder, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of the holder’s domicile at the time of death. The payment of a cash bonus shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan. 

^^***Cash Bonus Rights in Connection With Options***. A cash bonus right granted in connection with an option will entitle an optionee to a cash bonus when the related option is exercised (or terminates in connection with the exercise of a stock appreciation right related to the option) in whole or in part if, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, the bonus right will result in a tax deduction that the Company has sufficient 

\centered Ex.10.1-6 

taxable income to use. If an optionee purchases shares upon exercise of an option and does not exercise a related stock appreciation right, the amount of the bonus, if any, shall be determined by multiplying the excess of the total fair market value of the shares to be acquired upon the exercise over the total option price for the shares by the applicable bonus percentage. If the optionee exercises a related stock appreciation right in connection with the termination of an option, the amount of the bonus, if any, shall be determined by multiplying the total fair market value of the shares and cash received pursuant to the exercise of the stock appreciation right by the applicable bonus percentage. The bonus percentage applicable to a bonus right, including a previously granted bonus right, may be changed from time to time at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors but shall in no event exceed 75 percent. 

^^***Cash Bonus Rights in Connection With Stock Bonus***. A cash bonus right granted in connection with a stock bonus will entitle the recipient to a cash bonus payable when the stock bonus is awarded or restrictions, if any, to which the stock is subject lapse. If bonus stock awarded is subject to restrictions and is repurchased by the Company or forfeited by the holder, the cash bonus right granted in connection with the stock bonus shall terminate and may not be exercised. The amount and timing of payment of a cash bonus shall be determined by the Board of Directors. 

^^***Cash Bonus Rights in Connection With Stock Purchases***. A cash bonus right granted in connection with the purchase of stock pursuant to paragraph 8 will entitle the recipient to a cash bonus when the shares are purchased or restrictions, if any, to which the stock is subject lapse. Any cash bonus right granted in connection with shares purchased pursuant to paragraph 8 shall terminate and may not be exercised in the event the shares are repurchased by the Company or forfeited by the holder pursuant to applicable restrictions. The amount of any cash bonus to be awarded and timing of payment of a cash bonus shall be determined by the Board of Directors. 

^^***Taxes***. The Company shall withhold from any cash bonus paid pursuant to paragraph 10 the amount necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state and local withholding requirements. 

^**Performance Units**. The Board of Directors may grant performance units consisting of monetary units which may be earned in whole or in part if the Company achieves certain goals established by the Board of Directors over a designated period of time, but not in any event more than 10 years. The goals established by the Board of Directors may include earnings per share, return on shareholders’ equity, return on invested capital, and such other goals as may be established by the Board of Directors. In the event that the minimum performance goal established by the Board of Directors is not achieved at the conclusion of a period, no payment shall be made to the participants. In the event the maximum corporate goal is achieved, 100 percent of the monetary value of the performance units shall be paid to or vested in the participants. Partial achievement of the maximum goal may result in a payment or vesting corresponding to the degree of achievement as determined by the Board of Directors. Payment of an award earned may be in cash or in Common Stock or in a combination of both, and may be made when earned, or vested and deferred, as the Board of Directors determines. Deferred awards shall earn interest on the terms and at a rate determined by the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, each performance unit granted under the Plan by its terms shall be nonassignable and nontransferable by the holder, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of the holder’s domicile at the time of death. Each participant who has been awarded a performance unit shall, upon notification of the amount due, pay to the Company in cash amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. If the participant fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company may withhold that amount from other amounts payable by the Company to the participant, including salary or fees for services, subject to applicable law. With the consent of the Board of Directors a participant may satisfy this obligation, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold from any shares to be issued that number of shares that would satisfy the withholding amount due or by delivering Common Stock to the Company to satisfy the withholding amount. The payment of a performance unit in cash shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the number of shares issued upon payment of an award. 

^**Foreign Qualified Grants**. Awards under the Plan may be granted to such officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and such other persons described in paragraph 1 residing in foreign jurisdictions as the Board of Directors may determine from time to time. The Board of Directors may adopt such supplements to the Plan as may be necessary to comply with the applicable laws of such foreign jurisdictions and to afford participants favorable treatment under such laws; provided, however, that no award shall be granted under any such supplement with terms which are more beneficial to the participants than the terms permitted by the Plan. 

\centered Ex.10.1-7 

^**Restricted Stock Units**. 

^^***Grant***. Restricted stock units may be granted at any time and from time to time as determined by the Board of Directors. For this purpose, a restricted stock unit shall mean a bookkeeping entry representing an amount equal to the fair market value of one share of Common Stock, granted pursuant to this paragraph 13. Each restricted stock unit represents an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. Each restricted stock unit grant will be evidenced by an agreement that will specify such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, will determine, including all terms, conditions, and restrictions related to the grant, the number of restricted stock units and the form of payout, which, subject to paragraph 13(d), may be left to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

^^***Vesting Criteria and Other Terms***. The Board of Directors will set vesting criteria in its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which the criteria are met, will determine the number of restricted stock units that will be paid out to the participant. The Board of Directors may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued employment), or any other basis determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion. 

^^***Earning Restricted Stock Units***. Upon meeting the applicable vesting criteria, the participant will be entitled to receive a payout as specified in the award agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the grant of restricted stock units, the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any vesting criteria that must be met to receive a payout. 

^^***Form and Timing of Payment***. Payment of earned restricted stock units will be made as soon as practicable after the date(s) set forth in the award agreement. The Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may pay earned restricted stock units in cash, shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof. Shares of Common Stock represented by restricted stock units that are fully paid in cash again will be available for grant under the Plan. 

^^***Cancellation***. On the date set forth in the award agreement, all unearned restricted stock units will be forfeited to the Company. 

^^***Transferability***. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, each restricted stock unit granted under the Plan by its terms shall be nonassignable and nontransferable by the holder, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of the holder’s domicile at the time of death. 

^**Changes in Capital Structure**. 

^^***Stock Splits; Stock Dividends***. If the outstanding Common Stock of the Company is hereafter increased or decreased or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company by reason of any stock split, combination of shares or dividend payable in shares, recapitalization or reclassification appropriate adjustment shall be made by the Board of Directors in the number and kind of shares available for grants under the Plan. In addition, the Board of Directors shall make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind of shares as to which outstanding options, or portions thereof then unexercised, shall be exercisable, so that the optionee’s proportionate interest before and after the occurrence of the event is maintained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall have no obligation to effect any adjustment that would or might result in the issuance of fractional shares, and any fractional shares resulting from any adjustment may be disregarded or provided for in any manner determined by the Board of Directors. Any such adjustments made by the Board of Directors shall be conclusive. 

\centered Ex.10.1-8 

^^***Mergers, Reorganizations, Etc***. In the event of a merger, consolidation, plan of exchange, acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization or liquidation to which the Company or a subsidiary is a party or a sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets (each, a “Transaction”), the Board of Directors shall, in its sole discretion and to the extent possible under the structure of the Transaction, select one of the following alternatives for treating outstanding options under the Plan: 

^^^Outstanding options shall remain in effect in accordance with their terms. 

^^^Outstanding options shall be converted into options to purchase stock in the corporation that is the surviving or acquiring corporation in the Transaction. The amount, type of securities subject thereto and exercise price of the converted options shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, taking into account the relative values of the companies involved in the Transaction and the exchange rate, if any, used in determining shares of the surviving corporation to be issued to holders of shares of the Company. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, the converted options shall be vested only to the extent that the vesting requirements relating to options granted hereunder have been satisfied. 

^^^The Board of Directors shall provide a 30-day period prior to the consummation of the Transaction during which outstanding options may be exercised to the extent then exercisable, and upon the expiration of such 30-day period, all unexercised options shall immediately terminate. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the exercisability of options so that they are exercisable in full during such 30-day period. 

^^***Dissolution of the Company***. In the event of the dissolution of the Company, options shall be treated in accordance with paragraph 14(b)(iii). 

^^***Rights Issued by Another Corporation***. The Board of Directors may also grant options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, stock bonuses and cash bonuses and issue restricted stock under the Plan having terms, conditions and provisions that vary from those specified in this Plan provided that any such awards are granted in substitution for, or in connection with the assumption of, existing options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, cash bonuses, restricted stock and performance units granted, awarded or issued by another corporation and assumed or otherwise agreed to be provided for by the Company pursuant to or by reason of a Transaction. 

^^***Non-employee Director Awards***. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to awards granted to a Non-employee Director, including, but not limited to, awards granted pursuant to paragraph 19, the Non-employee Director shall, immediately prior to the Transaction, fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding options and stock appreciation rights, including shares as to which such awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable and all restrictions on restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and other awards will lapse, and, with respect to awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) on-target levels and all other terms and conditions met. 

^**Amendment of Plan**. The Board of Directors may at any time, and from time to time, modify or amend the Plan in such respects as it shall deem advisable because of changes in the law while the Plan is in effect or for any other reason. Except as provided in paragraphs 6(a)(iv), 9, 10 and 14, however, no change in an award already granted shall be made without the written consent of the holder of such award. 

^**Approvals**. The obligations of the Company under the Plan are subject to the approval of state and federal authorities or agencies with jurisdiction in the matter. The Company will use its best efforts to take steps required by state or federal law or applicable regulations, including rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and any stock exchange on which the Company’s shares may then be listed, in connection with the grants under the Plan. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated to issue or deliver Common Stock under the Plan if such issuance or delivery would violate applicable state or federal securities laws.

^**Employment and Service Rights**. Nothing in the Plan or any award pursuant to the Plan shall (i) confer upon any employee any right to be continued in the employment of the Company or any subsidiary or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any subsidiary by whom such employee is employed to terminate such employee’s employment at any time, for any reason, with or without cause, or to decrease such employee’s compensation or benefits, or (ii) confer upon any person engaged by the Company any right to be retained or employed by the Company or to the continuation, extension, renewal, or modification of any compensation, contract, or arrangement with or by the Company. 

^**Rights as a Shareholder**. The recipient of any award under the Plan shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Common Stock until the date of issue to the recipient of a stock certificate for such shares. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs prior to the date such stock certificate is issued. 

^**Restricted Stock Unit and Option Grants to Non-Employee Directors**. 

^^***Initial Board Grants***. Each Non-Employee Director shall be automatically granted restricted stock units equal to [[Shares 2: Number]] shares of Common Stock on the date such person first becomes a Non-Employee Director, whether through election by the shareholders of the Company or appointment by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy. A “Non-Employee Director” is a director who is not an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a director who ceases to be an employee of the Company but remains a director of the Company and thereby becomes a Non-Employee Director shall not receive the grant of restricted stock units provided under this paragraph 19(a). 

^^***Additional Grants***. Each Non-Employee Director shall be automatically granted additional restricted stock units equal to [[Shares 3: Number]] shares of Common Stock and options to purchase [[Shares 4: Number]] shares of Common Stock in each calendar year subsequent to the year in which such person became a Non-Employee Director, such restricted stock units and options to be granted as of the date of the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders held in such calendar year, provided that the Non-Employee Director continues to serve in such capacity as of such date. 

^^***Terms of Restricted Stock Units***. 

^^^*Award Agreement*. Each award of restricted stock units granted pursuant to this paragraph 19 shall be evidenced by an agreement that will specify the number of restricted stock units and such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, shall determine, consistent with the Plan, including all terms, conditions, and restrictions related to the grant and the form of payout, which, subject to paragraph 19(c)(ii), may be left to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

^^^*Vesting*. Subject to paragraph 14, each award of restricted stock units granted pursuant to paragraph 19(a) shall vest as to twenty-five percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the restricted stock units on the anniversary of the grant date in each of the four calendar years following the year in which the award is granted. Subject to paragraph 14, each award of restricted stock units granted pursuant to Section 19(b) shall vest as follows: (A) awards granted prior to [[Date 3: Date]] shall vest as to twenty-five percent ([[Percentage 2]]%) of the restricted stock units on [[Date 4: Date]] of each of the four calendar years following the year in which the award is granted; (B) awards granted in 2010 shall vest as to one-third (1/3rd) of the restricted stock units on [[Date 4]] of each of the three calendar years following the year in which the award is granted; (C) awards granted in 2011 shall vest as to fifty percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the restricted stock units on [[Date 4]] of each of the two calendar years following the year in which the award is granted; and (D) awards granted in 2012 or thereafter shall vest as to one hundred percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the restricted stock units on [[Date 4]] of the calendar year following the year in which the award is granted. Vesting pursuant to this paragraph 19(c)(ii) shall be conditioned on the Non-employee Director continuing to serve as a director of the Company through each such applicable vesting date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Non-employee Director ceases to be a director of the Company due to death, one hundred percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the unvested portion of the restricted stock units subject to the award shall vest on the date of the Non-employee Director’s death. 

^^^*Form and Timing of Payment*. Payment of restricted stock units shall be made as soon as practicable following the date on which such restricted stock units vest in accordance with paragraph 19(c)(ii). The Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may pay vested restricted stock units in cash, shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof. Shares of Common Stock represented by restricted stock units that are fully paid in cash shall again be available for grant under the Plan.

^^***Terms of Options***. 

^^^*Award Agreement*.

^^^*Vesting*. Subject to paragraph 14, each award of options granted pursuant to this paragraph 19 shall vest as follows: (A) awards granted in 2010 shall vest as to one-third (1/3rd) of the shares subject to the option on [[Date 4]] of each of the three calendar years following the year in which the award is granted; (B) awards granted in 2011 shall vest as to fifty percent ([[Percentage 3]]%) of the shares subject to the option on [[Date 4]] of each of the two calendar years following the year in which the award is granted; and (C) awards granted in 2012 or thereafter shall vest as to one hundred percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the shares subject to the option on [[Date 4]] of the calendar year following the year in which the award is granted.

The Board of Directors of the Company reserves the right to amend this paragraph 19 as it deems necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Non-employee Director, to comply with Section 409A of the Code or to otherwise avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition under Section 409A of the Code. 

^^***Nontransferability***. Each restricted stock unit and option by its terms shall be nonassignable and nontransferable by the holder, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of the holder’s domicile at the time of death. 

^**Code Section 162(m) Provisions**. 

^^***Option and SAR Annual Share Limit***. No individual shall be granted, in any calendar year, options and stock appreciation rights to purchase more than [[Shares 5: Number]] shares of Common Stock; provided, however, that such limit shall be [[Shares 6: Number]] shares of Common Stock in the individual’s first calendar year of Company service. 

^^***Restricted Stock, Stock Bonus, Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Unit Annual Limits***. No individual shall be granted, in any calendar year, more than [[Shares 7: Number]] shares of Common Stock in the aggregate of the following: (i) restricted stock, (ii) stock bonuses, or (iii) restricted stock units. No individual shall be granted, in any calendar year, performance units having an initial value greater than $[[USD Value 2: Number]]

As determined by the Committee, the Performance Goals applicable to an award may provide for a targeted level or levels of achievement using one or more of the following measures: (a) Operating Income, (b) Pretax Income, and (c) Return on Sales. The Performance Goals may differ from employee to employee and from award to award. Any criteria used may be measured, as applicable, (i) in absolute terms, (ii) in relative terms (including, but not limited to, passage of time and/or against another company or companies), (iii) on a per-share basis, (iv) against the performance of the Company as a whole or of a business unit of the Company, and/or (v) to the extent not otherwise specified by the definition of the Performance Goal, on a pre-tax or after-tax basis.

\centered Ex.10.1-11 

^^^“*Operating Income*” means the Company’s or a business unit’s income from operations determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

^^^“*Pretax Income*” means the Company’s or a business unit’s income before taxes, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

^^^“*Return on Sales*” means the percentage equal to the Company’s or a business unit’s Operating Income before incentive compensation, divided by the Company’s or the business unit’s, as applicable, revenue, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

^^***Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions***. For purposes of qualifying grants of restricted stock, stock bonuses, restricted stock units and performance units as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals shall be set by the Committee on or before the latest date permissible to enable the restricted stock, stock bonuses, restricted stock units and performance units to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting restricted stock, stock bonuses, restricted stock units and performance units which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals). 

^^***Changes in Capitalization***. The numerical limitations in Sections 20(a) and 20(b) shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company’s capitalization as described in Section 14(a). 

^^If an award is cancelled in the same calendar year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 14 of the Plan), the cancelled award will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (a) and (b) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an option is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the option and the grant of a new option.
