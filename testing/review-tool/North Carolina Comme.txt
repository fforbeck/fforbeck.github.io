Landlord is hereby irrevocably vested with full power and authority to subordinate this Lease to any mortgage, deed of trust or other lien now existing or hereafter placed upon the Leased Premises of the Building, and Tenant agrees upon demand to execute such further instruments subordinating this Lease or attorning to the holder of any such liens as Landlord may request. In the event that Tenant should fail to execute any instrument of subordination herein required to be executed by Tenant promptly as requested, Tenant hereby irrevocably constitutes Landlord as its attorney-in-fact to execute such instrument in Tenant's name, place and stead, it being agreed that such power is one coupled with an interest.

^**Security Deposit**.  
The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord without liability for interest and as security for the performance by Tenant of Tenant's covenants and obligations under this Lease, it being expressly understood that the Security Deposit shall not be considered an advance payment of rental or a measure of Landlord's damages in case of default by Tenant. Unless otherwise provided by mandatory non-waivable law or regulation, Landlord may commingle the Security Deposit with Landlord' s other funds. Landlord may, from time to time, without prejudice to any other remedy, use the Security Deposit to the extent necessary to make good any arrearages of rent or to satisfy any other covenant or obligation of Tenant hereunder. Following any such application of the Security Deposit, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand the amount so applied in order to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. If Tenant is not in default at the termination of this Lease, the balance of the Security Deposit remaining after any such application shall be returned by Landlord to Tenant within thirty days after termination of the Lease Agreement.
