\centered **CERTIFICATE OF [[Battery]]ORPORATION** 

\centered **of** 

\centered [[Parent]] 

[[Parent]] (the “Corporation”), a corporation organized and existing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, DOES HEREBY CERTIFY AS FOLLOWS: 

ONE: The name of the Corporation is [[Parent]] The original Certificate of [[Battery]]orporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on [[Date 5: Date]] under the name “SB/RH Holdings, [[Battery]]” A Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of [[Battery]]orporation of the Corporation changing the name of the Corporation from SB/RH Holdings, [[Battery]] to [[Parent]] was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on [[Date 6: Date]]. 

TWO: This Restated Certificate of [[Battery]]orporation (this “Certificate”), having been duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as amended from time to time, the “DGCL”), and by the written consent of the stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL amends and restates the Certificate of [[Battery]]orporation of the Corporation (as amended) in its entirety. 

THREE: The Certificate of [[Battery]]orporation of the Corporation (as amended) is hereby amended and restated to read as follows: 

^Name. The name of the Corporation is [[Parent]] (the “Corporation”). 

^Address; Registered Office and Agent. The address of the Corporation’s registered office is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware 19808; and the name of its registered agent at such address is Corporation Service Company. 

^Purposes. The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the DGCL. 

^Capital Stock. 

^^The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of capital stock, designated as Common Stock and Preferred Stock. The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 300,000,000, consisting of [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of Common Stock, with a par value of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] per share (the “Common Stock”), and [[Shares 2: Number]] shares of Preferred Stock, with a par value of $[[USD Value 2]] per share (the “Preferred 

Stock”). Subject to the rights of any holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of either of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be [[Battery]]reased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of either of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor. 

^^The Preferred Stock may be issued in one or more series. The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board”) is hereby authorized to issue the shares of Preferred Stock in such series, and to fix from time to time before issuance, the number of shares to be [[Battery]]luded in any such series and the designation, powers, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such series. The authority of the Board with respect to each such series will [[Battery]]lude, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the determination of any or all of the following: 

^^the number of shares of any series and the designation to distinguish the shares of such series from the shares of all other series; 

^^the voting powers, if any, and whether such voting powers are full or limited in such series; 

^^the redemption provisions, if any, applicable to such series, [[Battery]]luding the redemption price or prices to be paid; 

^^whether dividends, if any, will be cumulative or noncumulative, the dividend rate of such series, and the dates and preferences of dividends on such series; 

^^the rights of such series upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the Corporation; 

^^the provisions, if any, pursuant to which the shares of such series are convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes or of any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock, or any other security, of the Corporation or any other corporation or other entity, and the rates or other determinants of conversion or exchange applicable thereto; 

^^the right, if any, to subscribe for or to purchase any securities of the Corporation or any other corporation or other entity; 

^^the provisions, if any, of a sinking fund applicable to such series; and 

^^any other powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof; 

all as may be determined from time to time by the Board and stated or expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such Preferred Stock (collectively, a “Preferred Stock Designation”), and as may be permitted by the DGCL. 

^^Except as may otherwise be provided in this Certificate, by applicable Law, or by a Preferred Stock Designation, each holder of Common Stock, as such, shall have the exclusive right to vote, and shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder, on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote, [[Battery]]luding the election of Directors to the Board. To the fullest extent permitted by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, any amendment to this Certificate ([[Battery]]luding any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate ([[Battery]]luding any Preferred Stock Designation) or pursuant to the DGCL. 

^^Subject to applicable Law and the rights, if any, of the holders of outstanding Preferred Stock set forth in a Preferred Stock Designation, if any, dividends may be declared and paid on the Common Stock at such times and in such amounts as the Board in its discretion shall determine. 

^^Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock set forth in a Preferred Stock Designation, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by them. 

^Election of Directors; Vacancies. 

^^Subject to any rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the initial number of Directors shall be ten (10). Thereafter, the number of Directors shall be determined in accordance with the Corporation’s by-laws (the “By-laws”). Unless and except to the extent that the By-laws shall so require, the election of Directors need not be by written ballot. 

^^The Board (other than those Directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock) shall be divided into three classes, designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, with the first class initially consisting of four Directors (one of whom will be the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation), and each other class initially consisting of three Directors. The term of office of each class shall be three years and shall expire in successive years at the time of the annual meeting of stockholders. The Directors first appointed to Class I shall initially hold office for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Section 5.2; the Directors first appointed to Class II shall initially hold office for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Section 5.2; and the Directors first appointed to Class III shall initially hold office for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Section 5.2. At each annual meeting of stockholders, the successors to the class of Directors whose term shall then expire shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual 

meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation, retirement, removal or death. Any Director elected to fill a vacancy shall have the same remaining term as that of his predecessor. In case of any [[Battery]]rease or decrease, from time to time, in the number of Directors (other than Directors elected by holders of any series of Preferred Stock), the number of Directors in each class shall be apportioned as nearly equal as possible. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. 

^^Notwithstanding Section 5.2, at any time the Board can be declassified upon (a) majority approval of the Board, [[Battery]]luding approval of a majority of the members of the Special Nominating Committee or (b) if the Special Nominating Committee has been dissolved pursuant to Section 6.2(c), upon majority approval of the Board (either (a) or (b) being a “Declassification Vote”). Any Declassification Vote shall be publicly announced and a record thereof shall be maintained on file at the pr[[Battery]]ipal office of the Corporation and, upon request, will be made available to any stockholder of the Corporation. In the event of a Declassification Vote, effective as of the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders (the “Declassification Date”), Section 5.2 of this Certificate shall automatically terminate and be of no further effect, and, subject to any rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock, stockholders will elect all Directors on an annual basis; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.3 shall shorten the term of any [[Battery]]umbent Director on the Declassification Date. After the Declassification Date, no such [[Battery]]umbent Director may be removed without cause except by a vote of stockholders holding (i) a majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities and (ii) a majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities not held by a Significant Stockholder or any member of a Restricted Group. After the Declassification Date, Directors shall be elected, and vacancies and newly created directorships shall be filled, as set forth in the By-laws. 

^^Directors, unless employed by and receiving a salary from the Corporation, shall receive such compensation for serving on the Board and for attending meetings of the Board and any committee thereof as may be fixed by the Board. Directors shall be reimbursed their reasonable expenses [[Battery]]urred while engaged in the business of the Corporation. 

^Committees of the Board. 

^^General. The Board may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the Directors with such power and authority as the Board determines; provided, however, that the designation of any such committee and the power and authority granted thereto (other than an audit committee or compensation committee having customary powers and authorities for such respective committees) shall require the Special Approval. 

^^Special Nominating Committee. A committee (the “Special Nominating Committee”) shall be established as follows: 

^^Designation and Qualifications. The Special Nominating Committee shall consist of three Directors, each of whom shall be an Independent Director. The Special Nominating Committee shall initially consist of Marc S. Kirschner, Norman S. Matthews and 

Hugh R. Rovit. Any vacancy on the Special Nominating Committee that results from one of such individuals’ (or his or her successor’s) resignation or removal from the Board or death shall be filled exclusively by a majority of the Special Nominating Committee then in office or by the sole remaining member of the Special Nominating Committee. 

^^Powers and Actions. The Special Nominating Committee shall have the exclusive power and authority (i) to nominate persons for election to the Board as described in Section 3.4(B)(i) of the By-laws, (ii) to take all actions and make all determinations which (x) this Certificate, (y) the By-Laws, or (z) the Stockholder Agreement, dated as of [[Date 2]], by and among the Harbinger Parties and the Corporation, as it may be amended from time to time (the “Stockholder Agreement”), provides shall be taken or made by the Special Nominating Committee or with Special Approval, as the case may be, and (iii) to enforce on behalf of the Corporation such Stockholder Agreement [[Battery]]luding, if necessary, bringing claims and litigation for breach of such Stockholder Agreement, and to take all actions deemed by the Special Nominating Committee to be necessary or appropriate in connection therewith. All out of pocket costs and expenses ([[Battery]]luding attorneys’ fees) [[Battery]]urred by the Special Nominating Committee shall be paid or reimbursed by the Corporation. Without limiting the foregoing, the Special Nominating Committee is expressly authorized to retain attorneys and other advisors at the expense of the Corporation. 

^^Dissolution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.2, the Special Nominating Committee shall immediately cease to exist if at any time there is no Person who, together with such Person’s Affiliates or members of a group to which such Person belongs, Beneficially Owns [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the Outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, that the Special Nominating Committee shall be re-constituted and established if at any time prior to three years following the date on which the Special Committee ceases to exist, the Prior Significant Stockholder reacquires Beneficial Ownership of [[Percentage 1]]% or more of the Outstanding Voting Securities, and upon so being re-constituted and established the Special Nominating Committee shall initially consist of (i) the persons who were members of the Special Nominating Committee on the date it ceased to exist (the “Legacy Committee Members”); or (ii) if one or more of the Legacy Committee members is no longer a member of the Board, the remaining Legacy Committee Member or Members and such additional person or persons as may be designated by the remaining Legacy Committee Member(s) and who qualify as Independent Directors, who shall be appointed to the Board (subject to applicable fiduciary duties as to the qualifications of such persons) to fill any existing vacancies or to newly-created Board seats to the extent no vacancies then exist on the Board (and the number of Directors shall automatically be [[Battery]]reased to the extent so required); or (iii) if no Legacy Committee Members remain as Directors at the time the Special Nominating Committee is re-constituted, the initial members of the re-constituted Special Nominating Committee shall be three Independent Directors designated by a majority of the Independent Directors then serving. The “Prior Significant Stockholder” means the Person that, together with its Affiliates or members of a group to which such Person belongs, Beneficially Owned [[Percentage 1]]% or more of the Outstanding Voting Securities immediately prior to the Special Nominating Committee ceasing to exist pursuant to this Section 6.2(c). 

^^Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. A committee (the “Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee”) shall be established as follows: 

^^Designation and Qualifications. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall consist of a majority of Directors designated for nomination by the Significant Stockholder and at least one Independent Director. Any vacancy on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that results from one of such individuals’ (or his or her successor’s) resignation or removal from the Board or death shall be filled by the successor on the Board to such individual, or, if there is no successor or the vacancy results from another reason, by a majority of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then in office or by the sole remaining member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 

^^Powers and Actions. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall have the power and authority to nominate persons for election to the Board as described in Section 3.4(B) of the By-laws. All out of pocket costs and expenses ([[Battery]]luding attorneys’ fees) [[Battery]]urred by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee pursuant to this Section 6.3(b) shall be paid or reimbursed by the Corporation. 

^Limitation of Liability. To the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, no Director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or the stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any repeal or amendment of this Article 7 or by changes in Law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Certificate [[Battery]]onsistent with this Article 7, will, unless otherwise required by Law, be prospective only, and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection of a Director existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such [[Battery]]onsistent provision in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such [[Battery]]onsistent provision. 

^Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. 

^^Right to Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (a “Covered Person”) who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation or, while a Director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another entity or enterprise, [[Battery]]luding service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses ([[Battery]]luding attorneys’ fees) reasonably [[Battery]]urred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.3, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in advance by the Board. 

^^Advancement of Expenses. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, the Corporation shall pay the expenses ([[Battery]]luding attorneys’ fees) [[Battery]]urred by a Covered Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable Law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article 8 or otherwise. 

^^Claims. 

^^To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, if a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article 8 is not paid in full within 30 days after a written claim therefor by the Covered Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, in any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable Law. 

^^In any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not a suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses hereunder), it shall be a defense that the Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification has not met any applicable standard for indemnification under applicable Law. With respect to any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or right to advancement of expenses hereunder or any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses (whether pursuant to the terms of an undertaking or otherwise), neither (i) the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to commencement of such suit that indemnification of such Covered Person is proper in the circumstances because such Covered Person has met the applicable standards of conduct under applicable Law, nor (ii) an actual determination by the Corporation that such Covered Person has not met such applicable standards of conduct, shall create a presumption that such Covered Person has not met the applicable standards of conduct or, in a case brought by such Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification, be a defense to such suit. 

^^In any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses (whether pursuant to the terms of an undertaking or otherwise), the burden shall be on the Corporation to prove that the Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses or the Covered Person from whom the Corporation seeks to recover an advancement of expenses is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such an advancement of expenses, under this Article 8 or otherwise. 

^^Nonexclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Article 8 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate or the By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise. 

^^Other Sources. The Corporation’s obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another entity or enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person actually collects as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other entity or enterprise; provided, however, that no Covered Person shall be required to seek recovery from any other entity or enterprise. 

^^Amendment or Repeal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any repeal or amendment of this Article 8 by changes in Law (or otherwise), or the adoption of any other provision of this Certificate [[Battery]]onsistent with this Article 8, will, unless otherwise required by Law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in Law permits the Corporation to provide broader rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection of a Covered Person existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such [[Battery]]onsistent provision in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such [[Battery]]onsistent provision, regardless of when the applicable action, suit or proceeding in respect of which such right or protection is sought is commenced and regardless of when such right or protection is sought. 

^^Other Indemnification and Prepayment of Expenses. This Article 8 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by applicable Law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action. 

^Section 203. The Corporation shall not be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL. 

^Adoption, Amendment or Repeal of By-Laws. Subject to the limitations set forth in the By-laws, the Board is authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the By-laws; provided, that no action by the Board to repeal or amend Section 2.3(B), Section 3.2, Section 3.4(B), Section 8.7, Article IV or Article VII of the By-laws (or any definition contained in Article I of the By-laws that is used in any such Section or Article of the By-laws), or the adoption of any other provision of the By-laws [[Battery]]onsistent with such Sections and Articles, shall be effective (a) without the approval of a majority of the Board and a majority of the Special Nominating Committee, if the Special Nominating Committee exists, and (b) at any time when the Special Nominating Committee does not exist, without the approval of a majority of the Board and a majority of the Independent Directors then serving. In addition, and without limiting the authority of the Board to amend the By-laws, any amendment to Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.4(B) or Article VII of the By-laws by stockholders must receive the vote of stockholders holding (i) a majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities and (ii) a majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities not held by a Significant Stockholder or any member of a Restricted Group. 

^Purchase Rights. 

^^General. Each Eligible Stockholder and each Affiliate of an Eligible Stockholder to which an Eligible Stockholder assigns its rights under this Article 11 (each Eligible Stockholder and any such Affiliate being a “Rights Holder”), has the right to purchase such Rights Holder’s Pro Rata Share (as defined in this Section 11.1), of all or any part of any New Securities (as defined in Section 11.2), that the Corporation or its subsidiaries may from time to time issue after the date of this Certificate. A Rights Holder’s “Pro Rata Share” for purposes of this right is the ratio of (a) the number of shares of the Common Stock owned by such Rights Holder on the date of the New Securities Notice (as defined in Section 11.3(a)) to (b) the sum of the total number of shares of the Common Stock then outstanding. 

^^New Securities. For purposes of this Article 11, “New Securities” means (a) any debt instruments of the Corporation or its subsidiaries issued to any Eligible Stockholder or other Affiliate of the Corporation, (b) Capital Stock, whether now authorized or not, (c) equity securities of the Corporation’s subsidiaries, (d) rights, options or warrants to purchase such Capital Stock, equity securities or debt instruments and (e) securities of any type whatsoever that are, or may become, convertible into, exercisable for or exchangeable into such Capital Stock, equity securities or debt instruments; provided, however, that the term “New Securities” does not [[Battery]]lude securities issued or issuable: 

^^to officers, directors, employees, or consultants of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (or to Persons who at the time of the grant were officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries) pursuant to an equity [[Battery]]entive plan or stock purchase plan or agreement on terms approved by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board ([[Battery]]luding securities issued or issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such securities in accordance with the provisions of such plan or agreement); 

^^in connection with a stock split (or reverse stock split), subdivision, conversion, recapitalization, reclassification, dividend or distribution in respect of Capital Stock; 

^^pursuant to a registration statement required to be filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or, if applicable, any debt securities issued or issuable pursuant to an offering made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act; 

^^as consideration for the acquisition of another Person by the Corporation by consolidation, merger, purchase of all or substantially all of the assets or other reorganization in which the Corporation acquires, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, one or more divisions or lines of business or all or substantially all of the assets of such other Person or [[Percentage 2: Number]]% or more of the voting power of such other Person or [[Percentage 2]]% or more of the equity ownership of such other Person; 

^^upon exercise of any convertible securities or in connection with payment-in-kind interest; 

^^as any right, option or warrant to acquire any securities specifically excluded from the definition of New Securities, pursuant to subsections (a) through (e); or 

^^securities issued or issuable pursuant to (i) the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of [[Date 2]], by and among the Corporation, [[Merger Subsidiaries]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]], Grill Merger Corp., a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]], Spectrum Brands, [[Battery]], a Delaware corporation, and [[RH]], [[Battery]], a Delaware corporation, as the same may be amended or modified (the “Merger Agreement”), (ii) the Harbinger Support Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement), as the same may be amended or modified, or (iii) the Stockholder Agreement, as the same may be amended or modified. 

^^Procedure. 

^^The Corporation will give each Rights Holder at least ten (10) days prior written notice of the Corporation’s intention to issue New Securities (the “New Securities Notice”), describing the type and amount of New Securities to be issued and the price and the general terms and conditions upon which the Corporation proposes to issue such New Securities. Each Rights Holder may purchase any or all of such Rights Holder’s Pro Rata Share of such New Securities, by delivering to the Corporation, within ten (10) days after the date of receipt by the Rights Holder of any such New Securities Notice, a written notice specifying such number of New Securities which such Rights Holder desires to purchase, for the price and upon the general terms and conditions specified in the New Securities Notice. If any Rights Holder fails to notify the Corporation in writing within such ten (10) day period of its election to purchase any or all of such Rights Holder’s full Pro Rata Share of an offering of New Securities (a “Nonpurchasing Holder”), then such Nonpurchasing Holder will forfeit the right hereunder to purchase that part of such Rights Holder’s Pro Rata Share of such New Securities that such Rights Holder did not agree to purchase. 

^^If any Rights Holder fails to elect to purchase the full amount of such Rights Holder’s Pro Rata Share of the New Securities, the Corporation shall give notice (“Purchasing Holders Notice”) of such failure to the Rights Holders who did so elect (the “Purchasing Holders”). Such Purchasing Holders Notice may be made by telephone if confirmed in writing within two (2) days. A Purchasing Holder shall have five (5) days from the date such Purchasing Holders Notice was received by such Purchasing Holder to notify the Corporation in writing of its election (“Purchasing Holders Election”) to purchase its pro rata portion of the total number of New Securities available for purchase by Rights Holders pursuant to Section 11.1 not subscribed for by the Nonpurchasing Holders. Each Purchasing Holder’s pro rata portion thereof shall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Purchasing Holder on the date of the New Securities Notice, as a percentage of the total number of shares of Common Stock held by all Purchasing Holders on the date of the New Securities Notice. 

^^If, subsequent to the procedure set forth in this Section 11.3, there shall be New Securities available for purchase by Rights Holders pursuant to Section 11.1 hereof that have not been purchased by the Purchasing Holders, the Corporation shall repeat the procedure set forth in Section 11.3(b), as many times as necessary, until it has been determined that none of the Purchasing Holders has made a Purchasing Holders Election pursuant to the procedure set forth in this Section 11.3. 

^^Failure to Exercise. In the event that the Rights Holders fail to exercise in full the purchase right with respect to all of the offered New Securities described in the New Securities Notice, then the Corporation will have sixty (60) days after a determination has been made pursuant to the last clause of Section 11.3(c) to issue the New Securities with respect to which the Rights Holders’ rights hereunder were not exercised, at a price and upon terms and conditions not more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in the New Securities 

Notice to the Rights Holders. In the event that the Corporation has not issued such New Securities within such sixty (60) day period, then the Corporation shall not thereafter issue such New Securities without again first offering such New Securities to the Rights Holders pursuant to this Article 11.
