Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, to the extent (i) a severance payment under this Policy is determined by the Company to be subject to Section 409A and (ii) is to be made to a Specified Employee who would be subject to a penalty tax under Section 409A, any such severance payment shall be made by the Company on the first day of the seventh month following the effective date of such Covered Employee's termination.

^Benefits

^Policy Changes

The Company reserves the right to amend or modify this Policy at any time without prior notice, provided that, without the written approval of any affected Covered Employee, no such amendment or modification made subsequent to the occurrence of a Change of Control shall alter or impair the benefits that might be payable to a Covered Employee hereunder as a result of a termination of employment following such Change of Control. This Policy will also change from time to time as the terms and phrases used in this Policy are modified by rule or law.

^Interpretation

The Compensation Committee shall administer and interpret this Policy. This Policy is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A, if and to the extent that the benefits payable pursuant to this Policy do not qualify for any applicable exception to those provisions. The provisions of this Policy shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the applicable requirements of Section 409A and any rules or regulations issued pursuant thereto, including without limitation, the requirement in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) that payments subject to Section 409A made on account of a separation from service to a "specified employee," as defined therein, not be made before the date which is six (6) months after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of the specified employee's death).

^Claims Procedure

In the event that any Covered Employee or his or her beneficiary claims to be entitled to benefits under this Policy or believes his or her benefits are incorrect, that Covered Employee or his or her beneficiary (hereafter, a "Claimant") may file a claim for benefits by submitting a written statement describing the basis of the claim for benefits under this Policy. The Compensation Committee shall review the claim and respond within a reasonable period of time, but no more than 90 days after receipt of the claim by the Compensation Committee.

If the Compensation Committee makes an adverse determination as to the Claimant's claim, the Compensation Committee shall, within the time period described above, notify the Claimant in a writing setting forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant:

^^^the specific reasons for the adverse determination,

^^^the provisions of this Policy on which the determination is based,

^^^a description of additional information or material necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such additional information or material is necessary, and

^^^a description of this Policy's review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the Claimant's right to bring suit under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.

Within 60 days of receipt by a Claimant of a notice denying a claim, the Claimant, or his or her duly authorized representative, may request in writing a full and fair review of the claim by filing an appeal with the Compensation Committee. In connection with such appeal, the Claimant or his or her duly authorized representative:

^^^may submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for benefits, and

^^^shall be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the Claimant's claim for benefits.

The Compensation Committee shall provide for a full and fair review that takes into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the Claimant's written presentation, as well as any evidence, facts or circumstances the Compensation Committee deems relevant.

The Compensation Committee shall make a decision not later than 60 days after the Compensation Committees receipt of a request for appeal.
