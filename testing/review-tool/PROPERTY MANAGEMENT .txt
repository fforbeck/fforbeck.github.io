^Manager shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Owner, and its direct and indirect, members, partners, directors, officers, managers, employees, agents and Affiliates (each, an “**Owner Indemnified Party**”) from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements (“**Damages**”) (including Damages relating to violations of Legal Requirements), arising out or resulting from the acts or omissions of Manager and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors and agents, which constitute gross negligence, fraud, malfeasance, breach of fiduciary duty, willful, reckless or criminal misconduct, a breach of this Agreement, or any actions of Manager (or its Affiliates) beyond the scope of the authority conferred upon Manager hereunder.

Manager shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all Contracts made hereunder contain a provision satisfactory to Owner limiting the liability of Owner thereunder to the Property substantially similar to the following:

“Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, [Contractor/Vendor] shall look solely to the estate and property of Owner in and to the Property in the event of any claim against Owner arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the relationship of Owner and [Contractor/Vendor]. [Contractor/Vendor] further agrees that the liability of Owner arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, and the relationship of Owner and [Contractor/Vendor], shall be limited to such estate and property of Owner in and to the Property.

In the event of any such notice, condition, default or event of default, Manager shall consult with Owner concerning the action to be taken with respect thereto and, at the expense of Owner, shall take such action with respect thereto as Owner shall reasonably direct. As used herein, “**Legal Requ irements**” shall mean, with respect to the Property, all federal, state, county, municipal and other governmental statutes, laws, rules, orders, regulations, ordinances, judgments, decrees and injunctions of governmental authorities affecting the Property or any part thereof, or the construction, use, alteration or operation thereof, or any part thereof, whether now or hereafter enacted and in force, and all permits, licenses and authorizations and regulations relating thereto, and all covenants, agreements, restrictions and encumbrances contained in any instruments, either of record or known to Borrower, at any time in force affecting the Property or any part thereof, including, without limitation, any which may (a) require repairs, modifications or alterations in or to the Property or any part thereof, or (b) in any way limit the use and enjoyment thereof.

^As long as the failure to promptly comply with any notice concerning any Legal Requirement or Insurance Requirement shall not subject Manager to any liability, Owner may stay Manager’s remedial action with respect to such notice by instituting, or directing Manager to institute, appropriate legal or other proceedings to contest such notice, all at Owner’s sole expense. In the event Owner directs Manager to institute such proceedings to contest such notice, Manager is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and file all applications and other documents required for such proceedings on Owner’s behalf and in Owner’s name. Manager shall promptly furnish to Owner copies of all such applications and other documents prepared, executed or filed by Manager.

^Manager may appear in or commence legal or other proceedings on behalf of Owner in Owner’s name only upon the direction of Owner, it being understood that Owner will pay any costs and fees, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, in connection therewith.
