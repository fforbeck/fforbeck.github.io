Payment Date occurring on [[Date 10: Date]], Borrowers shall pay to Lender the sum of $[[USD Value 6: Number]], which amounts shall be deposited with and held by Lender for payment or reimbursement of Gas Company Tenant Improvement Allowances. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the event that the Gas Company does not exercise its option to add the additional “Hold Space” as provided in Section 1.2 of the Gas Company Lease on or before [[Date 11: Date]] (and, as a result, the Gas Company’s option to add the additional “Hold Space” expires and is of no further force and effect, as evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate from Borrowers), then beginning on the Payment Date occurring on [[Date 9]], and on each Payment Date thereafter, through and including the Payment Date occurrin g on [[Date 10]], Borrowers shall (instead of the $[[USD Value 6]] set forth in the immediately preceding sentence) pay to Lender the sum of $[[USD Value 7: Number]], which amounts shall be deposited with and held by Lender for payment or reimbursement of Gas Company Tenant Improvement Allowances.

^^Beginning on the Payment Date occurring on [[Date 12: Date]], and on each Payment Date thereafter, Borrowers shall pay to Lender the sum of $[[USD Value 8: Number]], which amounts shall be deposited with and held by Lender for the “Mid-Term Allowance” (as defined in the Gas Company Lease).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.8.1(b), the payments set forth in this Section 7.8.1(b) shall not be required during any period of “Free Rent” (as defined in the Gas Company Lease). For the avoidance of doubt, Borrowers and Lender hereby agree that the relevant “Free Rent” periods shall be the month of [[Date 13: Date]] and the period starting with the month of [[Date 14: Date]] and running through the month of [[Date 15: Date]].

^^All amounts deposited with Lender under this Section 7.8.1 shall hereinafter be referred to as the “**Gas Company TI Allowance Reserve Funds**” and the account in which such amounts are held shall hereinafter be referred to as the “**Gas Company TI Allowance Reserve Account**”. Gas Company TI Allowance Reserve Funds shall be disbursed and applied by Lender from time to time in accordance with Section 7.8.2 hereof.

7.8.2 **Withdrawal of Gas Company TI Allowance Reserve Funds.**

^^Provided that no Event of Default shall exist and remain uncured, then beginning on the Payment Date occurring in [[Date 16: Date]] (or earlier, if Gas Company has exercised its right to early disbursement of the Gas Company Tenant Improvement Allowances pursuant to Section 3.3 of Exhibit D to the Gas Company Lease, but in no event prior to [[Date 17: Date]]) Lender shall make disbursements from the Gas Company TI Allowance Reserve Funds (in no event in excess of the amount then on deposit in the Gas Company TI Allowance Reserve Account) collected pursuant to Section 7.8.1(a) above for the payment or reimbursement of Gas Company Tenant    
Improvement Allowances paid by Tower Borrower pursuant to Section 3.1 of Exhibit D to the Gas Company Lease, as requested in writing by Borrowers, no more frequently than once per calendar month, in increments of no less than $[[USD Value 10: Number]], within five (5) Business Days after delivery by Borrowers of Lender’s standard form of draw request accompanied by: (a) copies of invoices furnished to Tower Borrower by Gas Company for work or labor performed and materials or supplies, together with any certificate provided by Gas Company’s designer, architect or engineer certifying that the work and materials have been furnished as indicated in such invoice, (b) an Officer’s Certificate for each Borrower (i) stating that the items to be funded by the requested disbursement are Gas Company Tenant Improvemen t Allowances, and a description thereof, (ii) stating that all tenant improvements at the applicable Property to be funded by the requested disbursement have been performed in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements and the terms of the Gas Company Lease, (iii) identifying each Person that supplied materials or labor in connection with the tenant improvements to be funded by the requested disbursement, (iv) stating that each such Person has been paid in full or will be paid in full upon such disbursement for work or services completed and/or materials furnished, and invoiced, (v) stating that the Gas Company Tenant Improvement Allowances to be funded have not been the subject of a previous disbursement, (vi) stating that all previous disbursements of Gas Company TI Allowance Reserve Funds have been used to pay the previously identified Gas Company Tenant Improvement Allowances, and (vii) stating that all outstanding Gas Company Tenant Improvement Allowances that have been requested by Gas Company, in accordance with the Gas Company Lease have been paid in full or will be paid for in full from the requested disbursement, (c) any verification, reports and lien waivers and releases (conditional and unconditional as appropriate), if applicable, or other evidence of payment satisfactory to Lender and the Title Company from all contractors, subcontractors and materialmen furnishing materials and/or services in connection with the requested payment, and (d) such other evidence as Lender shall reasonably request to demonstrate that the Gas Company Tenant Improvement Allowances to be funded by the requested disbursement have been completed and are paid for or will be paid upon such disbursement to Borrowers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any of the documentation set forth in the foregoing sentence is obtainable only from Gas Company, and the Gas Company is not required to provide such documentation to Tower Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Gas Company Lease (and does not in fact provide such documentation to Tower Borrower) (any such documentation, an “**Undeliverable Item**”), then Borrowers shall, in lieu of such Undeliverable Item, submit an Officer’s Certificate (i) specifically describing such Undeliverable Item, (ii) certifying that such Undeliverable Item is obtainable only from Gas Company, (iii) certifying that Gas Company is not required to provide such Undeliverable Item pursuant to the terms of the Gas Company Lease, (iv) certifying that Tower Borrower has nonetheless requested such Undeliverable Item and used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the same, and (v) certifying that pursuant to the terms of the Gas Company Lease, Tower Borrower is unconditionally obligated to pay the applicable Gas Company Tenant Improvement Allowances to the Gas Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.8.2(a), the parties hereby acknowledge that, pursuant to Section 3.1 of Exhibit D to the Gas Company Lease, subject to the conditions set forth in the Gas Company Lease, Gas 

Company shall be entitled to receive as a cash payment any remaining undisbursed amounts of the Gas Company Tenant Improvement Allowances that are not disbursed within six (6) months after the “Commencement Date” (as defined in the Gas Company Lease), and therefore such disbursement of remaining amounts of the Gas Company Tenant Improvement Allowances (if any) may not pertain to specific improvement costs incurred by Gas Company. Any disbursement by Lender hereunder in excess of $[[USD Value 10]] and not already paid for by Borrowers shall be made by joint check, payable to Borrowers and Gas Company (or the applicable party designated by Gas Company, to whom payment is due in connection with such disbursement). Lender may require an inspection of the Gas Company Space at Borrowers’ expense prior t o making a disbursement in order to verify compliance with the requirements of this Section 7.8.2. Within ten (10) Business Days following the disbursement of the final Gas Company Tenant Improvement Allowances payment to Borrowers, Borrowers shall furnish to Lender a written confirmation from Gas Company, confirming that the entire “Tenant Improvement Allowance” (as defined in the Gas Company Lease) has been paid in full by Borrowers. Following such written confirmation, any amounts remaining in the Gas Company TI Allowance Reserve Account collected pursuant to Section 7.8.1(a) hereof (if any) shall be transferred to the Rollover Reserve Account, and held by Lender as Rollover Reserve Funds, provided, however, that if Borrowers so request, in writing and simultaneously with the furnishing of such written confirmation, Lender shall instead transfe r such amounts (if any) to the Debt Service Reserve Account and such funds shall be held as Debt Service Reserve Funds. For the avoidance of doubt, no such transfer to the Debt Service Reserve Account shall reduce or offset any future obligation of Borrowers to make deposits into the Debt Service Reserve Account pursuant to Section 7.9.1 hereof.

^^Amounts collected by Lender pursuant to Section 7.8.1(b) above, shall be held, subject to Section 7.7(a) hereof, by Lender for the payment of the “Mid-Term Allowance” (as defined in the Gas Company Lease), and Borrowers shall not be entitled to any disbursements of such amounts, provided that on the Maturity Date, if the Loan and any other amounts then due are repaid in full and the Borrowers otherwise perform in full all Obligations, and provided that no Default or Event of Default then exists, then Borrowers shall be entitled, upon request and at their expense, to the ret urn, in accordance with Section 5.4 of the Cash Management Agreement, of any funds collected pursuant to Section 7.8.1(b) above and not yet disbursed or applied by Lender. For the avoidance of doubt, funds held in the Gas Company TI Allowance Reserve Account shall not be available to pay any “Expansion Space Allowance” (as defined in the Gas Company Lease).”

^^^The following provisions are hereby added to the Loan Agreement as Section 7.9 thereof:

“Section 7.9 **Debt Service Reserve Funds**.

7.9.1 **Deposits to the Debt Service Reserve Funds**. Beginning on the Payment Date occurring on [[Date 9]], and on each Payment Date thereafter, through and including the Payment Date occurring on [[Date 18: Date]], Borrowers shall pay to 

Lender the sum of $[[USD Value 11: Number]], which amounts shall be deposited with and held by Lender for shortfalls in the payment of Debt Service and other amounts due to Lender under the Loan Documents. All such amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as the “**Debt Service Reserve Funds**” and the account in which such amounts are held shall hereinafter be referred to as the “**Debt Service Reserve Account**”. Debt Service Reserve Funds shall be disbursed and applied by Lender from time to time in accordance with Section 7.9.2 hereof.

7.9.2 **Withdrawal of Debt Service Reserve Funds.** Provided that no Event of Default shall exist and remain uncured, to the extent that the Cash Management Account does not contain sufficient funds to pay the monthly Debt Service payment in full, together with any payments required to be made to any Reserve Funds and any other amounts then due and payable to Lender on any Payment Date, the Debt Service Reserve Funds shall be applied in an amount determined by Lender (which determination by Lender shall be final), necessary to pay in full any monthly Debt Service payment and any other amounts due to Lender and payable on such Payment Date. & #160;Borrowers agree and acknowledge that the insufficiency of funds then on deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Account shall not relieve or otherwise limit Borrowers’ obligation to pay any Debt Service payment, any payments required to be made to any Reserve Funds or any other amounts then due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.”

^**Other Provisions Regarding the Loan Agreement**.

^^Without in any way limiting Borrower’s obligations under the Loan Agreement, Borrower hereby covenants and agrees: (i) to forward to Lender, immediately upon receipt, copies of any notices delivered by Gas Company under Section 9.3 of the Gas Company Lease; (ii) that any failure to make repairs and/or perform maintenance in a timely manner that Borrower is required to make and/or perform under the Gas Company Lease, shall constitute an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(xiv) of the Loan Agreement (subject to any applicable notice and cure periods set forth therein); (iii) to forward to Lender, immediately upon receipt, copies of any invoices delivered by Gas Company under Section 9.3 of t he Gas Company Lease; (iv) that any failure by Borrower, within the time period set forth in the Gas Company Lease, to either pay such invoices or deliver to Gas Company a detailed written objection as set forth in the Gas Company Lease, shall constitute an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(xiv) of the Loan Agreement (subject to any applicable notice and cure periods set forth therein); and (v) any failure by Borrower to pay an initial judgment in favor Gas Company, as set forth in the second paragraph of Section 9.3 of the Gas Company Lease, shall constitute an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(xiv) of the Loan Agreement (subject to any applicable notice and cure periods set forth therein) unless Borrower is then diligently pursuing an appeal of such initial judgment. Without in any way limiting Borrower’s obligations under the Loan Agreement, Borrower hereby further acknowledges and agrees that any failure by Borrower to pay any leasing commission or broker 217;s commission in connection with the Gas Company Lease, as and when due, shall constitute an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(xiv) of the Loan Agreement (subject to any applicable notice and cure periods set forth therein).

For the sake of clarity and avoidance of doubt, the Borrowers may request disbursements from the Rollover Rese rve to pay leasing commissions and/or broker’s commissions (if any) payable in connection with any expansion right (other than the “Hold Space Option,” as defined in the Amended Lease) or right of first refusal on vacant space (if any) pursuant to the Amended Lease, to the extent such leasing commissions and/or broker’s commissions otherwise satisfy the definition of Approved Leasing Expenses.
