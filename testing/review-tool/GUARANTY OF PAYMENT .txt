^Guaranty Unconditional.

The obligations and liabilities of the Guarantor under this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the genuineness, validity, priority, regularity or enforceability of the Financing Agreement, any promissory note evidencing all or any part of the Obligations, or any of the other Financing Documents or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor. The Guarantor expressly agrees that the Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion, without notice to or further assent of the Guarantor and without in any way releasing, affecting or in any way impairing the obligations and liabilities of the Guarantor hereunder:

^^^^ \centered (b) modify, amend, change or terminate any provisions of any of the Financing Documents;

The obligations and liabilities of the Guarantor under this Agreement shall be primary, direct and immediate, shall not be subject to any counterclaim, recoupment, setoff, reduction or defense based upon any claim that the Guarantor may have against the Borrower, the Lender and/or any other guarantor and shall not be conditional or contingent upon pursuit or enforcement by the Lender of any remedies it may have against the Borrower with respect to any promissory note evidencing all or any part of the Obligations or any of the other Financing Documents, whether pursuant to the terms thereof or by operation of law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lender shall not be required to make any demand upon the Borrower, or to sell the Collateral or otherwise pursue, enforce or exhaust its remedies against the Borrower or the Collateral either before, concurrently with or after pursuing or enforcing its rights and remedies hereunder. Any one or more successive or concurrent actions or proceedings may be brought against the Guarantor under this Agreement, either in the same action, if any, brought against the Borrower or in separate actions or proceedings, as often as the Lender may deem expedient or advisable. Without limiting the foregoing, it is specifically understood that any modification, limitation or discharge of any of the liabilities or obligations of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any obligor under any of the Financing Documents, arising out of, or by virtue of, any bankruptcy, arrangement, reorganization or similar proceeding for relief of debtors under federal or state law initiated by or against the Borrower or the Guarantor or any obligor under any of the Financing Documents shall not modify, limit, lessen, reduce, impair, discharge, or otherwise affect the liability of the Guarantor hereunder in any manner whatsoever, and this Agreement shall remain and continue in full force and effect. It is the intent and purpose of this Agreement that the Guarantor shall and does hereby waive all rights and benefits which might accrue to any other guarantor by reason of any such proceeding, and the Guarantor agrees that it shall be liable for the full amount of the obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, regardless of, and irrespective to, any modification, limitation or discharge of the liability of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any obligor under any of the Financing Documents, that may result from any such proceedings.

^^^^ \centered (b) Any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or in any report, statement, schedule, certificate, opinion (including any opinion of counsel for the Guarantor), financial statement or other document furnished in connection with this Agreement, shall prove to have been false or misleading when made (or, if applicable, when reaffirmed) in any material respect.    

^^^^ \centered (c) The failure of the Guarantor to perform, observe or comply with any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement. 

^^^^ \centered (d) A Default shall occur under any of the other Financing Documents and such Default is not cured within any applicable grace period provided therein.

^Subordination; Subrogation.

In the event the Guarantor shall advance any sums to the Borrower, or in the event the Borrower has heretofore or shall hereafter become indebted to the Guarantor before the Obligations have been paid in full, all such advances and indebtedness shall be subordinate in all respects to the Obligations (the “Guarantor Subordinated Debt”). Any payment to the Guarantor on account of the Guarantor Subordinated Debt shall be collected and received by the Lender or the Guarantor in trust for the Lender and shall be paid over to the Lender on account of the Obligations without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder.

Without the prior written consent of the Lender, the Guarantor shall not ask, demand, receive, accept, sue for, set off, collect or enforce the Guarantor Subordinated Debt or any collateral and security therefor. The Guarantor represents and warrants to the Lender that the Guarantor Subordinated Debt is unsecured and agrees not to receive or accept any collateral or security therefor without the prior written permission of the Lender. The Guarantor shall not assign, transfer, hypothecate or dispose of the Guarantor Subordinated Debt while this Agreement is in effect. In the event of any sale, receivership, insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or any proceeding by or against the Borrower for any relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other laws relating to the relief of debtors, readjustment of indebtedness, reorganizations, compositions or extensions, then and in any such event any payment or distribution of any kind or character, either in cash, securities or other property, which shall be payable or deliverable upon, or with respect to, all or any part of the Guarantor Subordinated Debt or otherwise shall be paid or delivered directly to the Lender for application to the obligations and liabilities of the Guarantor under this Agreement (whether due or not due and in such order and manner as the Lender may determine in the exercise of its sole discretion) until the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall have been fully paid and satisfied. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers the Lender to demand, sue for, collect and receive every such payment or distribution on account of the Guarantor Subordinated Debt and give acquittance therefor and to file claims and take such other proceedings in the Lender’s own name or in the name of the Guarantor or otherwise, as the Lender may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the provisions of this Agreement. The Guarantor hereby agrees to execute and deliver to the Lender such powers of attorney, assignments, endorsements or other instruments as may be requested by the Lender in order to enable the Lender to enforce any and all claims upon, or with respect to, the Guarantor Subordinated Debt, and to collect and receive any and all payments or distributions which may be payable or deliverable at any time upon or with respect thereto.

So as to secure the performance by the Guarantor of the provisions of this Agreement, the Guarantor assigns, pledges and grants to the Lender a security interest in, and lien on, the Guarantor Subordinated Debt, all proceeds thereof and all and any security and collateral therefor. Upon the request of the Lender, the Guarantor shall endorse, assign and deliver to the Lender all notes, instruments and agreements evidencing, securing, guarantying or made in connection with the Guarantor Subordinated Debt.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to give the Guarantor any right of subrogation in or to the Obligations or any of the Financing Documents, or all or any part of the interest of the Lender therein, until the Obligations have been paid in full.
