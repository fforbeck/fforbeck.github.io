As used herein, the terms "parent" and "subsidiary" mean "parent corporation" and "subsidiary corporation", respectively, as those terms are defined in Section 424 of the Code.

^**Administration of the Plan**  
^**Board or Committee Administration****.** The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") or by a Committee appointed by the Board pursuant to Section 2B of the Plan. Hereinafter, all references in this Plan to the "Committee" shall mean the Board if no Committee has been appointed. Subject to ratification of the grant or authorization of each Option by the Board (if so required by applicable state law), and subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committ ee shall have the authority to (i) determine the employees of the Company and Related Corporations (from among the class of employees eligible under paragraph 3 to receive ISOs) to whom ISOs may be granted, and to determine (from among the class of individuals and entities eligible under paragraph 3 to receive Non-Qualified Options) to whom Non-Qualified Options may be granted; (ii) determine the time or times at which Options may be granted; (iii) determine the option price of shares subject to each Option, which price shall not be less than the minimum price specified in paragraph 6; (iv) determine, with respect to each Option granted under the Plan, whether such Option shall be an ISO or a Non-Qualified Option; (v) determine (subject to paragraph 7) the time or times when each Option shall become exercisable and the duration of the exercise period; (vi) determine whether restrictions such as repurchase options are to be imposed on shares subject to Options and the nature of such restrictions, if any, and (vii) interpret the Plan and prescribe and rescind rules and regulations relating to it. If the Committee determines to issue a Non-Qualified Option, it shall take whatever actions it deems necessary, under Section 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, to ensure that such Option is not treated as an ISO. If the Committee determines to issue an ISO, it shall take whatever actions it deems necessary, under Section 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, to ensure that such Option is not treated as a Non-Qualified Option. The interpretation and construction by the Committee of any provisions of the Plan or of any Option granted under it shall be final unless otherwise determined by the Board. The Committee may from time to time adopt such rules and regulations for carrying out the Plan as it may deem best. No member of the Board or the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Option granted under it.

^The Board may delegate administration of the Plan to a Committee composed of not fewer than two (2) Directors (the "Committee"), each of the members of which Committee shall be (i) a Non-Employee Director (as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3(b)(3)(i)) and (ii) an “outside director” (within the meaning of such term Section 1562(m) of the Code. If administration is delegated to a Committee, the Committee shall have, in connection with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board, subject, however, to such resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted form time to time by the Board.

^Any requirement that each member of the Committee be a "Non-Employee Director" shall not apply (i) after the date the Company ceases to have any class of equity security registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or (ii) if the Board expressly declares that such requirement shall not apply.

^**Eligible Employees and Others****.** ISOs may be granted to any employee of the Company or any Related Corporation. Those officers and directors of the Company who are not employees may not be granted ISOs under the Plan. Non-Qualified Options may he granted to any employee, officer or director (including Non-Employee Directors) or consultant of the Company or any Related Corporation. The Committee may take into consideration a recipient's individual circumstances in determining whether to grant an ISO or a Non-Qualified Option. Granting of any Options to any individual or entity shall neither entitle that individual or entity to, nor disqualify him from, participation in any other grants of Options.

^**Stock****.** The stock subject to Options shall be authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), or shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company in any manner. The aggregate number of shares which may be issued pursuant to the Plan is 6,000,000, subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph 13. Any such shares may be issued as ISOs or Non-Qualified Options so long as the number of shares so issued does not exceed such num ber, as adjusted. If any Option granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate for any reason without having been exercised in full or shall cease for any reason to be exercisable in whole or in part, the unpurchased shares subject to such Options shall again be available for grants of Option under the Plan. The number of shares of Common Stock in respect of which an optionee may receive Options under the Plan in any year shall not exceed 500,000, subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph 13.

^**Granting of Options****.** Options may be granted under the Plan at any time after [[Date 2: Date]] and prior to [[Date 3: Date]]. The date of grant of Options under the Plan will be the date specified by the Committee at the time it grants the Option; provided, however, that such date shall not be prior to the date on which the Committee acts to approve the grant. The Committee shall have the right, with the consent of the optionee, to convert an ISO granted under the Plan to a Non-Qualifie d Option pursuant to paragraph 16.

^**Minimum Option Price; ISO Limitation**  
^**Price for Non-Qualified Options****.** The exercise price per share specified in the agreement relating to each Non-Qualified Option granted under the Plan shall in no event be less than the minimum legal consideration required therefor under the laws of the State of Delaware or the laws of any jurisdiction in which the Company or its successors in interest may be organized.

^**Price for ISOs****.** The exercise price per share specified in the agreement relating to each ISO granted under the Plan shall not be lessthan the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the date of such grant. In the case of an ISO to be granted to an employee owning stock possessing more than ten percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Related Corporation, the pric e per share specified in the agreement relating to such ISO shall not be less than one hundred ten percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the date of grant.

^**$[[USD Value 1: Number]] Annual Limitation on ISOs****.** Each eligible employee may be granted ISOs only to the extent that, in the aggregate under this Plan and all incentive stock option plans of the Company and any Related Corporation, the value of Common Stock (determined at the time ISOs were granted) which is subject to ISOs that become exercisable for the first time by such employee during any calendar year does not exceed $[[USD Value 2: Number]] Any options granted to an employee in excess of such amount will be granted as Non-Qualified Options.

^**Determination of Fair Value Market****.** If, at the time an Option is granted under the Plan, the Company's Common Stock is publicly traded, "fair market value" shall be determined as of the last business day for which the prices or quotes discussed in this sentence are available prior to the date such Option is granted and shall mean (i) the average (on that date) of the high and low prices of the Common Stock on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is tra ded, if the Common Stock is then traded on a national securities exchange; or (ii) the last reported sale price (on that date) of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market (or successor trading system), if the Common Stock is not then traded on a national securities exchange; or (iii) the closing bid price (or average of bid prices) last quoted (on that date) by an established quotation service for over-the-counter securities, if the Common Stock is not reported on the NASDAQ National Market (or successor trading system). However, if the Common Stock is not publicly traded at the time an Option is granted under the Plan, "fair market value" shall be deemed to be the fair value of the Common Stock as determined by the Committee after taking into consideration all factors which it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, recent sale and offer prices of the Common Stock in private transactions negotiated at arm's length.

^**Option Duration****.** Subject to earlier termination as provided in paragraphs 9 and 10, each Option shall expire on the date specified by the Committee, but not more than (i) ten years and one day from the date of grant in the case of Non-Qualified Options, (ii) ten years from the date of grant in the case of ISOs generally, and (iii) five years from the date of grant in the case of ISOs granted to an employee owning stock possessing more than ten percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the total combined voti ng power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Related Corporation. Subject to earlier termination as provided in paragraphs 9 and 10, the term of each ISO shall be the term set forth in the original instrument granting such ISO, except with respect to any part of such ISO that is converted into a Non-Qualified Option pursuant to paragraph 16.

^**Exercise of Option****.** Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 9 through 12, each Option granted under the Plan shall be exercisable as follows:

^**Vesting****.** The Option shall either be fully exercisable on the date of grant or shall become exercisable thereafter in such installments as the Committee may specify.

^**Full Vesting of Installments****.** Once an installment becomes exercisable it shall remain exercisable until expiration or termination of the Option, unless otherwise specified by the Committee.

^**Partial Exercise****.** Each Option or installment may be exercised at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, for up to the total number of shares with respect to which it is then exercisable.

^**Acceleration of Vesting****.** The Committee shall have the right to accelerate the date of exercise of any installment of any Option; provided that the Committee shall not, without the consent of an optionee, accelerate the exercise date of any installment of any Option granted to any employee as an ISO (and not previously converted into a Non-Qualified Option pursuant to paragraph 16) if such acceleration would violate the annual vesting limitation contained in Section 422(d) of the Code , as described in paragraph 6(C).

^**Extension of Exercise Period****.** Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Committee may, in its discretion, extend the exercise period with respect to any Non-Qualified Option.

^**Termination of Employment****.** If an ISO optionee ceases to be employed by the Company and all Related Corporations other than by reason of death or disability as defined in paragraph 10, no further installments of his ISOs shall become exercisable, and his ISOs shall terminate after the passage of ninety (90) days from the date of termination of his employment (or at such earlier date as may be specified in the optionee’s option agreement), but in no event later than on their spec ified expiration dates, except to the extent that such ISOs (or unexercised installments thereof) have been converted into Non-Qualified Options pursuant to paragraph 16. Employment shall be consideredas continuing uninterrupted during any bona fide leave of absence (such as those attributable to illness, military obligations or governmental service) provided that the period of such leave does not exceed ninety (90) days or, if longer, any period during which such optionee's right to reemployment is guaranteed by statute. A bona fide leave of absence with the written approval of the Committee shall not be considered an interruption of employment under the Plan, provided that such written approval contractually obligates the Company or any Related Corporation to continue the employment of the optionee after the approved period of absence. ISOs granted under the Plan shall not be affected by any change of employment within or among the Company and R elated Corporations, so long as the optionee continues to be an employee of the Company or any Related Corporation. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any grantee of any Option the right to be retained in employment or other service by the Company or any Related Corporation for any period of time.

^**Death; Disability**  
^**Death****.** If an ISO optionee ceases to be employed by the Company and all Related Corporations by reason of his death, any ISO of his may be exercised, to the extent of the number of shares with respect to which he could have exercised it on the date of his death, by his estate, personal representative or beneficiary who has acquired the ISO by will or by the lawsof descent and distribution, at any time prior to the earlier o f the specified expiration date of the ISO or 180 days from the date of the optionee's death.

^**Disability****.** If an ISO optionee ceases to be employed by the Company and all Related Corporations by reason of his disability, he shall have the right to exercise any ISO held by him on the date of termination of employment, to the extent of the number of shares with respect to which he could have exercised it on that date, at any time prior to the earlier of the specified expiration date of the ISO or 180 days from the date of the termination of the optionee's employment. For the pur poses of the Plan, the term "disability" shall mean "permanent and total disability" as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code or successor statute.

^**Assignability****.** No Option shall be assignable or transferable by the optionee except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or, with respect to Non-Qualified Options only, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined in the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder. During the lifetime of the optionee each ISO shall be exercisable only by him. Any assignment or transfer, or attempted assignment or tra nsfer, of an Option in violation of this Section 11 shall be void.

^**Terms and Conditions of Options****.** Options shall be evidenced by instruments (which need not be identical) in such forms as the Committee may from time to time approve. Such instruments shall conform to the terms and conditions set forth in paragraphs 6 through 11 hereof and may contain such other provisions as the Committee deems advisable which arenot inconsistent with the Plan, including restrictions applicable to shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options. In granting any Non-Qualified Option, the Committee may specify that such Non-Qualified option shall be subject to the restrictions set forth herein with respect to ISOs, or to such other termination and cancellation provisions as the Committee may determine. The Committee may from time to time confer authority and responsibility on one or more of its own members and/or one or more officers of the Company to execute and deliver such instruments.

If the Committee determines that such adjustments made wi th respect to ISOs would constitute a modification of such ISOs, it may refrain from making such adjustments.

Such actions may include, but not be limited to, extending the exercise period or reducing the exercise price of the appropriate installments of such ISOs. At the time of such conversion, the Committee (with the consent of the optionee) may impose such conditions on the exercise of the resulting Non-Qualified Options as the Committee in its discretion may determine, provided that such conditions shall not be inconsistent with this Plan. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any optionee the right to have such optionee's ISOs converted into Non-Qualified Options, and no such conversion shall occur until and unless the Committee takes appropriate action. The Committee, with the consent of the optionee, may also terminate any portion of any ISO that has not been exercised at the time of such termination.
