^^^^^ 
Securityholders and Registration Rights Agreement, of any such securities that are not sold pursuant to such Registration Statement, and any such securities that are not so sold will continue to qualify as Registrable Securities (as defined in the Securityholders and Registration Rights Agreement), subject to and in accordance with the Securityholders and Registration Rights Agreement.

Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification ( provided that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is actually and materially prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party;  provided that any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees or expenses, (B) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of such claim from the Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person, (C) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based upon advice of its counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or (D) in the reasonable judgment of any such Person (based upon advice of its counsel) a conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person). No indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation without the prior written consent of such indemnified party. If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its prior written consent, but such consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, except as specifically set forth in this Section 4.03, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements or other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time.

In the event such a “tail” policy is purchased by the Company, the Company will maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its respective obligations thereunder.

SECTION 4.05.  Indemnification Primary Responsibility of the Company. Notwithstanding the fact that certain indemnified parties may have rights to indemnification from one or more Holdings Parties or other Persons with which such indemnified party is associated, the Company shall be fully and primarily responsible for payment to such indemnified parties pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, irrespective of any other right of recovery such indemnified party may have from a Holdings Party or other Person. 

^^^^^ 
Under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to any right of subrogation or contribution by any Holdings Party or other Person and no right of advancement or recovery that the applicable indemnified party may have from a Holdings Party or other Person shall reduce or otherwise alter the rights of such indemnified party or the obligations of the Company hereunder.

SECTION 5.07.  Concerning the Third Party Beneficiaries. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Purchasers are intended to be third party beneficiaries of Section 3.01 and Section 3.02 of this Agreement and a Majority in Interest of the Purchasers has the right to enforce these Sections directly to the extent a Majority in Interest of the Purchasers deems such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect the rights of the Purchasers under Section 3.01 and Section 3.02 of this Agreement.

SECTION 5.08.  Entire Agreement. This Agreement and, to the extent referenced herein, the Stock Purchase Agreement, together with the several agreements and other documents and instruments referred to herein or therein or annexed hereto or thereto, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

SECTION 5.09.  Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement is to be construed in accordance with and governed by the federal law of the United States of America and the internal laws of the State of [[Address 8: Address]] effect to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State of [[Address 9: Address]] rights and duties of the parties. Each of the parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of [[Address 10: Address]] any [[Address 11: Address]] sitting in [[Address 12: Address]] purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

SECTION 5.10.  Amendment; Waiver; Certain Actions Following Dissolution Transactions. This Agreement may not be amended or modified by the parties, except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties (or following completion of the Dissolution Transactions, by the Company and at least three of the Managing Members);  provided,  however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment to Section 3.01, Section 3.02 or Section 5.10 of this Agreement which will materially and adversely affect the rights of any third party beneficiary hereunder must receive the prior written consent of the Majority in Interest of the Purchasers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any provision of this Agreement may only be waived at any time by an instrument signed in writing by the party entitled to the benefit thereof. Except as specifically provided herein, the failure or delay of any party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of or non-compliance with this Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or non-compliance. Following the completion of the Dissolution Transactions, any action or consent otherwise required to be taken under this Agreement by any Holdings Party may be taken by action of any three of the Managing Members.

^Specific Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

SECTION 5.12.  Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction by a court of competent jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 5.13.  Further Assurances. The Company and the Holdings Parties will use all reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in connection with the Conversion and the Dissolution Transactions, and shall promptly take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the Conversion and the Dissolution Transactions. The Holdings Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to provide any information requested by the Company for any regulatory application or filing made or approval sought for the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement.

SECTION 5.14.  Successors and Assigns;.

Except as contemplated by Section 3.06, this Agreement may not be assigned by a party without the prior written consent of the other party (and any purported assignment without such consent shall be void and without effect). Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except that the provisions of Article IV are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each indemnified party described therein, the provisions of Section 4.05 are also intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, any other Person referenced therein from whom an indemnified party may have rights to indemnification, and the Purchasers are intended third party beneficiaries of Section 3.01 and Section 3.02 of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.07.
