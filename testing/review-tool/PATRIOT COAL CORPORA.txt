^Guaranties  

Each Guarantor by its execution of this Supplemental Indenture agrees to be a Guarantor under the Indenture and agrees as follows: 

Section 2.01. *The Guaranties*. Subject to the provisions of this Article, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, the full and punctual payment (whether at maturity, upon any redemption, by declaration or acceleration, or otherwise) of 

^^^^^ 
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable under, each Security, and the full and punctual payment of all other amounts payable by the Issuer under the Indenture or under any Paying Agency Agreement. Upon failure by the Issuer to pay punctually any such amount, each Guarantor shall forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the manner specified in the Indenture. 

Section 2.02 . *Guaranty Unconditional*. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, will not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by: 

^any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any obligation of the Issuer under the Indenture or any Security, by operation of law or otherwise; 

^subject to Section 2.09 hereof, any modification or amendment of or supplement to the Indenture or any Security; 

^any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Issuer, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Issuer or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of the Issuer contained in the Indenture or any Security; 

^the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the Guarantor may have at any time against the Issuer, the Trustee or any other Person, whether in connection with the Indenture or any unrelated transactions, *provided* that nothing herein prevents the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim; 

^any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the Issuer for any reason of the Indenture or any Security, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by the Issuer of the principal of or interest on any Security or any other amount payable by the Issuer under the Indenture; or 

^any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Issuer, the Trustee or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or defense to such Guarantor’s obligations hereunder. 

Section 2.03 . *Discharge; Reinstatement*. Each Guarantor’s obligations hereunder will remain in full force and effect until the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities and all other amounts payable by the Issuer under the Indenture have been paid in full. If at any time any payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security or any other amount payable by the Issuer under the Indenture is rescinded or must be otherwise 

^^^^^ 
restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Issuer or otherwise, each Guarantor’s obligations hereunder with respect to such payment will be reinstated as though such payment had been due but not made at such time. 

Section 2.04. *Waiver by the Guarantors.* Each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the Issuer or any other Person. 

Section 2.05. *Subrogation and Contribution.* Upon making any payment with respect to any obligation of the Issuer under this Article, the Guarantor making such payment will be subrogated to the rights of the payee against the Issuer with respect to such obligation, provided that the Guarantor may not enforce either any right of subrogation, or any right to receive payment in the nature of contribution, or otherwise, from any other Guarantor, with respect to such payment so long as any amount payable by the Issuer hereunder or under the Securities remains unpaid. 

Section 2.06. *Stay of Acceleration.* If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Issuer under the Indenture or the Securities is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Issuer, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Indenture are nonetheless payable by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Trustee or the Holders. 

Section 2.07. *Limitation on Amount of Guaranty.* Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Securities, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Security Guaranty of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law. To effectuate that intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of each Guarantor under its Security Guaranty are limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law. 

Section 2.08. *Execution and Delivery of Guaranty.* The execution by each Guarantor of this Supplemental Indenture evidences the Security Guaranty of such Guarantor, whether or not the person signing as an officer of the Guarantor still holds that office at the time of authentication of any Security. The delivery of any Security by the Trustee after authentication constitutes due delivery of the Security Guaranty set forth in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf of each Guarantor. 

^^^^^ 
^*Release of Guaranty.* The Security Guaranty of a Guarantor will terminate upon: 

^the conditions set forth in the Officers’ Certificate or the supplemental indenture invoking this Supplemental Indenture with respect to one or more series of Securities, or 

^defeasance or discharge of the Securities, as provided in Section 9.01 or Article 12 of the Indenture. 

Upon delivery by the Issuer to the Trustee of an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the foregoing effect, the Trustee will execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of the Guarantor from its obligations under its Security Guaranty. 

^Miscellaneous  

Section 3.01. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein are used as defined in the Indenture. 

Section 3.02. This Supplemental Indenture shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 

Section 3.03. This Supplemental Indenture may be signed in various counterparts which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 

Section 3.04. This Supplemental Indenture is an amendment supplemental to the Indenture and the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture will henceforth be read together with respect to one or more series of Securities, if and only if, the Officers’ Certificate or supplemental indenture establishing such series specifically invokes this Supplemental Indenture.
