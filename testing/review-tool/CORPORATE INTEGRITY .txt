^**Breach and Default Provisions**  

Wright is expected to fully and timely comply with all of its CIA obligations. 

^Stipulated Penalties for Failure to Comply with Certain Obligations. As a contractual remedy, Wright and OIG hereby agree that failure to comply with certain obligations as set forth in this CIA may lead to the imposition of the following monetary penalties (hereinafter referred to as “Stipulated Penalties”) in accordance with the following provisions. 

^A Stipulated Penalty of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] (which shall begin to accrue on the day after the date the obligation became due) for each calendar day Wright fails to establish and implement any of the following obligations as described in Section III: 

^^a Compliance Officer;  
^^a Compliance Committee; 

^^a written Code of Conduct; 
^^written Policies and Procedures; 
^^the training of Covered Persons and Arrangements Covered Persons; 

^^the Focus Arrangements Procedures and/or Focus Arrangements Requirements described in Sections III.D.1 and III.D.2; 

^^a Disclosure Program;

Wright Medical Technology, Inc.  Corporate Integrity Agreement 

^^^^^ 
^^reporting of Reportable Events.  

^A Stipulated Penalty of $[[USD Value 1]] (which shall begin to accrue on the day after the date the obligation became due) for each day Wright fails to engage an IRO, as required in Section III.E and Appendix A. 

^A Stipulated Penalty of $[[USD Value 1]] (which shall begin to accrue on the day after the date the obligation became due) for each day Wright fails to submit the Implementation Report, documentation required under Section V.B., or any Annual Reports to OIG in accordance with the requirements of Section V by the deadlines for submission. 

^A Stipulated Penalty of $[[USD Value 1]] (which shall begin to accrue on the day after the date the obligation became due) for each day Wright fails to submit the annual Arrangements Review Report in accordance with the requirements of Section III.E and Appendix B. 

^A Stipulated Penalty of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] for each day Wright fails to grant access as required in Section VII. (This Stipulated Penalty shall begin to accrue on the date Wright fails to grant access.) 

^A Stipulated Penalty of $[[USD Value 3: Number]] for each false certification submitted by or on behalf of Wright as part of its Implementation Report, Annual Report, additional documentation to a report (as requested by the OIG), or otherwise required by this CIA. 

^A Stipulated Penalty of $[[USD Value 4: Number]] (which shall begin to accrue on the day after the date the obligation became due) for each day Wright fails to cooperate and otherwise satisfy any of the obligations and requirements as described in Section III.J. 

^A Stipulated Penalty of $[[USD Value 5: Number]] for each day Wright fails to comply fully and adequately with any obligation of this CIA.

(This Stipulated Penalty shall begin to accrue 10 days after Wright receives this notice from OIG of the failure to comply.) A Stipulated Penalty as described in this Subsection shall not be demanded for any violation for which OIG has sought a Stipulated Penalty under Subsections 1-7 of this Section. 

Wright Medical Technology, Inc.  Corporate Integrity Agreement 

^^^^^ 
^Timely Written Requests for Extensions. 

Wright may, in advance of the due date, submit a timely written request for an extension of time to perform any act or file any notification or report required by this CIA. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section, if OIG grants the timely written request with respect to an act, notification, or report, Stipulated Penalties for failure to perform the act or file the notification or report shall not begin to accrue until one day after Wright fails to meet the revised deadline set by OIG. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section, if OIG denies such a timely written request, Stipulated Penalties for failure to perform the act or file the notification or report shall not begin to accrue until three business days after Wright receives OIG’s written denial of such request or the original due date, whichever is later. A “timely written request” is defined as a request in writing received by OIG at least five business days prior to the date by which any act is due to be performed or any notification or report is due to be filed. 

^Payment of Stipulated Penalties.  

^*Demand Letter*. Upon a finding that Wright has failed to comply with any of the obligations described in Section X.A and after determining that Stipulated Penalties are appropriate, OIG shall notify Wright of: (a) Wright’s failure to comply; and (b) OIG’s exercise of its contractual right to demand payment of the Stipulated Penalties (this notification is referred to as the “Demand Letter”). Such Demand Letter shall specifically state the conduct that the OIG contends constitutes the basis for imposing the Stipulated Penalty. 

^*Response to Demand Letter.* Within 10 days after the receipt of the Demand Letter, Wright shall either: (a) cure the breach to OIG’s satisfaction and pay the applicable Stipulated Penalties or (b) request a hearing before an HHS administrative law judge (ALJ) to dispute OIG’s determination of noncompliance, pursuant to the agreed upon provisions set forth below in Section X.E. In the event Wright elects to request an ALJ hearing, the Stipulated Penalties shall continue to accrue until Wright cures, to OIG’s satisfaction, the alleged breach in dispute. Failure to respond to the Demand Letter in one of these two manners within the allowed time period shall be considered a material breach of this CIA and shall be grounds for exclusion under Section X.D. 

Wright Medical Technology, Inc.  Corporate Integrity Agreement 

^^^^^ 
^*Form of Payment*. Payment of the Stipulated Penalties shall be made by electronic funds transfer to an account specified by OIG in the Demand Letter. 

^*Independence from Material Breach Determination*. Except as set forth in Section X.D.1.d, these provisions for payment of Stipulated Penalties shall not affect or otherwise set a standard for OIG’s decision that Wright has materially breached this CIA, which decision shall be made at OIG’s discretion and shall be governed by the provisions in Section X.D, below. 

^Exclusion for Material Breach of this CIA. 

^*Definition of Material Breach*. A material breach of this CIA means: 

^^a failure by Wright to report a Reportable Event, take corrective action, and make the appropriate refunds, as required in Section III.I; 

^^a repeated or flagrant violation of the obligations under this CIA, including, but not limited to, the obligations addressed in Section X.A; 

^^a failure to respond to a Demand Letter concerning the payment of Stipulated Penalties in accordance with Section X.C; or 

^^a failure to engage and use an IRO in accordance with Section III.E. and Appendix A. 

^^a repeated or flagrant failure by Wright to cooperate in accordance with Section III.J. 

^*Notice of Material Breach and Intent to Exclude*. The parties agree that a material breach of this CIA by Wright constitutes an independent basis for Wright’s exclusion from participation in the Federal health care programs. Upon a determination by OIG that Wright has materially breached this CIA and that exclusion is the appropriate remedy, OIG shall notify Wright of: (a) Wright’s material breach; and (b) OIG’s intent to exercise its contractual right to impose exclusion (this notification is hereinafter referred 

Wright Medical Technology, Inc.  Corporate Integrity Agreement 

^^^^^ 
to as the “Notice of Material Breach and Intent to Exclude”). 

^*Opportunity to Cure*. Wright shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of the Notice of Material Breach and Intent to Exclude to demonstrate to OIG’s satisfaction that: 

^^Wright is in compliance with the obligations of the CIA cited by OIG as being the basis for the material breach; 

^^the alleged material breach has been cured; or 

^^the alleged material breach cannot be cured within the 30-day period, but that: (i) Wright has begun to take action to cure the material breach; (ii) Wright is pursuing such action with due diligence; and (iii) Wright has provided to OIG a reasonable timetable for curing the material breach. 

^*Exclusion Letter*. If, at the conclusion of the 30-day period, Wright fails to satisfy the requirements of Section X.D.3, OIG may exclude Wright from participation in the Federal health care programs. OIG shall notify Wright in writing of its determination to exclude Wright (this letter shall be referred to hereinafter as the “Exclusion Letter”). Subject to the Dispute Resolution provisions in Section X.E, below, the exclusion shall go into effect 30 days after the date of Wright’s receipt of the Exclusion Letter. The exclusion shall have national effect and shall also apply to all other Federal procurement and nonprocurement programs. Reinstatement to program participation is not automatic. After the end of the period of exclusion, Wright may apply for reinstatement by submitting a written request for reinstatement in accordance with the provisions at 42 C.F.R. §§ 1001.3001-.3004. 

^Dispute Resolution  

^*Review Rights*. Upon OIG’s delivery to Wright of its Demand Letter or of its Exclusion Letter, and as an agreed-upon contractual remedy for the resolution of disputes arising under this CIA, Wright shall be afforded certain review rights comparable to the ones that are provided in 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(f) and 42 C.F.R. Part 1005 as if they applied to the Stipulated Penalties or exclusion sought pursuant to this CIA. Specifically, OIG’s determination to demand payment of Stipulated Penalties or to 

Wright Medical Technology, Inc.  Corporate Integrity Agreement 

^^^^^ 
seek exclusion shall be subject to review by an HHS ALJ and, in the event of an appeal, the HHS Departmental Appeals Board (DAB), in a manner consistent with the provisions in 42 C.F.R. § 1005.2-1005.21. Notwithstanding the language in 42 C.F.R. § 1005.2(c), the request for a hearing involving Stipulated Penalties shall be made within 10 days after receipt of the Demand Letter and the request for a hearing involving exclusion shall be made within 25 days after receipt of the Exclusion Letter. 

^*Stipulated Penalties Review*. Notwithstanding any provision of Title 42 of the United States Code or Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the only issues in a proceeding for Stipulated Penalties under this CIA shall be: (a) whether Wright was in full and timely compliance with the obligations of this CIA for which OIG demands payment; and (b) the period of noncompliance. Wright shall have the burden of proving its full and timely compliance and the steps taken to cure the noncompliance, if any. OIG shall not have the right to appeal to the DAB an adverse ALJ decision related to Stipulated Penalties. If the ALJ agrees with OIG with regard to a finding of a breach of this CIA and orders Wright to pay Stipulated Penalties, such Stipulated Penalties shall become due and payable 20 days after the ALJ issues such a decision unless Wright requests review of the ALJ decision by the DAB. If the ALJ decision is properly appealed to the DAB and the DAB upholds the determination of OIG, the Stipulated Penalties shall become due and payable 20 days after the DAB issues its decision. 

^*Exclusion Review*. Notwithstanding any provision of Title 42 of the United States Code or Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the only issues in a proceeding for exclusion based on a material breach of this CIA shall be: 

^^whether Wright was in material breach of this CIA; 

^^whether such breach was continuing on the date of the Exclusion Letter; and 

^^whether the alleged material breach could not have been cured within the 30-day period, but that: (i) Wright had begun to take action to cure the material breach within that period; (ii) Wright has pursued and is pursuing such action with due diligence; and (iii) Wright provided to OIG within that period a reasonable timetable for curing the material breach and Wright has followed the timetable. 

Wright Medical Technology, Inc.  Corporate Integrity Agreement 

^^^^^ 
For purposes of the exclusion herein, exclusion shall take effect only after an ALJ decision favorable to OIG, or, if the ALJ rules for Wright, only after a DAB decision in favor of OIG. Wright’s election of its contractual right to appeal to the DAB shall not abrogate OIG’s authority to exclude Wright upon the issuance of an ALJ’s decision in favor of OIG. If the ALJ sustains the determination of OIG and determines that exclusion is authorized, such exclusion shall take effect 20 days after the ALJ issues such a decision, notwithstanding that Wright may request review of the ALJ decision by the DAB. If the DAB finds in favor of OIG after an ALJ decision adverse to OIG, the exclusion shall take effect 20 days after the DAB decision. Wright shall waive its right to any notice of such an exclusion if a decision upholding the exclusion is rendered by the ALJ or DAB. If the DAB finds in favor of Wright, Wright shall be reinstated effective on the date of the original exclusion. 

^*Finality of Decision.* The review by an ALJ or DAB provided for above shall not be considered to be an appeal right arising under any statutes or regulations. Consequently, the parties to this CIA agree that the DAB’s decision (or the ALJ’s decision if not appealed) shall be considered final for all purposes under this CIA. 

^^^**Effective and Binding Agreement**  

Wright and OIG agree as follows:  

^This CIA shall be binding on the successors, assigns, and transferees of Wright; 

^This CIA shall become final and binding on the later of (1) the date the final signature is obtained on the CIA; or (2) the date the Civil Settlement Agreement becomes effective. 

^This CIA constitutes the complete agreement between the parties and may not be amended except by written consent of the parties to this CIA; 

^OIG may agree to a suspension of Wright’s obligations under this CIA based on a certification by Wright that it is no longer providing health care items or services that will be billed to any Federal health care program and that it does not have any ownership 

Wright Medical Technology, Inc.  Corporate Integrity Agreement 

^^^^^ 
or control interest, as defined in 42 U.S.C. §1320a-3, in any entity that bills any Federal health care program. If Wright is relieved of its CIA obligations, Wright will be required to notify OIG in writing at least 30 days in advance if Wright plans to resume providing health care items or services that are billed to any Federal health care program or to obtain an ownership or control interest in any entity that bills any Federal health care program. At such time, OIG shall evaluate whether the CIA will be reactivated or modified. 

^The undersigned Wright signatories represent and warrant that they are authorized to execute this CIA. The undersigned OIG signatory represents that he is signing this CIA in his official capacity and that he is authorized to execute this CIA. 

^This CIA may be executed in counterparts, each of which constitutes an original and all of which constitute one and the same CIA. Facsimiles of signatures shall constitute acceptable, binding signatures for purposes of this CIA.

\centered **APPENDIX A** 

\centered **INDEPENDENT REVIEW ORGANIZATION** 

This Appendix contains the requirements relating to the Independent Review Organization (IRO) required by Section III.E of the CIA. 

^IRO Engagement.  

Wright shall engage an IRO that possesses the qualifications set forth in Paragraph C, of this Appendix, to perform the responsibilities in Paragraph D, of this Appendix. The IRO shall conduct the review in a professionally independent and objective fashion, as set forth in Paragraph E, of this Appendix. Within 30 days after OIG receives the information identified in Paragraph B, of this Appendix, OIG will notify Wright if the IRO is unacceptable. Absent notification from OIG that the IRO is unacceptable, Wright may continue to engage the IRO. 

If Wright engages a new IRO during the term of the CIA, this IRO shall also meet the requirements of this Appendix. If a new IRO is engaged, Wright shall submit the information identified in Paragraph B, of this Appendix, to OIG within 30 days of engagement of the IRO. Within 30 days after OIG receives this information, OIG will notify Wright if the IRO is unacceptable. Absent notification from OIG that the IRO is unacceptable, Wright may continue to engage the IRO. 

^Information Regarding the IRO.  
^identity, address, and phone number;

^a copy of the engagement letter;

^a summary and description of any and all current and prior engagements and agreements between Wright and the IRO;

^the proposed start and completion dates of the Arrangements Review;

^a certification from the IRO regarding its professional independence and objectivity with respect to Wright; and

^the professional qualifications of individuals assigned by the IRO to the engagement.

Wright Medical Technology, Inc.  Appendix A 

^^^^^ 
^IRO Qualifications.  
The IRO shall:  

^assign individuals to conduct the Arrangements Review engagement who are knowledgeable in the requirements of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the regulations and other guidance documents related to this statute; and 

^have sufficient staff and resources to conduct the reviews required by the CIA on a timely basis. 

^IRO Responsibilities.  
The IRO shall:  

^perform each Arrangements Review in accordance with the specific requirements of the CIA; 

^respond to all OIG inquiries in a prompt, objective, and factual manner; and 

^prepare timely, clear, well-written reports that include all the information required by Appendix B to the CIA. 

^IRO Independence and Objectivity.  

The IRO must perform the Arrangements Review in a professionally independent and objective fashion, as appropriate to the nature of the engagement, taking into account any other business relationships or engagements that may exist between the IRO and Wright. 

^IRO Removal/Termination.  

^*Provider*. If Wright terminates its IRO during the course of the engagement, Wright must submit a notice explaining its reasons to OIG no later than 30 days after termination. Wright must engage a new IRO in accordance with Paragraph A, of this Appendix. 

^*OIG Removal of IRO*. In the event OIG has reason to believe that the IRO does not possess the qualifications described in Paragraph B, of this Appendix, is not independent and objective as set forth in Paragraph E, of this Appendix, or has failed to carry out its responsibilities as described in Paragraph D, of this Appendix, OIG may, at its sole discretion, require Wright to engage a new IRO in accordance with Paragraph A of this Appendix. 

Wright Medical Technology, Inc.  Appendix A 

^^^^^ 
Prior to requiring Wright to engage a new IRO, OIG shall notify Wright of its intent to do so and provide a written explanation of why OIG believes such a step is necessary. To resolve any concerns raised by OIG, Wright may request a meeting with OIG to discuss any aspect of the IRO’s qualifications, independence or performance of its responsibilities and to present additional information regarding these matters. Wright shall provide any additional information as may be requested by OIG under this Paragraph in an expedited manner. OIG will attempt in good faith to resolve any differences regarding the IRO with Wright prior to requiring Wright to terminate the IRO. However, the final determination as to whether or not to require Wright to engage a new IRO shall be made at the sole discretion of OIG.

\centered **Appendix B** 

\centered **Arrangements Review** 

The Arrangements Review shall consist of two components: a systems review and a transactions review. The IRO shall perform all components of each Arrangements Review. If there are no material changes to Wright’s systems, processes, policies, and procedures relating to Arrangements, the Arrangements Systems Review shall be performed for the second and fourth Reporting Periods. If Wright materially changes the Arrangements systems, processes, policies and procedures, the IRO shall perform an Arrangements Systems Review for the Reporting Period in which such changes were made in addition to conducting the systems review for the second and fourth Reporting Periods. The Arrangements Transactions Review shall be performed annually and shall cover each of the five Reporting Periods. 

^Arrangements Systems Review. The Arrangements Systems Review shall be a review of Wright’s systems, processes, policies, and procedures relating to the initiation, review, approval, and tracking of Arrangements. Specifically, the IRO shall review the following:
