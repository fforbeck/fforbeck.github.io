Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, be made under the Plan in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines. The Committee shall have full and exclusive discretionary power to adopt rules, forms, instruments, and guidelines for administering the Plan as the Committee deems necessary or proper. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.1 to the contrary, the Board, or any other committee or sub-committee established by the Board, is hereby authorized (in addition to any necessary action by the Committee) to grant or approve Awards as necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and to act in lieu of the Committee with respect to Awards made to Non-Employee Directors under the Plan.

^^**Delegation.** The Committee may delegate to one or more of its members, one or more officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and one or more agents or advisors such administrative duties or powers as it may deem advisable; *provided* that the Committee shall not delegate to officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates the power to make grants of Awards to officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; *provided*, *further*, that no delegation shall be permitted under the Plan that is prohibited by applicable law. 

^^**Eligibility.** Participants will consist of such Employees and Directors as the Committee in its sole discretion determines and whom the Committee may designate from time to time to receive Awards. Designation of a Participant in any year shall not require the Committee to designate such person to receive an Award in any other year or, once designated, to receive the same type or amount of Award as granted to the Participant in any other year. 

^^**Type of Awards.** Awards under the Plan may be granted in any one or a combination of: (a) Options, (b) Stock Appreciation Rights, (c) Restricted Stock, (d) Other Stock-Based Awards, and (e) Performance-Based Compensation Awards. The Plan sets forth the types of performance goals and sets forth procedural requirements to permit the Company to design Awards that qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, as described in Article 10 hereof.

^^Number of Shares Available for Awards. 

^^(i) **General.** Subject to adjustment as provided in Article 12 hereof, the maximum number of Shares available for issuance to Participants pursuant to Awards under the Plan shall be [[Shares 1: Number]] Shares. The number of Shares available for granting Incentive Stock Options under the Plan shall not exceed [[Shares 2: Number]] Shares, subject to Article 12 hereof and the provisions of Sections 422 or 424 of the Code and any successor provisions. The Shares available for issuance under the Plan may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued Shares or treasury Shares.

^^**Annual Award Limits.** The maximum number of Shares with respect to Awards denominated in Shares that may be granted to any Participant in any Plan Year shall be [[Shares 3: Number]] Shares, subject to adjustments made in accordance with Article 12 hereof (the “Annual Award Limit”).

^^**Additional Shares.** In the event that any outstanding Award expires, is forfeited, cancelled or otherwise terminated without the issuance of Shares or is otherwise settled for cash, the Shares subject to such Award, to the extent of any such forfeiture, cancellation, expiration, termination or settlement for cash, shall again be available for Awards. If the Committee authorizes the assumption under this Plan, in connection with any merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, or reorganization, of awards granted under another plan, such assumption shall not (i) reduce the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under this Plan or (ii) be subject to or counted against a Participant’s Annual Award Limit.

^^**Grant of Options.** The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Options to Participants. Each Option shall permit a Participant to purchase from the Company a stated number of Shares at an Option Price established by the Committee, subject to the terms and conditions described in this Article 6 and to such additional terms and conditions, as established by the Committee, in its sole discretion, that are consistent with the provisions of the Plan. Options shall be designated as either Incentive Stock Options or 

Represents [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the total outstanding shares after the full issuance of warrants.

Nonqualified Stock Options, provided that Options granted to Directors shall be Nonqualified Stock Options. An Option granted as an Incentive Stock Option shall, to the extent it fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option. Neither the Committee nor the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be liable to any Participant or to any other Person if it is determined that an Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option. Each option shall be evidenced by Award Agreements which shall state the number of Shares covered by such Option. Such agreements shall conform to the requirements of the Plan, and may contain such other provisions, as the Committee shall deem advisable. 

^^**Terms of Option Grant.** The Option Price shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant, but shall not be less than one-hundred percent ([[Percentage 4: Number]]%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. In the case of any Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Shareholder, the Option Price shall not be less than one-hundred-ten percent ([[Percentage 5: Number]]%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. 

^^**Option Term.** The term of each Option shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant and shall be stated in the Award Agreement, but in no event shall such term be greater than ten (10) years (or, in the case on an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Shareholder, five (5) years). 

^^**Method of Exercise.** Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in an Award Agreement, an Option may be exercised for all, or from time to time any part, of the Shares for which it is then exercisable. For purposes of this Article 6, the exercise date of an Option shall be the later of the date a notice of exercise is received by the Company and, if applicable, the date payment is received by the Company pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the following sentence (including the applicable tax withholding pursuant to Section 14.3 of the Plan). The aggregate Option Price for the Shares as to which an Option is exercised shall be paid to the Company in full at the time of exercise at the election of the Participant (i) in cash or its equivalent (e.g., by cashier’s check), (ii) to the extent permitted by the Committee, in Shares (whether or not previously owned by the Participant) having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Committee, (iii) partly in cash and, to the extent permitted by the Committee, partly in such Shares (as described in (ii) above) or (iv) if there is a public market for the Shares at such time, subject to such requirements as may be imposed by the Committee, through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares obtained upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the Company an amount out of the proceeds of such sale equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased. The Committee may prescribe any other method of payment that it determines to be consistent with applicable law and the purpose of the Plan. 

^^**Limitations on Incentive Stock Options.** Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or of a “parent corporation” or “subsidiary corporation” (as such terms are defined in Section 424 of the Code) at the date of grant. The aggregate Fair Market Value (generally determined as of the time the Option is granted) of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year under all plans of the Company and of any “parent corporation” or “subsidiary corporation” shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]), or the Option shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option. For purposes of the preceding sentence, Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account generally in the order in which they are granted. Each provision of the Plan and each Award Agreement relating to an Incentive Stock Option shall be construed so that each Incentive Stock Option shall be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code, and any provisions of the Award Agreement thereof that cannot be so construed shall be disregarded. 

^^**Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights.** The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Participants, including a grant of Stock Appreciation Rights in tandem with any Option at the same time such Option is granted (a “Tandem SAR”). Stock Appreciation Rights shall be evidenced by Award Agreements that shall conform to the requirements of the Plan and may contain such other provisions, as the Committee shall deem advisable. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, a Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall confer on the holder thereof a right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (a) the Fair Market Value of a specified number of Shares on the date of exercise over (b) the grant price of the right as specified by the Committee on the date of the grant. Such payment may be in the form of cash, Shares, other property or any combination thereof, as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. 

^^**Terms of Stock Appreciation Right.** Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the grant price (which shall not be less than one hundred percent ([[Percentage 4]]%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant), term, methods of exercise, methods of settlement, and any other terms and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right shall be as determined by the Committee. The Committee may impose such other conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it may deem appropriate. No Stock Appreciation Right shall have a term of more than ten (10) years from the date of grant. 

^^**Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights and Options.** A Tandem SAR shall be exercisable only to the extent that the related Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the expiration of the related Option. Upon the exercise of all or a portion of a Tandem SAR, a Participant shall be required to forfeit the right to purchase an equivalent portion of the related Option (and, when a Share is purchased under the related Option, the Participant shall be required to forfeit an equivalent portion of the Stock Appreciation Right). 

^^**Grant of Restricted Stock.** An Award of Restricted Stock is a grant by the Committee of a specified number of Shares to the Participant, which Shares are subject to forfeiture upon the occurrence of specified events. Participants shall be awarded Restricted Stock in exchange for consideration not less than the minimum consideration required by applicable law. Restricted Stock shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement, which shall conform to the requirements of the Plan and may contain such other provisions, as the Committee shall deem advisable. 

^^**Terms of Restricted Stock Awards.** Each Award Agreement evidencing a Restricted Stock grant shall specify the period(s) of restriction, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock subject to the Award, the performance, employment or other conditions (including the termination of a Participant’s Service whether due to death, disability or other reason) under which the Restricted Stock may be forfeited to the Company and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine. Any Restricted Stock granted under the Plan shall be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate, including book-entry registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates (in which case, the certificate(s) representing such Shares shall be legended as to sale, transfer, assignment, pledge or other encumbrances during the Restriction Period and deposited by the Participant, together with a stock power endorsed in blank, with the Company, to be held in escrow during the Restriction Period). At the end of the Restriction Period, the restrictions imposed hereunder and under the Award Agreement shall lapse with respect to the number of Shares of Restricted Stock as determined by the Committee, and the legend shall be removed and such number of Shares delivered to the Participant (or, where appropriate, the Participant’s legal representative). 

^^**Voting and Dividend Rights.** The Committee shall determine and set forth in a Participant’s Award Agreement whether or not a Participant holding Restricted Stock granted hereunder shall have the right to exercise voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock during the Restriction Period (the Committee may require a Participant to grant an irrevocable proxy and power of substitution) and/or have the right to receive dividends on the Restricted Stock during the Restriction Period (and, if so, on what terms). 

^^**Performance Goals.** The Committee may condition the grant of Restricted Stock or the expiration of the Restriction Period upon the Participant’s achievement of one or more performance goal(s) specified in the Award Agreement. If the Participant fails to achieve the specified performance goal(s), the Committee shall not grant the Restricted Stock to such Participant or the Participant shall forfeit the Award of Restricted Stock to the Company, as applicable. 

^^**Section 83(b) Election.** If a Participant makes an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code concerning Restricted Stock, the Participant shall be required to file promptly a copy of such election with the Company. 

The Committee, in its sole discretion, may grant Awards of Shares and Awards that are valued, in whole or in part, by reference to, or are otherwise based on the Fair Market Value of, Shares (the “Other Stock-Based Awards”), including without limitation, restricted stock units and other phantom awards. Such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be in such form, and dependent on such conditions, as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, the right to receive one or more Shares (or the equivalent cash value of such Shares) upon the completion of a specified period of Service, the occurrence of an event and/or the attainment of performance objectives. Other Stock-Based Awards may be granted alone or in addition to any other Awards granted under the Plan. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine to whom and when Other Stock-Based Awards will be made, the number of Shares to be awarded under (or otherwise related to) such Other Stock-Based Awards, whether such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares, and all other terms and conditions of such Awards (including, without limitation, the vesting provisions thereof and provisions ensuring that all Shares so awarded and issued shall be fully paid and non-assessable). 

^^**Grant of Performance-Based Compensation.** To the extent permitted by Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee is authorized to design any Award so that the amounts or Shares payable or distributed pursuant to such Award are treated as “qualified performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and related regulations. 

^^**Performance Measures.** The vesting, crediting and/or payment of Performance-Based Compensation shall be based on the achievement of objective performance goals based on one or more of the following Performance Measures: (i) consolidated earnings before or after taxes (including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization); (ii) net income; (iii) operating income; (iv) earnings per Share; (v) book value per Share; (vi) return on shareholders’ equity; (vii) expense management; (viii) return on investment; (ix) improvements in capital structure; (x) profitability of an identifiable business unit or product; (xi) maintenance or improvement of profit margins; (xii) stock price; (xiii) market share; (xiv) revenues or sales; (xv) costs; (xvi) cash flow; (xvii) working capital; (xviii) return on assets; (xix) store openings or refurbishment plans; (xx) staff training; and (xxi) corporate social responsibility policy implementation. 

Any Performance Measure may be (i) used to measure the performance of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as a whole, any business unit thereof or any combination thereof against any goal including past performance or (ii) compared to the performance of a group of comparable companies, or a published or special index, in each case that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. Subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may adjust the performance goals (including to prorate goals and payments for a partial Plan Year) in the event of the following occurrences: (a) non-recurring events, including divestitures, spin-offs, or changes in accounting standards or policies; (b) mergers and acquisitions; and (c) financing transactions, including selling accounts receivable. 

^^**Establishment of Performance Goals for Covered Employees.** No later than ninety (90) days after the commencement of a Performance Period (but in no event after twenty-five percent ([[Percentage 6: Number]]%) of such Performance Period has elapsed), the Committee shall establish in writing: (i) the performance goals applicable to the Performance Period; (ii) the Performance Measures to be used to measure the performance goals in terms of an objective formula or standard; (iii) the formula for computing the amount of compensation payable to the Participant if such performance goals are obtained; and (iv) the Participants or class of Participants to which such performance goals apply. The outcome of such performance goals must be substantially uncertain when the Committee establishes the goals. 

^^**Adjustment of Performance-Based Compensation.** Awards that are designed to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation may not be adjusted upward. The Committee shall retain the discretion to adjust such Awards downward, either on a formula or discretionary basis or any combination, as the Committee determines. 

^^**Certification of Performance.** Except for Awards that pay compensation attributable solely to an increase in the value of Shares, no Award designed to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation shall be vested, credited or paid, as applicable, with respect to any Participant until the Committee certifies in writing that the performance goals and any other material terms applicable to such Performance Period have been satisfied. 

^^**Interpretation****.** Each provision of the Plan and each Award Agreement relating to Performance-Based Compensation shall be construed so that each such Award shall be “qualified performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and related regulations, and any provisions of the Award Agreement thereof that cannot be so construed shall be disregarded. 

^^**General.** The Company intends that any Awards be structured in compliance with, or to satisfy an exemption from, Section 409A of the Code and all regulations, guidance, compliance programs and other interpretative authority thereunder (“Section 409A”), such that there are no adverse tax consequences, interest, or penalties as a result of the Awards. Notwithstanding the Company’s intention, in the event any Award is subject to Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion and without a Participant’s prior consent, amend the Plan and/or Awards, adopt policies and procedures, or take any other actions (including amendments, policies, procedures and actions with retroactive effect) as are necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the Plan and/or any Award from the application of Section 409A, (ii) preserve the intended tax treatment of any such Award, or (iii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A, including without limitation any such regulations guidance, compliance programs and other interpretative authority that may be issued after the date of grant of an Award. 

^^**Payments to Specified Employees.** Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Plan or Award Agreement, any payment(s) of nonqualified deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) that are otherwise required to be made under the Plan to a “specified employee” (as defined under Section 409A) as a result of his or her separation from service (other than a payment that is not subject to Section 409A) shall be delayed for the first six (6) months following such separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the specified employee) and shall instead be paid (in a manner set forth in the Award Agreement) on the payment date that immediately follows the end of such six-month period or as soon as administratively practicable within 90 days thereafter, but in no event later than the end of the applicable taxable year. 

^^**Separation from Service.** A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits that are considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment, unless such termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A and the payment thereof prior to a “separation from service” would violate Section 409A. For purposes of any such provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement relating to any such payments or benefits, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall mean “separation from service.” 

^^Section 457A. The Company intends that any Awards be structured in compliance with, or to satisfy an exemption from, Section 457A of the Code (“Section 457A”) and all regulations, guidance, compliance programs and other interpretative authority thereunder, such that there are no adverse tax consequences, interest, or penalties as a result of the Awards. Notwithstanding the Company’s intention, in the event any Award is subject to Section 457A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion and without a Participant’s prior consent, amend the Plan and/or Awards, adopt policies and procedures, or take any other actions (including amendments, policies, procedures and actions with retroactive effect) as are necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the Plan and/or any Award from the application of Section 457A, (ii) preserve the intended tax treatment of any such Award, or (iii) comply with the requirements of Section 457A, including without limitation any such regulations, guidance, compliance programs and other interpretative authority that may be issued after the date of the grant. 

^^**Adjustments in Authorized Shares****.** In the event of any corporate event or transaction involving the Company, a Subsidiary and/or an Affiliate (including, but not limited to, a change in the Shares of the Company or the capitalization of the Company) such as a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, separation, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split up, spin-off, combination of Shares, exchange of Shares, dividend in kind, amalgamation, or other like change in capital structure (other than regular cash dividends to shareholders of the Company), or any similar corporate event or transaction, the Committee, to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants’ rights under the Plan, shall substitute or adjust, in its sole discretion, the number and kind of Shares or other property that may be issued under the Plan or under particular forms of Awards, the number and kind of Shares or other property subject to outstanding Awards, the Option Price, grant price or purchase price applicable to outstanding Awards, the Annual Award Limits, and/or other value determinations applicable to the Plan or outstanding Awards. 

^^**Change of Control.** Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control after the Effective Date, unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable laws or by the rules and regulations of any governing governmental agencies or national securities exchanges, or unless the Committee shall determine otherwise in the Award Agreement, the Committee is authorized (but not obligated) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of outstanding Awards, including without limitation the following 

(or any combination thereof): (i) continuation or assumption of such outstanding Awards under the Plan by the Company (if it is the surviving company or corporation) or by the surviving company or corporation or its parent; (ii) substitution by the surviving company or corporation or its parent of awards with substantially the same terms for such outstanding Awards; (iii) accelerated exercisability, vesting and/or lapse of restrictions under outstanding Awards immediately prior to the occurrence of such event; (iv) upon written notice, provide that any outstanding Awards must be exercised, to the extent then exercisable, during a reasonable period of time immediately prior to the scheduled consummation of the event, or such other period as determined by the Committee (contingent upon the consummation of the event), and at the end of such period, such Awards shall terminate to the extent not so exercised within the relevant period; and (v) cancellation of all or any portion of outstanding Awards for fair value (as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee and which may be zero) which, in the case of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights or similar Awards, if the Committee so determines, may equal the excess, if any, of the value of the consideration to be paid in the Change of Control transaction to holders of the same number of Shares subject to such Awards (or, if no such consideration is paid, Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to such outstanding Awards or portion thereof being canceled) over the aggregate Option Price or grant price, as applicable, with respect to such Awards or portion thereof being canceled (which may be zero). 

^^**Duration of the Plan.** Unless sooner terminated as provided in Section 13.2, the Plan shall terminate on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date. 

^^**Amendment, Modification, Suspension and Termination of Plan**. The Committee may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate (for purposes of this Section 13.2, an “Action”) the Plan or any portion thereof or any Award (or Award Agreement) thereunder at any time; *provided* that no such Action shall be made, other than as permitted under Article 11 or 12, (i) without shareholder approval (A) if such approval is necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory requirement applicable to the Plan, (B) if such Action increases the number of Shares available under the Plan (other than an increase permitted under Article 5 absent shareholder approval), (C) if such Action results in a material increase in benefits permitted under the Plan (but excluding increases that are immaterial or that are minor and to benefit the administration of the Plan, to take account of any changes in applicable law, or to obtain or maintain favorable tax, exchange, or regulatory treatment for the Company, a Subsidiary, and/or an Affiliate) or a change in eligibility requirements under the Plan, or (D) for any Action that results in a reduction of the Option Price or grant price per Share, as applicable, of any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or cancellation of any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for cash, or for other Awards, such as other Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, with an Option Price or grant price per Share, as applicable, that is less than such price of the original Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, and (ii) without the written consent of the affected Participant, if such Action would materially diminish the rights of any Participant under any Award theretofore granted to such Participant under the Plan; *provided*, *however,* that the Committee may amend the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement without such consent of the Participant in such manner as it deems necessary to comply with applicable laws. 

^^**No Right to Service.** The granting of an Award under the Plan shall impose no obligation on the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate to continue the Service of a Participant and shall not lessen or affect any right that the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate may have to terminate the Service of such Participant. No Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards. The terms and conditions of Awards and the Committee’s determinations and interpretations with respect thereto need not be the same with respect to each Participant (whether or not such Participants are similarly situated). 

^^**Settlement of Awards; Fractional Shares.** Each Award Agreement shall establish the form in which the Award shall be settled. The Committee shall determine whether cash, Awards, other securities or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be rounded, forfeited or otherwise eliminated. 

^^**Tax Withholding.** The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold automatically from any amount deliverable under the Award or otherwise, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, the minimum statutory amount to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of the Plan. With respect to required withholding, Participants may elect (subject to the Company’s automatic withholding right set out above), subject to the approval of the Committee, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the minimum statutory total tax that could be imposed on the transaction. 

^^**No Guarantees Regarding Tax Treatment.** Participants (or their beneficiaries) shall be responsible for all taxes with respect to any Awards under the Plan. The Committee and the Company make no guarantees to any Person regarding the tax treatment of Awards or payments made under the Plan. Neither the Committee nor the Company has any obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any tax on any Person with respect to any Award under Section 409A of the Code or Section 457A of the Code or otherwise and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any of their employees or representatives shall have any liability to a Participant with respect thereto. 

^^**Non-Transferability of Awards.** Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, an Award shall not be transferable or assignable by the Participant except in the event of his death (subject to the applicable laws of descent and distribution) and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate. No transfer shall be permitted for value or consideration. An award exercisable after the death of a Participant may be exercised by the legatees, personal representatives or distributees of the Participant. Any permitted transfer of the Awards to heirs or legatees of the Participant shall not be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with written notice thereof and a copy of such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and the acceptance by the transferee or transferees of the terms and conditions hereof. 

^^**Conditions and Restrictions on Shares.** The Committee may impose such other conditions or restrictions on any Shares received in connection with an Award as it may deem advisable or desirable. These restrictions may include, but shall not be limited to, a requirement that the Participant hold the Shares received for a specified period of time or a requirement that a Participant represent and warrant in writing that the Participant is acquiring the Shares for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares. The certificates for Shares may include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any conditions and restrictions applicable to such Shares. 

^^**Compliance with Law.** The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies, or any stock exchanges on which the Shares are admitted to trading or listed, as may be required. The Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver evidence of title for Shares issued under the Plan prior to: 

^^Obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable; and

^^Completion of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any applicable national, state or foreign law or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable.

The restrictions contained in this Section 14.7 shall be in addition to any conditions or restrictions that the Committee may impose pursuant to Section 14.6. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company’s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. 

^^**Awards to Non-U.S. Employees or Directors.** To comply with the laws in countries other than the United States in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates operates or has Employees or Directors, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to: 

^^Determine which Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be covered by the Plan;

^^Determine which Employees or Directors outside the United States are eligible to participate in the Plan;

^^Modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to Employees or Directors outside the United States to comply with applicable foreign laws;

^^Take any action, before or after an Award is made, that it deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with any necessary local government regulatory exemptions or approvals; and

^^Establish subplans and modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable. Any subplans and modifications to Plan terms and procedures established under this Section 14.8 by the Committee shall be attached to this Plan document as appendices.

^^**Rights as a Shareholder.** Except as otherwise provided herein or in the applicable Award Agreement, a Participant shall have none of the rights of a shareholder with respect to Shares covered by any Award until the Participant becomes the record holder of such Shares. 

^^**Severability.** If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person, or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect. 

^^**Unfunded Plan.** Participants shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any investments that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the 

Company and any Participant, beneficiary, legal representative, or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts. The Plan is not subject to the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time. 

^^**No Constraint on Corporate Action.** Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to (i) limit, impair, or otherwise affect the Company’s right or power to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure, or to merge or consolidate, or dissolve, liquidate, sell, or transfer all or any part of its business or assets, or (ii) limit the right or power of the Company to take any action which such entity deems to be necessary or appropriate. 

^^**Successors.** All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company. 

^^**Governing Law.** The Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. 

^^**Waiver of Certain Claims.** By participating in the Plan, the Participant waives all and any rights to compensation or damages in consequence of the termination of his or her office or Service with the Company, any Subsidiary or Affiliate for any reason whatsoever, whether lawfully or otherwise, insofar as those rights arise or may arise from his or her ceasing to have rights under the Plan as a result of such termination, or from the loss or diminution in value of such rights or entitlements, including by reason of the operation of the terms of the Plan, any determination by the Board or Committee pursuant to a discretion contained in the Plan or any Award Agreement or the provisions of any statute or law relating to taxation. 

^^**Data Protection.** By participating in the Plan, the Participant consents to the collection, processing, transmission and storage by the Company in any form whatsoever, of any data of a professional or personal nature which is necessary for the purposes of introducing and administering the Plan. The Company may share such information with any Subsidiary or Affiliate, the trustee of any employee benefit trust, its registrars, trustees, brokers, other third party administrator or any Person who obtains control of the Company or acquires the Company, undertaking or part-undertaking which employs the Participant, wherever situated. 

^^**Effective Date.** The Plan shall be effective as of the date of adoption by the Board, which date is set forth below (the “Effective Date”).
