^^**Advances**. All Advances are subject to the conditions and requirements contained in this Agreement. Advances shall be made only once each Draw Period. Advances will be made only for actual costs incurred to third parties in accordance with the Budget and other provisions hereof. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all Advances will be deposited in the Advance Account; provided that if not all of the conditions to an Advance have been satisfied, or if an Event of Default exists, but Lender elects to make such Advance, then Lender shall have the unconditional right, exercisable in Lender's sole discretion, to make such Advance, in whole or in part, to one or more of (i) directly to Borrower by depositing same in the Advance Account, (ii) directly to the Contractor, Design Professional, or other third party owed, and/or (iii) jointly to the Borrower and any one or more of the Contractor, Design Professional, or other third party owed. Borrower will hold the Advances in the Advance Account (until payment to the proper payee) as a trust fund for the purpose of paying the cost of construction of the Improvements and related nonconstruction costs contained in the Draw Request pursuant to which such Advance was made. Borrower will apply the same promptly to the payment of the costs and expenses for which each Advance is made and will not use any part thereof for any other purpose.

^^**Allocations**. The purposes for which the Loan proceeds are allocated and the respective amounts of such Allocations are set forth in the Budget. Loan proceeds shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth in the Budget and only until the Loan Extension. Lender shall not be obligated to make an Advance from an Allocation set forth in the Budget to the extent that the amount of the Advance for such Allocation would, when added to all prior Advances for such Allocation, exceed the total of such Allocation as set forth in the Budget. Lender shall not be obligated to make an Advance from an allocation for "Contingency" as set forth in the Budget; all Loan proceeds provided in a "Contingency" Allocation in the Budget must be reallocated pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof as a condition to the Advance of such proceeds.

^^**Reallocations**. Borrower shall not be entitled to require that Lender reallocate Loan proceeds from any Allocation to any other Allocations. Borrower may request Lender to make a reallocation of Loan proceeds among one or more Allocations (including any "Contingency" Allocation) in the Budget; provided, however, any such reallocation shall be in Lender's sole and absolute discretion, except Lender shall not unreasonably withhold its consent for a requested Reallocation from a "Contingency" to another Allocation. To the extent the amount of the Loan proceeds actually needed and disbursed for any Allocation is less than the amount of the Allocation, and the use of those Loan proceeds are not otherwise reallocated as herein provided, then such unused Loan proceeds shall not be available for Advances. If any Loan proceeds are reallocated at the request of Borrower and in accordance with this Section 2.6, then the Budget shall be deemed amended in accordance with such reallocation. Lender reserves the right, at its option, to disburse, while an Event of Default exists, Loan proceeds allocated to any of the Allocations for such other purposes or in such different proportions as Lender may, in its sole discretion, deem necessary or advisable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall have the right to reallocate amounts in any Allocation (exclusive of the Allocations for the interest reserve or reserves for taxes and insurance) to any other Allocation in an amount not to exceed $[[USD Value 3: Number]] per any individual reallocation, and $[[USD Value 2]], in the aggregate, from any such Allocation, whether made at one or multiple times, upon prior written notice to Lender (a "**Permitted Reallocation**").

LOAN AGREEMENT – Page 10         
^^**Limitation on Advances**. Lender may withhold from an Advance or, on account of subsequently discovered evidence, withhold from a later Advance or require Borrower to repay to Lender the whole or any part of any earlier Advance, to the extent necessary to protect Lender from loss on account of (i) obligations of Borrower to be performed pursuant to the Loan Documents on or before the subject date that have not been performed; (ii) defective work not remedied, (iii) liens filed or reasonable evidence indicating probable filing of liens, (iv) the failure of Borrower to make payments to the Contractor or subcontractors for material or labor, or (v) a reasonable doubt by Lender that the construction of the Improvements can be completed for the sum of (A) the balance of the Loan then undisbursed, (B) the balance of any undisbursed Borrower's Deposits, and (C) the balance of any other deposits made by Borrower into a Special Account with Lender for any of the foregoing purposes. When all such grounds are cured, Borrower may request the Advance of any amount so withheld because of the foregoing.

^^**Time and Place of Advances**. Lender shall require five (5) Business Days prior receipt of a Draw Request with all required supporting items before the making of any Advance. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all Advances will be made by direct deposit into the Advance Account.

^^**Payments by Lender**. At any time that an Event of Default exists, Lender may, in Lender's sole discretion and option, without the request or consent of Borrower, pay, or make an Advance of any amount which has not been disbursed under the Loan to pay, all or any portion of (i) accrued but unpaid interest under the Loan Documents to Lender; (ii) any or all costs of or related to construction of the Improvements by check or wire transfer directly to the parties entitled thereto as determined by Lender; (iii) any fees, charges, or expenses payable by Borrower to Lender pursuant to any of the Loan Documents; and (iv) any or all other expenses or amounts incurred or paid by Lender that are payable or reimbursable by Borrower to Lender pursuant to any of the Loan Documents; provided that Lender shall have no obligation to make any such payments or Advances. Lender can make any such payments or Advances from time to time in whole or in part, and in any order, that Lender determines in its sole discretion. Lender, at its option, may make any such Advance of Loan proceeds by debiting the Loan in the amount of the Advance and disbursing such amount to itself or any other payee. For these purposes, Lender is not restricted to the Allocations set forth in the Budget, and Lender shall have the right, at its option, to disburse Loan proceeds allocated to any of the Allocations for such other purposes and in such different proportions as Lender may, in its sole discretion, deem necessary or advisable. At any time that an Event of Default exists, if Lender elects, in Lender's sole discretion, to make any such payments with an Advance of Loan proceeds, such payments shall be treated as an Advance for all purposes, shall be due and payable by Borrower on the date the principal of the Note is due and payable, and shall accrue interest at the rate that the principal of the Note accrues interest. Any payments made by Lender in accordance with this Section (that Lender does not elect to treat as an Advance, shall be deemed Costs (as defined in the Deed to Secure Debt), shall constitute Indebtedness secured by the Deed to Secure Debt and other applicable Loan Documents, and shall be payable and accrue interest, as provided in the Deed to Secure Debt, unless the Loan Documents expressly provided otherwise with respect to such payments.

LOAN AGREEMENT – Page 11         
^^**Estoppel Certificate**. Borrower will deliver to Lender from time to time, within five (5) Business Days after request therefor, an estoppel certificate or written statement, duly acknowledged, stating the amount of Loan proceeds that have been disbursed to Borrower, the amount due on the Note, and whether any offsets or defenses exist against the Note or any of the other Loan Documents.

^^**Interest Reserve**. Lender may disburse, from time to time during the term of the Loan, but not after the Loan Extension, as interest becomes due and payable, Loan proceeds by journal entry to pay accrued but unpaid interest on the Loan in an aggregate amount not exceeding the interest reserve Allocation in the Budget, and such journal entry payment shall constitute an Advance. At any time, Lender may evaluate the sufficiency of the interest reserve Allocation, exercising its reasonable judgment in light of (i) cost overruns or change orders; (ii) failure of the Improvements to be completed in a timely manner in accordance with the Construction Schedule, or (iii) other factors. If Lender determines that the interest reserve Allocation is not sufficient, Lender may, in Lender's sole discretion and at Lender's option, (i) require a Borrower's Deposit for the deficiency, (ii) exercise its rights under Section 2.9 hereof, or (iii) make written demand on Borrower to pay all future interest out of Borrower's own funds until the undisbursed portion of the interest reserve Allocation is sufficient in Lender's reasonable judgment to cover any and all such amounts to become due with respect thereto.

^^**Loan Extension**. The Loan may be extended (the "**Loan Extension**") two (2) times for twelve (12) months each upon written request ("**Loan Extension Notice**") by Borrower to Lender not less than thirty (30) Business Days before the earlier of the requested date for the Loan Extension or the original Maturity Date (or the Maturity Date after the first Loan Extension, if applicable), and achievement by Borrower, to the satisfaction of Lender, of each of the following conditions, except to the extent that Lender has waived, in writing and in Lender's sole discretion, any such condition:

Notwithstanding the failure of the Property to achieve the aforesaid required Debt Service Coverage Ratio, Borrower shall have the right to pay to Lender, before the then Maturity Date, an amount of principal sufficient for the Property to meet such required Debt Service Coverage Ratio and thereby satisfy such test. Borrower shall have delivered to Lender with the Loan Extension Notice a Compliance Certificate reflecting the applicable Debt Service Coverage Ratio.

Master Lessee shall have delivered to Lender an estoppel certificate, in form and substance acceptable to Lender, certifying that, to the best knowledge of Master Lessee, as of the date of the applicable Loan Extension, there is no default or fact or circumstance which with the giving of notice or passage of time, or both, could constitute a default, under the Sublease.

^^**Satisfactions and Representations for Advances**. Before any Advance is made, all applicable conditions to the Advance must have been satisfied at Borrower's sole cost and expense in a manner acceptable to Lender. Borrower acknowledges that delays in an Advance may result from the time required by Lender to verify satisfactory fulfillment of any and all conditions to a given Advance, and hereby consents to such delays. Unless Lender has provided its agreement in writing to the contrary, each Draw Request constitutes Borrower's representation and warranty to Lender that (i) all prior disbursements, as well as that currently being requested, were and will be used in strict compliance with the Budget, the approved Draw Requests, and the other Loan Documents, (ii) no Event of Default exists, and no event exists that, with notice and/or the passage of time, could become a default or event of default under any of the Loan Documents, (iii) all applicable conditions in this Agreement for the subject Advance have been satisfied; and (iv) the undisbursed proceeds of the Loan together with the balance of the Advance Account and the balance of any Special Account established for the following purposes are sufficient to pay all costs related to completion of the Improvements (including issuance of all permits, licenses, and certificates related to the completion and use), plus other costs which may accrue related to the Improvements or the Land during the construction period, plus any other unpaid costs contained in the Budget.

A Draw Request must state the date the Advance is requested, which shall be at least five (5) Business Days after Lender receives the Draw Request. All Draw Requests shall account for the retainage and other withholdings required pursuant to Section 3.6 hereof. Without limiting any of the other provisions in this Agreement, Lender shall not be required to approve any Draw Request or make an Advance if (i) any cost requested in the Draw Request is not set forth in the Budget, (ii) the requested amount, when added to all prior Advances and any applicable retention requirements for such line item, would exceed the lesser of (A) the actual cost incurred by Borrower for such item, or (B) the sum allocated in the Budget for such line item, or (iii) an amount is requested directly from a contingency line item.

^^**Borrower's Deposit**. If at any time and from time to time Lender shall in its sole discretion deem that the undisbursed proceeds of the Loan, plus the then balance of the Advance Account and any Special Account to be applied to construction costs of the Improvements, are insufficient to meet the costs of completing construction of the Improvements (including all unpaid nonconstruction costs, costs for work and materials completed or provided but not paid for, and all costs of work and materials not completed or provided), plus the costs of insurance, ad valorem taxes, and other normal costs related to the Property, plus any other unpaid costs contained in the Budget, Lender may refuse to make any additional Advances to Borrower hereunder until Borrower shall have deposited with Lender in the Advance Account or a Special Account, as Lender may require, sufficient additional funds as a Borrower's Deposit to cover the deficiency which Lender deems to exist. Such Borrower's Deposit will be disbursed by Lender to Borrower pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof as if they constituted a portion of the Loan proceeds, prior to the Advance of any Loan proceeds. Borrower agrees to establish such Special Account (if applicable) and make the Borrower's Deposit into the Advance Account or Special Account, as applicable, within fifteen (15) days after written demand by Lender. Unless required by Governmental Requirements, Lender shall not be required to pay interest on the Borrower's Deposit.

^^**Retainage**. An amount equal to the Retainage Percentage of all hard costs of construction under the Construction Contract and any and all subcontracts entered into by a Contractor for which an Advance has been made, **plus** the amount of any claims asserted by any laborers or materialmen against any portion of the Property pursuant to stop notices, lien claims or similar demands or notices received by Lender (which have not been bonded against or otherwise secured in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Deed to Secure Debt), shall not be disbursed by Lender. Such retainage shall be disbursed by Lender to Borrower, excluding the amount of any such unbonded or unsecured lien claims, plus potential costs and interest related thereto (which funds will be disbursed only as such claims are resolved satisfactorily bonded around in addition to the satisfaction of the following conditions), when all of the following have occurred to the satisfaction of Lender:

^^Lender has received the Certificate of Substantial Completion executed by Borrower and the appropriate Design Professional, and approved by the Inspector, stating that the Improvements have been completed in accordance with the Plans.

^^Lender shall have received such other evidence as Lender may require that no mechanics' or materialmen's liens or other encumbrances have been filed and remain in effect against the Property, and the time periods for the filing of any stop notice or lien claim with respect to the construction of the Improvements shall have elapsed without the filing or providing of any such stop notice or lien claim. The Design Professional, Contractor, and all subcontractors and material suppliers who performed or provided work or materials related to the Improvements have been paid in full, subject to the release of the retainage as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 3.6.

^^Each applicable Governmental Authority shall have duly inspected and approved the Improvements and the occupancy of same and issued the appropriate permit, license or certificate of occupancy, to evidence such approval.

^^All conditions to an Advance contained in **Sections 3.1** and 3.2 are satisfied.

^^Thirty (30) days shall have elapsed from the later of (i) the date of the completion of the Improvements, if such Affidavit of Completion is filed within ten (10) days after such date of completion, or (ii) the date of filing of such Affidavit of Completion if such Affidavit of Completion is filed ten (10) days or more after the date of the completion of the Improvements.

If Lender makes an Advance before fulfillment of one or more conditions to such Advance, Lender may require fulfillment of such conditions before making any subsequent Advance. No Advance shall constitute a waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement or of any Event of Default, nor of any default or event of default under any of the other Loan Documents, nor shall any Advance have the effect of precluding Lender from pursuing Lender's rights or remedies with respect to any such breach, Event of Default, or other default.

LOAN AGREEMENT – Page 20         
^^**Advance not an Approval**. The making of any Advance shall not be deemed an approval or acceptance by Lender of any work, materials, or other matters related to the construction of the Improvements, the Property, or any actions taken in connection therewith.

^^**Funds Transfer Disbursements**. Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to disburse the proceeds of the Loan pursuant to the Loan Documents as requested by an authorized representative of the Borrower.

If Lender takes any actions in an attempt to detect errors in the transmission or content of transfer or requests or takes any actions in an attempt to detect unauthorized funds transfer requests, Borrower agrees that no matter how many times Lender takes these actions Lender will not in any situation be liable for failing to take or correctly perform these actions in the future and such actions shall not become any part of the transfer disbursement procedures authorized under this provision, the Loan Documents, or any agreement between Lender and Borrower. Lender will, in its sole discretion, determine the funds transfer system and the means by which each transfer will be made. Lender may delay or refuse to accept a funds transfer request if the transfer would: (i) require use of a bank unacceptable to Lender or prohibited by government authority, (ii) cause Lender to violate any Federal Reserve or other regulatory risk control program or guideline, or (iii) otherwise cause Lender to violate any applicable law or regulation. Lender shall not be liable to Borrower or any other parties for (i) errors, acts or failures to act of others, including other entities, banks, communications carriers or clearinghouses, through which Borrower's transfers may be made or information received or transmitted, and no such entity shall be deemed an agent of the Lender, (ii) any loss, liability or delay caused by fires, earthquakes, wars, civil disturbances, power surges or failures, acts of government, labor disputes, failures in communications networks, legal constraints or other events beyond Lender's control, or (iii) unless due to the willful misconduct of Lender, any special, consequential, indirect or punitive damages, whether or not (A) any claim for these damages is based on tort or contract, or (B) Lender or Borrower knew or should have known the likelihood of these damages in any situation. Lender makes no representations or warranties other than those expressly made in this Agreement.

Each insurance policy issued in connection herewith shall provide by way of endorsements, riders or otherwise that: (i) the coverage of Lender shall not be terminated, reduced, or affected in any manner regardless of any breach or violation by Borrower of any warranties, declarations, or conditions in such policy; (ii) no such insurance policy shall be canceled, endorsed, altered, or reissued to effect a change in coverage for any reason and to any extent whatsoever unless such insurer shall have first given Lender thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof; and (iii) Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, make premium payments to prevent any cancellations, endorsement, alteration, or reissuance, and such payments shall be accepted by the insurer to prevent same. Lender shall be furnished with a certificate of insurance for each policy and if requested by Lender, a copy of each such initial policy coincident with the execution hereof and a certificate of insurance for each policy and if requested by Lender, the a copy of each renewal policy not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the initial or applicable renewal policy and a certificate of insurance for such policy, together with receipts or other evidence that the premiums thereon have been paid for one (1) year. Borrower may satisfy the requirements hereof by use of a so-called "blanket policy," provided that the coverage is not diminished and the coverage is separately and individually allocated to the Property. As further security for the Loan, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender all unearned premiums on any such policy, and agrees that any and all unexpired insurance shall inure to the benefit of, and pass to, Lender (or any other purchaser) upon acquisition by Lender (or such purchaser) of the Property, or any applicable portion thereof, through foreclosure proceedings.

Borrower shall promptly pay all premiums when due on any such policies and renewals thereof and shall furnish Lender with written evidence of such payment. In the event Borrower fails to provide insurance complying with the provisions hereof or fails to pay the premium therefor, Lender may, but without obligation so to do, without notice to the Borrower, without demand upon Borrower, without releasing Borrower from any obligation hereof, and without curing any Event of Default, obtain insurance, in any amounts determined by Lender, through or from any insurance agency or insurer or insurance underwriter acceptable to Lender, and pay the premium therefor, and Lender by doing so shall not be chargeable with obtaining or maintaining such insurance or for the collection of any insurance monies or for any insolvency of any insurer or insurance company. Any such insurance obtained by Lender shall be solely for the benefit and protection of Lender, and cannot be relied on by Borrower for protection of Borrower or any of its interests in the Property. All such costs incurred by Lender shall be part of the Indebtedness and shall accrue interest at the Default Rate from the date paid by Lender until repaid. Lender, from time to time, may furnish to any insurance agency or company, or any other person, any information contained in or extracted from any insurance policy theretofore delivered to Lender pursuant hereto, and any information concerning the Loan, Borrower, or the Property. If at any time Borrower obtains insurance related to the Property or the ownership, operation, or income thereof, which is not specifically required by Lender, then Borrower shall nevertheless include Lender as additional insured or loss payee/mortgagee thereto.

To the extent that the Master Lease or the Sublease requires Borrower to carry any types of insurance in amounts greater than those required by the Loan Documents or with exclusions from coverage narrower than those permitted by the Loan Documents, such that compliance with the requirements in the Loan Documents alone might result in a breach of either or both of the Master Lease or the Sublease, Borrower shall, in addition to complying with the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents, provide, maintain, and keep in force the insurance policies required under the Master Lease and the Sublease.

The date of commencement of work set forth in such Affidavit of Commencement shall not be the date of or prior to the date on which the Deed to Secure Debt was recorded. If permitted or required by applicable law, Borrower shall file on or before the deadline therefor as established by applicable law, an affidavit or certificate ("**Affidavit of Completion**") of completion of construction of the Improvements, in the appropriate records in the county in which the Land is situated, and shall send a copy of such Affidavit of Completion to each contractor and person as contemplated and within the time frames prescribed by applicable law.

^^**Defects and Variances**. Borrower will, upon demand by Lender and at Borrower's sole expense, promptly correct any structural defect in the Improvements or any variance from the Plans not approved in writing by Lender, it being understood and agreed that the disbursement of any Loan proceeds shall not constitute a waiver of Lender's right to require compliance with respect to any such defects or departures. If Lender in its reasonable judgment determines that any work or materials fail to conform to any Governmental Requirements, any Legal Requirements or the Plans, or that they otherwise depart from any of the requirements of this Agreement, then Lender may require the nonconforming or defective work to be stopped and withhold its consent to further Advances until the nonconformity or defect, as applicable, is corrected. If this occurs, Borrower must correct the work to Lender's reasonable satisfaction promptly and halt all other work which may be affected by the nonconforming or defective work pending completion of such corrective work. No such action by Lender will affect Borrower's obligation to complete the Improvements on or before the Completion Date.

^^**Surveys**. Borrower will furnish to Lender, at Borrower's expense, the following surveys prepared by a registered engineer or surveyor acceptable to Lender: (i) a pre-construction title survey of the Land and any existing improvements thereon, prepared by a registered surveyor or engineer and certified to Lender, Borrower, and the Title Company, with a certification in form and substance acceptable to Lender, reflecting such matters as required by Lender and showing no state of facts objectionable to Lender; (ii) if requested by Lender, a foundation survey, upon completion of staking the foundation or completion of the foundation for the Improvements, showing the location of the foundation and all building and set-back lines, property boundary lines, and other matters customarily included in a foundation survey for the type of property and improvements being surveyed; and (iii) an "as built" survey, within sixty (60) days after substantial completion of the Improvements, showing the locations of the Improvements, and certifying that same are entirely within the property lines of the Land, do not encroach upon any easement, setback or building line or restrictions, and are placed in accordance with the Plans, all Governmental Requirements, and all Legal Requirements affecting the Land and/or Improvements, and showing and certifying to such other matters customarily shown and contained in certifications for an "as built" survey for the type of property and improvements being surveyed, and showing no state of facts objectionable to Lender. All surveys shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lender.

The soils report shall be based upon adequate due diligence, and shall state that there are no unusual or hazardous soil conditions in, on, under, or around the Property, that no condition or circumstance warranting further investigation or analysis exists in the opinion of the soils engineer, and that construction of all Improvements as proposed is feasible under existing soil conditions so long as the recommendations of the soils report are followed.

In addition to the appraisal contemplated in Section 3.1(d) hereof, Lender may, from time to time, obtain an appraisal of all or any part of the Property prepared by a third-party appraiser engaged directly by Lender and prepared in accordance with written instructions from Lender. Lender, in Lender's sole discretion, may (but shall have no obligation to) have any such appraisal reviewed by another appraiser. The cost of any such appraisal and review (if any) shall be borne by Borrower if (i) the appraisal is obtained to confirm compliance with any financial covenants of Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) is obtained at least 24 months after the last appraisal of the Property, or (iii) the appraisal is obtained after the occurrence of an Event of Default or otherwise required pursuant to applicable rules, regulations or statutes requiring Lender to obtain same.

Borrower agrees to reimburse Lender, on demand, for customary and reasonable fees and costs incurred by Lender for up to one audit each year (with each such year commencing on the date hereof); provided this shall in no way limit the number of audits that Lender can make nor shall it limit any other provisions contained in the Loan Documents (but shall be cumulative of all other provisions).

All amounts so expended by Lender in the exercise of any such remedies shall be deemed to have been disbursed to Borrower as Loan proceeds and secured by the Deed to Secure Debt.

The power of attorney under this Section shall terminate upon payment of the Indebtedness in full or upon foreclosure (or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure) of all of the Property. Lender shall incur no liability if any action taken by it as attorney-in-fact as permitted above shall prove to be inadequate, invalid, or in poor judgment, so long as Lender did not act with willful misconduct. **BORROWER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS LENDER FROM AND AGAINST ANY LOSS, COST, LIABILITY, OR EXPENSE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES) INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACTION (EXCLUDING LENDER'S WILLFUL MISCONDUCT).** **THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY SHALL APPLY WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS WHICH IN WHOLE OR IN PART ARE CAUSED BY OR ARISE OUT OF THE NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, COMPARATIVE, OR CONTRIBUTORY) OF LENDER, BUT SHALL NOT APPLY TO MATTERS TO THE EXTENT SUCH MATTERS ARE CAUSED BY OR ARISE OUT OF THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF LENDER.**All rights and remedies of Lender are cumulative.

^^**Construction**. The Article, Section, and Subsection titles hereof are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way alter, modify, define, or be used in construing the text of such Articles, Sections, or Subsections. Time is of the essence in the performance of the covenants contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, provided that if any time period for performance ends on a day which is not a Business Day, then such period shall be deemed to end on the next succeeding Business Day.

^^**Survival**. This Agreement and the terms, provisions, and conditions hereof shall survive and continue in full force and effect until Lender's obligation to make Advances has terminated and the entire Indebtedness and all Obligations have been fully paid and performed; provided that all indemnities contained in this Agreement shall survive the payment and performance of the Indebtedness and the Obligations, the release, partial release, or foreclosure (or action in lieu of foreclosure) of the lien of the Deed to Secure Debt, and the exercise by Lender of any and all remedies set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents.

^^**Applicable Law**. **THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTE, AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES.** Borrower hereby irrevocably: (i) agrees that any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with any of the Loan Documents shall be brought in the applicable state court in the county in Dallas County, Texas, or in the United States District Court that encompasses such county; (ii) submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any such action or proceeding; and (iii) waives any objection it may now or hereafter have as to the venue of any such action or proceeding brought in any such court or that any such court is an inconvenient forum.

^^**Notices**. All notices or other communications required or permitted to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly given when given as provided in the Note.

LOAN AGREEMENT – Page 43         
^^**No Obligation by Lender to Construct**. Lender has no liability or obligation whatsoever or howsoever in connection with the Property or the development, construction, or completion thereof or work performed thereon, and has no obligation except to disburse the Loan proceeds as agreed in the Loan Documents. Lender has no duty to inspect the construction of the Improvements, and if Lender (including any Inspector or other person or entity on behalf of Lender) should inspect the construction of the Improvements, Lender shall have no liability or obligation to Borrower or any other party or third person arising out of such inspection. No such inspection nor any failure by Lender to make objections after any such inspection shall constitute a representation by Lender that the Improvements are in accordance with the Plans, Governmental Requirements, or any other requirement, or constitute a waiver of Lender's right thereafter to insist that the Improvements be constructed in accordance with the Plans, all Governmental Requirements, or any other requirement or constitute a waiver of any breach, Event of Default, or other matter. Lender is not liable or responsible, and under no circumstances whatsoever shall Lender be or become liable or responsible, for the performance or default of Borrower or any Contractor or subcontractor, or for any failure to construct, complete, protect, or insure the Improvements or the Property, or any part thereof, or for the payment of any cost or expense incurred in connection therewith, or for the performance or nonperformance of any obligation of Borrower or any Guarantor, and Lender makes no representation regarding any of the foregoing. Nothing, including any Advance, payment by Lender of any obligation of Borrower or others, exercise by Lender of any of its rights and remedies, approval of any matter, or acceptance of any document or instrument, shall be construed as an assumption of liability, undertaking, representation, or warranty, express or implied, on Lender's part unless expressly agreed in writing by Lender.

^^**Lender Approvals and Requirements**. Lender's approval (which shall include any approval or consent by Lender or Lender's representatives) of any matter in connection with the Loan shall be for the sole purpose of protecting Lender's security and rights. No such approval shall result in an assumption of any liability or obligation, nor result in a waiver of any breach or default of Borrower. In no event shall Lender's approval be a representation, warranty, or undertaking by Lender of any kind with regard to the matter being approved. Without limiting the foregoing, no approval by Lender related to the Plans, the Budget, the Construction Schedule, a Construction Contract, a Design Services Contract, a Draw Request, any construction, or any other matter, shall, in any way, be deemed to imply any warranty, representation, or covenant by Lender, including that the Improvements, if so constructed, will be structurally sound, will conform to any standards or requirements, will comply with the Plans or any or all restrictive covenants, Governmental Requirements, or other requirements, will be fit for any particular purpose, or will have a particular market value. Except only as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents that Lender's "reasonable" discretion or approval is needed, as to matters referenced in the Loan Documents that require the consent or approval by Lender, or that involve a determination by Lender of whether something is acceptable or satisfactory to Lender, such consent, approval, or determination may be granted or denied in Lender's sole and absolute discretion, and no consent or approval shall be effective unless the same is expressly set forth in writing by Lender. In no event shall any other act nor any omission on the part of Lender be construed as a consent or approval nor serve to later estop Lender's right to withhold its consent or approval as to a particular matter. The purpose of all requirements (including conditions to Advances) of Lender under the Loan Documents is solely to allow Lender to protect Lender and Lender's interests with respect to the Loan. Neither Borrower, any Guarantor or Constituent Party, nor any third party shall have the right to rely on any requirements, reviews, or procedures required, obtained, or conducted by Lender, Borrower hereby acknowledging that Borrower has sole responsibility for all matters related to the Property and operations and construction related thereto.

^^**Relationship of Parties**. Nothing herein shall be construed as making or constituting Lender as an agent (except with respect to Lender's rights as attorney-in-fact granted in this Agreement) or partner of Borrower. Borrower hereby expressly acknowledges that no term or condition of the Loan Documents shall be construed so as to deem the relationship between Borrower, any Guarantor and Lender to be other then that of borrower, guarantors and lender, and Borrower shall at all times represent that the relationship between Borrower, any Guarantor and Lender is solely that of borrower, guarantors and lender.

^^**Severability**. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall, for any reason and to any extent, be held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, nor the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances to the extent lawful, but such provision shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law.

LOAN AGREEMENT – Page 44         
^^**Participations**. Lender may assign the Note, or participation interests in the Note, and any related rights under the Loan Documents, without notice to or the consent of Borrower or any Constituent Party or Guarantor. Lender may, in connection with any such assignment, participation, or proposed assignment or participation, disclose any nonpublic information relating to Borrower, any Constituent Party, any Guarantor, and their affiliates furnished to Lender by or on behalf of Borrower, a Constituent Party, a Guarantor, or their affiliates, including, without limitation, any and all information received by Lender regarding their creditworthiness, business operations, financial statements, Property, and all contracts, leases, and operations related to the Property. Lender shall have any participant or potential participant agree to keep confidential any such information received from Lender.

^^**Usury Savings Provision**. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, it is the intent of Lender and Borrower to conform strictly to all applicable usury laws. Lender and Borrower agree that regardless of any agreement, contingency, event, or act, the interest contracted for, taken, received, reserved, or charged, directly or indirectly, by Lender in connection with the Loan shall not exceed the maximum rate or amount of interest Lender may contract for, take, receive, reserve, or charge under applicable laws. The provisions contained in the Note (related to not exceeding the maximum rate or amount of interest permitted by law) are incorporated in this Agreement for all purposes.

^^**Controlling Document**. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any other Loan Document, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

^^**Consumer Protection Waiver**. To the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, Borrower hereby waives the provisions of any and all consumer protection laws. It is the intent of Lender and Borrower that the rights and remedies with respect to this transaction shall be governed by legal principles other than those governing consumer protection. The waiver set forth herein shall expressly survive the termination of the referenced transaction and is expressly acknowledged by Borrower.

^^**Counterparts**. To facilitate execution, this instrument may be executed in as many counterparts as may be convenient or required. It shall not be necessary that the signature of, or on behalf of, each party, or that the signature of all persons required to bind any party appear on each counterpart. All counterparts shall collectively constitute a single instrument. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this instrument to produce or account for more than a single counterpart containing the respective signatures of, or on behalf of, each of the parties hereto. Any signature page to any counterpart may be detached from such counterpart without impairing the legal effect of the signatures thereon and thereafter attached to another counterpart identical thereto except having attached to it additional signature pages.

^^**WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY**. LENDER AND BORROWER, UNCONDITIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY, EACH WAIVES, RELINQUISHES, AND FOREVER FORGOES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THE LOAN, THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AND/OR ANY ACTION TAKEN IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, INCLUDING THOSE BASED ON OR ARISING FROM AN ALLEGED CONTRACT CLAIM, TORT, STATUTE, CONSTITUTION, OR OTHER. BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WAIVER IS MADE VOLUNTARILY, KNOWINGLY, AND WITH FULL AWARENESS OF THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES.

LOAN AGREEMENT – Page 45         
^^**ENTIRE AGREEMENT**. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS INSTRUMENT MAY BE AMENDED ONLY BY AN INSTRUMENT IN WRITING EXECUTED BY THE PARTIES HERETO.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have signed this Agreement.
