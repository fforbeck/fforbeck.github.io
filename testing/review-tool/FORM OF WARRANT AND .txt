^^ \centered 2.2 Execution and Delivery of Warrant Certificates; Vesting. 

^^^ \centered (a) Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Warrant Certificates evidencing such total number of Warrants to be delivered to each Initial Investor as set forth on Schedule A shall be executed by the Company and delivered to the Warrant Agent for countersignature, by manual or facsimile signature, and the Warrant Agent shall thereupon countersign and deliver such Warrant Certificates to each Initial Investor (or their designee(s) in accordance with the last sentence of this Section 2.2(a)). The Warrant Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its President or a Vice President, either manually or by facsimile signature printed thereon. Each Initial Investor, in its sole discretion, may designate that some or all of its Warrants and Warrant Certificates be issued in the name of, and delivered to, one or more of the members of its Purchaser Group. 

^^^ \centered (b) The Warrants evidenced by the Warrant Certificates delivered pursuant to Section 2.2(a) shall vest in the amounts and at the times set forth on Schedule A; provided, that any Warrants delivered to an Initial Investor (or their designee(s) in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.2(a)) that have not vested on or prior to the first date on which (x) the Investment Agreement or Stock Purchase Agreement applicable with respect to such Initial Investor has been terminated in accordance with its terms and (y) the Warrant Agent has received written notice from the Company of such termination, shall no longer be eligible for vesting and shall be deemed cancelled. 

^^^ \centered (c) From time to time, the Warrant Agent shall countersign and deliver Warrant Certificates in required denominations to Persons entitled thereto in connection with any transfer or exchange permitted under this Agreement. The Warrant Agent is hereby irrevocably (but subject to Article 9) authorized to countersign and deliver Warrant Certificates as required by Section 2.2, Section 3.4, Article 7, and Section 12.4 or otherwise as provided herein. The Warrant Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its President or a Vice President, either manually or by facsimile signature printed thereon. The Warrant Certificates shall be countersigned by the Warrant Agent, either manually or by facsimile signature, and shall not be valid for any purpose unless so countersigned. In case any officer of the Company whose signature shall have been placed upon any of the Warrant Certificates shall cease to be such  
^^^ \centered    


^^^ \centered officer of the Company before countersignature by the Warrant Agent and issue and delivery thereof, such Warrant Certificates may, nevertheless, be countersigned by the Warrant Agent, either manually or by facsimile signature printed thereon, and issued and delivered with the same force and effect as though such Person had not ceased to be such officer of the Company 

^^^ \centered (d) No Warrant Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, and no Warrant evidenced thereby may be exercised, unless such Warrant Certificate has been countersigned by the manual or facsimile signature of the Warrant Agent.

^ \centered 3. EXERCISE PRICE; EXERCISE OF WARRANTS AND EXPIRATION OF WARRANTS. 

^^ \centered 3.1 Exercise Price.

For the avoidance of doubt, Warrants that have not vested in accordance with Schedule A may not be exercised. 

^^ \centered 3.3 Expiration of Warrants. Any unexercised Warrants shall expire and the rights of the Holders of such Warrants to purchase Underlying Common Stock shall terminate at the close of business on [ ], 2017(1) (the “Expiration Date”). 

^^ \centered 3.4 Method of Exercise; Settlement of Warrant. In order to exercise a Warrant, the Holder thereof must (i) surrender the Warrant Certificate evidencing such Warrant to the Warrant Agent, with the form on the reverse of or attached to the Warrant Certificate properly completed and duly executed (the date of the surrender of such Warrant Certificate, the “Exercise Date”), and (ii) if Net Share Settlement is not elected, deliver in full the aggregate Exercise Price then in effect for the shares of Underlying Common Stock as to which a Warrant Certificate is submitted for exercise, not later than the Settlement Date as more fully set forth herein. Full Physical Settlement shall apply to each Warrant unless the Holder elects for Net Share Settlement to apply upon exercise of such Warrant. Such election shall be made in the form on the reverse of or attached to the Warrant Certificate for such Warrant.   
^Note to Draft: Insert the date that is the seventh anniversary of the date of this Agreement.


^^^ \centered (a) If Full Physical Settlement is applicable with respect to the exercise of a Warrant, then, for each Warrant exercised hereunder (i) prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Settlement Date for such Warrant, the Holder shall pay the aggregate Exercise Price (determined as of such Exercise Date) for the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable upon exercise of such Warrant at such time by federal wire or other immediately available funds payable to the order of the Company to the account maintained by the Warrant Agent and notified to the Holder upon request of the Holder, and (ii) on the Settlement Date, following receipt by the Warrant Agent of such Exercise Price, the Company shall cause to be delivered to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable upon exercise of each Warrant at such time (the “Full Physical Share Amount”), together with cash in respect of any fractional shares of Common Stock as provided in Section 3.4(f). 

^^^ \centered (b) If Net Share Settlement is applicable with respect to the exercise of a Warrant, then, for each Warrant exercised hereunder, on the Settlement Date for such Warrant, the Company shall cause to be delivered to the Holder a number of shares of Common Stock (which in no event will be less than zero) (the “Net Share Amount”) equal to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable upon exercise of such Warrant at such time, multiplied by (ii) the Closing Sale Price on the relevant Exercise Date, minus the Exercise Price (determined as of such Exercise Date), divided by (iii) such Closing Sale Price, together with cash in respect of any fractional shares of Common Stock as provided in Section 3.4(f).

The underwriting provisions set forth in Section 4.1(e) hereof shall apply to an underwritten public offering requested by a Holder using such Shelf Registration Statement effected pursuant to this Section 4.1(a), provided, that the limitations set forth in Section 4.1(e) shall only apply with respect to such underwritten public offering and not more generally to the Shelf Registration Statement. 

^^^ \centered (b) Subject to the conditions of this Section 4.1, if the Company shall receive from any Holder or group of Holders (such Holder or group of Holders, the “Initiating Holder(s)”), a written request that the Company effect a registration with respect to Registrable Securities owned by such Initiating Holder(s) having an estimated aggregate Fair Market Value of at least $[[USD Value 3: Number]] million, the Company shall:

^^^^ \centered (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared or become effective as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than days after the date of initial filing of a Registration Statement pursuant to Section 4.1(b)(i); and 

^^^^ \centered (iii) use reasonable best efforts to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective and in compliance with the Securities Act and usable for resale of such Registrable Securities for the period as requested in writing by the Initiating Holder(s) or such longer period as may be requested in writing by any Holder participating in such registration (which periods shall be extended to the extent of any suspensions of sales pursuant to Sections 4.1(c) or 4.4);

^^^^ \centered provided, that (x) the number of demand registrations that the Brookfield Investors shall be entitled to effect pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) shall be no more than three such demand registrations in total and no more than one such demand registration in any 12-month period, (y) the number of demand registrations that The Fairholme Fund shall be entitled to effect pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) shall be no more than three such demand registrations in total and no more than one such demand registration in any 12-month period (The Fairholme Focused Income Fund will not be entitled to exercise demand registration rights under this Section 4.1(b)), and (z) the number of demand registrations that the Pershing Investors shall be entitled to effect pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) shall be no more than three such demand registrations in total and no more than one such demand registration in any 12-month period; provided, further, that the Company shall be permitted, with the consent of the Initiating Holder(s) not to be unreasonably withheld, to file a post-effective amendment or prospectus supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a) in lieu of an additional registration statement pursuant to Section 4.1(b) to the extent the Company reasonably determines that the Registrable Securities of the Initiating Holder(s) may be sold thereunder by such Initiating Holder(s) pursuant to their intended plan of distribution (in which case such post-effective amendment or demand registration statement shall not be counted against the limited number of demand registrations). It shall not be unreasonable if, following the recommendation of an underwriter, the Initiating Holder(s) do not consent to the Company filing a post-effective amendment or prospectus supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a) in lieu of an additional registration statement requested by the Initiating Holder(s). 

^^^ \centered (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be required to effect a registration pursuant to this Section 4.1: (i) with respect to securities that are not Registrable Securities; (ii) subject to Section 4.1(h), during any Scheduled Black-Out Period; or (iii) if the Company has notified the Holders that in the good faith judgment of the Company, it would be materially detrimental to the Company or its security holders for such registration to be effected at such time, in which event the Company shall have the right to defer such registration for a period of not more than days; provided that (A) such right to delay a registration pursuant to clause (iii) shall be exercised by the Company only if the Company has generally exercised (or is concurrently exercising) similar black-out rights against holders of similar securities that have registration rights, if any, and (B) any rights to delay registration pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) shall be subject to the Suspension Limit described in Section 4.4. 

^^^ \centered (d) If the Company shall determine to register any of its securities either (x) for its own account, (y) for the account of the Holders listed in Section 4.1(b) pursuant to the terms thereof, or (z) for the account of Other Stockholders (other than (A) a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans, (B) a registration relating solely to a Rule 145 transaction under the Securities Act or (C) a registration on any registration form which does not permit secondary sales or does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a Registration Statement), the Company will, subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 4.1(d):

Such written request may specify all or a part of the Holders’ Registrable Securities and shall be received by the Company within ten (10) days after written notice from the Company is given under Section 4.1(d)(i) above. 

^^^ \centered (e) If any Initiating Holder(s) intends to distribute Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 4.1(b) by means of an underwriting, it shall so advise the Company. In the case of such an underwritten offering, the price, underwriting discount and other financial terms for the Registrable Securities shall be determined by the Initiating Holder(s). If Other Stockholders or Holders, to the extent they have any registration rights under Section 4.1(d), request inclusion of their securities or Registrable Securities, respectively, in the underwriting, the Initiating Holder(s) shall offer to include such securities or Registrable Securities of such Other Stockholders or Holders, respectively, in the underwriting and may condition such offer on their acceptance of the further applicable provisions of this Section 4.1(e). The Holders whose Registrable Securities are to be included in such registration and the Company shall (together with all Other Stockholders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the Initiating Holder(s) subject to approval by the Company not to be unreasonably withheld (which underwriters may also include a non-bookrunning co-manager selected by the Company subject to approval by the Initiating Holder(s)); provided, however, that such underwriting agreement shall not provide for indemnification or contribution obligations on the part of any Holder greater than the obligations of the Holders under Sections 4.7(b) and 4.8. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.1(e), if the managing underwriter or underwriters advises the Holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of securities to be underwritten, some or all of the securities of the Company held by the Other Stockholders shall be excluded from such registration to the extent so required by such limitation. If, after the exclusion of such securities held by the Other Stockholders, further reductions are still required due to the marketing limitation, the number of Registrable Securities included in the registration by each Holder (including the Initiating Holder(s)) shall be reduced on a pro rata basis (based on the number of securities held by such Holders), by such minimum number of securities as is necessary to comply with such request. No Registrable Securities or any other securities excluded from the underwriting by reason of the underwriter’s marketing limitation shall be included in such registration. If any Holder or Other Stockholder who has requested inclusion in such registration as provided above disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, such Person may elect to withdraw therefrom by providing written notice to the Company, the underwriter and the Initiating Holder(s). The securities so withdrawn shall also be withdrawn from registration. If the underwriter has not limited the number of Registrable Securities or other securities to be underwritten, the Company and executive officers and directors of the Company (whether or not such Persons have registration rights pursuant to Section 4.1(d) hereof) may include its or their securities for its or their own account in such registration if the managing underwriter or underwriters and the Company so agree and if the number of Registrable Securities and other securities which would otherwise have been included in such registration and underwriting will not thereby be limited. The Company shall not be obligated to undertake more than (i) one

The Holders shall reasonably cooperate in connection with requests for underwritten offerings pursuant to this Section 4.1(e) to cause the total number of days that the Company shall be subject to lock-ups in connection with any such underwritten offerings not to exceed 120 days in any 365-day period. 

^^^ \centered (f) If the registration of which the Company gives notice pursuant to Section 4.1(d) is for a registered public offering involving an underwriting, the Company shall so advise each of the Holders as a part of the written notice given pursuant to Section 4.1(d) above. In such event, the right of each of the Holders to registration pursuant to Section 4.1(d) shall be conditioned upon such Holders’ participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holders’ Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. The Holders whose Registrable Securities are to be included in such registration shall (together with the Company and the Other Stockholders distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for underwriting by the Company (other than a registration pursuant to Section 4.1(b) and notified by the Company pursuant to Section 4.1(d)(y), in which case Section 4.1(e) shall apply with respect to the selection of underwriters); provided, however, that such underwriting agreement shall not provide for indemnification or contribution obligations on the part of any Holder greater than the obligations of the Holders under Sections 4.7(b) and 4.8. Notwithstanding any other provision of Section 4.1(d), if any registration in respect of which any Holder is exercising its rights under Section 4.1(d) involves an underwritten public offering (other than a registration pursuant to Section 4.1(b), in which case the provisions with respect to priority of inclusion in such registration set forth in Section 4.1(e) shall apply) and the managing underwriter or underwriters advises the Company that in its view marketing factors require a limitation on the number of securities to be underwritten, then there shall be included in such underwritten offering the number or dollar amount of securities of the Company that in the opinion of the managing underwriter or underwriters can be sold without adversely affecting such offering, and such number of securities of the Company shall be allocated for inclusion as follows: (1) first, all securities of the Company being sold by the Company for its own account; (2) second, all Registrable Securities requested to be included by the Holders and, solely with respect to an offering of Warrants following the 180th day after the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization of the Company, securities of the Company being sold by any Person (other than a Holder) with similar piggyback registration rights, pro rata, based on the number of securities beneficially owned by each such Holder and Person; and (3) third, among any other holders of securities of the Company requesting such registration, pro rata, based on the number of securities beneficially owned by each such holder. If any of the Holders or any officer, director or Other Stockholder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, he, she or it may elect to withdraw therefrom by providing written notice to the Company and the underwriter. Any Registrable Securities or other securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration.

^^^^ \centered (ii) against any and all Loss whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided, however, that, with respect to any selling Holder or any underwriter or agent, this indemnity does not apply to any Loss to the extent arising out of an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such selling Holder or underwriter or agent, respectively, expressly for use in the Registration Statement, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus. 

^^^ \centered (b) Each selling Holder agrees severally, and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed a Registration Statement, each underwriter or agent participating in such offering and the other selling Holders, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any such underwriter or agent and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any and all Losses described in the indemnity contained in Section 4.7(a), as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such selling Holder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus.

^^^ \centered (d) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have under this Agreement, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced thereby. If it so elects, after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it, provided that the indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it, the reasonable fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the indemnifying party if there would be a conflict if one counsel were to represent both the indemnified and the indemnifying party, and by the indemnified party in all other circumstances. In no event shall the indemnifying party or parties be liable for a settlement of an action with respect to which they have assumed the defense if such settlement is effected without the written consent of the indemnifying party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), or for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for (i) the Company, its officer, directors and controlling Persons as a group, (ii) the selling Holders and their controlling Persons as a group and (iii) the underwriters or agents and their controlling Persons as a group, in each case, in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. 

^^ \centered 4.8 Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Article 4 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any Loss, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such aggregate Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions (or alleged statements or omissions) which resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue (or alleged untrue) statement of a material fact or the omission (or alleged omission) to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, however, that the obligations of each of the Holders hereunder shall be several and not joint and shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds such Holder receives in such registration and, provided, further, that no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section     

^^ \centered 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 4.8, each Person, if any, who controls an underwriter or agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such underwriter or agent and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed a Registration Statement, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company or a selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or such selling Holder, as the case may be.

^^ \centered 4.10 Lock-Up Agreements. The Company agrees that, if requested by the managing underwriter in any underwritten public offering permitted by this Agreement, it will not, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of any Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock (subject to customary exceptions), other than any such sale or distribution of Common Stock upon exercise of the Company’s Warrants, in the case of an underwritten offering for a period of 60 days from the effective date of the Registration Statement pertaining to such Common Stock; provided, however, that any such lock-up agreement shall not prohibit the Company from directly or indirectly (i) selling, offering to sell, granting any option for the sale of, or otherwise disposing of any Qualifying Employee Stock (or otherwise maintaining its employee benefits plans in the ordinary course of business) or (ii) issuing Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock upon exercise or conversion of any warrant (including any other Warrant), option, right or convertible or exchangeable security issued in connection with the plan of reorganization. The total number of days that any such lock-up agreement may be in effect in any 365-day period shall not exceed 120 days. The lock-up agreements set forth in this Section 4.10 shall be subject to customary exceptions that may be contained in an underwriting agreement if any such registration involves a similar underwritten offering.

With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees, so long as it is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Act, to use its reasonable best efforts to: 

^^^^^ \centered (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144(c)(1) or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the Securities Act, at all times after the effective date of this Agreement; 
^^^^^ 
^^^^^ \centered (b) file with the SEC, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Exchange Act; and

^^^^^ 
^^ \centered 4.12 Obtaining Exchange Listing. The Company will file a listing application for listing on the exchange on which the then outstanding Common Stock is listed with respect to the Underlying Common Stock as soon as practicable after the date hereof. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to list the Warrants, and maintain such listing, on such exchange or, if not possible, another U.S. national securities exchange, in connection with any proposed underwritten distribution of the Warrants that meets the applicable listing criteria. A copy of any opinion of counsel accompanying a listing application by the Company with respect to the Underlying Common Stock or Warrants shall be furnished to the Warrant Agent, together with a letter to the effect that the Warrant Agent may rely on the statements made in such opinion. 

^^ \centered 4.13 The Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent shall have no duties or obligations under this Article 4 and shall have no duty to monitor or enforce the Company’s compliance with this Article 4. 

^ \centered 5. ADJUSTMENTS AND OTHER RIGHTS. 

^^ \centered 5.1 Stock Dividend; Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. If the Company at any time issues to holders of the Common Stock a dividend payable solely in, or other distribution solely of, Common Stock (a “Stock Dividend”), the Exercise Price in effect at the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying such Exercise Price by the quotient of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such record date divided by (y) the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution. If the Company at any time subdivides or combines (by stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization or otherwise) the outstanding Common Stock into a greater or smaller number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the time of effectiveness of such subdivision or combination shall be adjusted at such time of effectiveness to the price determined by multiplying such Exercise Price by the quotient of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such time of effectiveness divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the time of effectiveness of and after giving effect to such subdivision or combination. In any such event referred to in this Section 5.1, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant as in effect immediately prior to the Exercise Price adjustment contemplated by the foregoing shall be adjusted immediately thereafter to the amount determined by multiplying such number by the quotient of (x) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such Exercise Price adjustment divided by (y) the Exercise Price determined in accordance with such Exercise Price adjustment. 

^^ \centered 5.2 Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from time to time prior to the exercise of any Warrant the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a dividend or     

^^ \centered other distribution (other than as contemplated by Section 5.5), other than a Stock Dividend covered by Section 5.1 or a distribution of rights or warrants covered by Section 5.3, to the holders of its Common Stock (collectively, a “Distribution”) of: 

^^^^^^ \centered (A) any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of its capital stock or any other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including cash); or 
^^^^^^ 
^^^^^^ \centered (B) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any of the following: any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of its capital stock or any other securities or property of any nature whatsoever; 
^^^^^^ 
then, in each such case, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on such record date shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying such Exercise Price by the quotient of (x) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading without the right to receive such Distribution, minus the amount of cash and/or the Fair Market Value of the securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants to be so distributed in respect of one share of Common Stock divided by (y) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading without the right to receive such Distribution; such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant as in effect immediately prior to the close of business on such record date shall be increased immediately thereafter to the amount determined by multiplying such number by the quotient of (x) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the adjustment contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence divided by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. If the Distribution includes Common Stock as well as other items of the sort referred to in Section 5.2(A) or (B), then instead of adjusting for the entire Distribution under this Section 5.2 the Common Stock portion shall be treated as a Stock Dividend that triggers an adjustment to the Exercise Price and number of shares of Common Stock obtainable upon exercise of each Warrant under Section 5.1 and the other items in the Distribution shall trigger a further adjustment to such adjusted Exercise Price and number of shares under this Section 5.2. In the event that such Distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the Board determines not to distribute such shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, cash or warrants, as the case may be, to the Exercise Price that would then be in effect and the number of Shares that would then be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant if such record date had not been fixed.

^^ \centered 5.3 Rights Offerings. If at any time the Company shall distribute rights or warrants to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock entitling them, for a period of not more than 45 days, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the date on which the Board declares such distribution of rights or warrants, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such distribution shall be reduced     

^^ \centered immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying such Exercise Price by the quotient of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Fair Market Value divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant as in effect immediately prior to the close of business on such record date shall be increased immediately thereafter to the amount determined by multiplying such number by the quotient of (x) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the adjustment contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence divided by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. In case any rights or warrants referred to in this Section 5.3 in respect of which an adjustment shall have been made shall expire unexercised and any shares that would have been underlying such rights or warrants shall not have been allocated pursuant to any backstop commitment or any similar arrangement, the Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant then in effect shall be readjusted at the time of such expiration to the Exercise Price that would then be in effect and the number of Shares that would then be issuable upon exercise of each Warrant if no adjustment had been made on account of such expired rights or warrants. 

^^ \centered 5.4 Issuer Tender or Exchange Offers. If the Company or any subsidiary of the Company shall consummate a tender or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock for a consideration per share with a Fair Market Value greater than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date such tender or exchange offer is first publicly announced (the “Announcement Date”), the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the expiration date for such tender or exchange offer shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying such Exercise Price by the quotient of (x) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Announcement Date minus the Premium Per Post-Tender Share divided by (y) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Announcement Date. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant as in effect immediately prior to such expiration date shall be increased immediately thereafter to the amount determined by multiplying such number by the quotient of (x) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the adjustment contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence divided by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. As used in this Section 5.4 with respect to any tender or exchange offer, “Premium Per Post-Tender Share” means the quotient of (x) the amount by which the aggregate Fair Market Value of the consideration paid in such tender or exchange offer exceeds the aggregate Fair Market Value on the Announcement Date of the shares of Common Stock purchased therein divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the expiration date for such tender or exchange offer (after giving pro forma effect to the purchase of shares being purchased in the tender or exchange offer). 

^^ \centered 5.5 Reorganization, Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale. Any recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets or other transaction, which in each case is effected in such a way that the shares of Common Stock are converted into the right to receive (either directly or upon     

^^ \centered subsequent liquidation) stock, securities, other equity interests or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock is referred to herein as “Organic Change.” Prior to the consummation of any Organic Change, the Company shall make appropriate provision to ensure that each of the Holders shall thereafter have the right to acquire and receive, in lieu of or in addition to (as the case may be) the Common Stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon the exercise of such Holder’s Warrants, (x) in the case of a Mixed Consideration Merger, the Public Stock issued in such Mixed Consideration Merger and (y) in the case of any other Organic Change, such stock, securities, other equity interests or assets, in each case as may be issued or payable in connection with the Organic Change with respect to or in exchange for the number of shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon exercise of such Holder’s Warrants, for an aggregate Exercise Price per Warrant equal to (i) in the case of a Mixed Consideration Merger, the aggregate Exercise Price per Warrant as in effect immediately prior to such Mixed Consideration Merger times the Stock Consideration Ratio and (ii) in the case of any other Organic Change, the aggregate Exercise Price per Warrant as in effect immediately prior to such Organic Change. In any such case, the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that all of the provisions of the Warrants shall thereafter be applicable to such stock, securities, other equity interests or assets. The Company shall not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets where the Warrants will be assumed by the successor entity, unless prior to the consummation thereof, the successor entity (if other than the Company) resulting from consolidation or merger or the entity purchasing such assets assumes by written instrument the obligation to deliver to each such Holder upon exercise of any Warrant, such stock, securities, equity interests or assets (including cash) as, in accordance with Article 5, such Holder may be entitled to acquire. This Section 5.5 shall not apply to any Warrants or Common Stock redeemed or sold in connection with any Organic Change pursuant to Section 6.1, Section 6.2(b), Section 6.3(a)(i) and Section 6.3(b), provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the adjustments set forth in this Section 5.5 shall be applicable to any Warrants that remain outstanding pursuant to this Agreement in connection with a Public Stock Merger or Mixed Consideration Merger (including any adjustment applicable in connection with such Public Stock Merger or Mixed Consideration Merger). 

^^ \centered 5.6 Other Adjustments. The Board shall make appropriate adjustments to the amount of cash or number of shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, due upon exercise of the Warrants, as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this Article 5 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in its reasonable good faith judgment, in each case to account for any adjustment to the Exercise Price and the number of shares purchasable on exercise of Warrants for the relevant Warrant Certificate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Exercise Price and the number of shares purchasable on exercise of Warrants for the relevant Warrant Certificate where the record date or effective date (in the case of a subdivision or combination of the Common Stock) of the event occurs, during the period beginning on, and including, the Exercise Date and ending on, and including, the related Settlement Date. 

^^ \centered 5.7 Notice of Adjustment. Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant is adjusted, as herein provided, the Company shall cause the Warrant Agent promptly to mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each Holder notice of such adjustment or adjustments and shall deliver to the Warrant Agent a certificate of a     

^^ \centered firm of independent public accountants selected by the Board (who may be the regular accountants employed by the Company) setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement in reasonable detail of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was made. The Warrant Agent shall be fully protected in relying on such certificate, and on any adjustment contained therein, and shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate, and shall be under no duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate, except to exhibit the same from time to time, to any Holder desiring an inspection thereof during reasonable business hours. The Warrant Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holders to determine whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment of the number of shares of Common Stock or other stock or property issuable on exercise of the Warrants, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making such adjustment or the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock or other stock or property which may be issuable on exercise of the Warrants, or to investigate or confirm whether the information contained in the above referenced certificate complies with the terms of this Agreement or any other document. The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to make any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or security instruments or other securities or properties upon the exercise of any Warrant. 

^ \centered 6. CHANGE OF CONTROL. 

^^ \centered 6.1 Redemption in Connection with a Change of Control Event. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event (other than a Public Stock Merger or Mixed Consideration Merger), at the election of each Holder in its sole discretion by written notice to the Company or the successor to the Company on or prior to the Exercise Date, the Company shall pay to such Holder of outstanding Warrants as of the date of such Change of Control Event, an amount in immediately available funds equal to the Cash Redemption Value for such Warrants, not later than the date which is ten (10) Business Days after such Change of Control Event and the Warrants shall thereafter be extinguished. For purposes of this Section 6.1, the Exercise Date shall mean (a) if the Company entered into a definitive agreement with respect to a Change of Control Event and has provided to the Holders notice of the date on which the Change in Control Event will become effective at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the effectiveness of such event, the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to such event and (b) otherwise, the fifth (5th) Business Day following the effectiveness of the Change of Control Event. The “Cash Redemption Value” for any Warrant will equal the fair value of the Warrant as of the date of such Change of Control Event as determined by an Independent Financial Expert, by employing a valuation based on a computation of the option value of each Warrant using the calculation methods and making the assumptions set forth in Exhibit C. The Cash Redemption Value of the Warrants shall be due and payable within ten (10) Business Days after the date of the applicable Change of Control Event. If a Holder of Warrants does not elect to receive the Cash Redemption Value for such Holder’s Warrants as provided by this Section 6.1, such Warrants will remain outstanding as adjusted pursuant to the provisions of Article 5 hereof. 

^^ \centered 6.2 Public Stock Merger. (a) In connection with a Public Stock Merger, the Company may by written notice to the Holders not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the

^^^ \centered (b) In the case of any Public Stock Merger with respect to which the Company does not make a timely election as contemplated by Section 6.2(a) above, the Company shall pay within five (5) Business Days after the effective date of such Public Stock Merger, to the Warrant Agent on behalf of each Holder of outstanding Warrants as of the effective date of such Public Stock Merger, an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the Cash Redemption Value for such Warrants determined in accordance with Section 6.1 and the Warrants shall be terminated and extinguished. 

^^ \centered 6.3 Mixed Consideration Merger. (a) In connection with a Mixed Consideration Merger, the Company may by written notice to the Holders not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the effective date of such Mixed Consideration Merger elect the following treatment with respect to each outstanding Warrant: (i) pay to the Holder of such Warrant as of the date of such Mixed Consideration Merger the product of the Cash Consideration Ratio multiplied by the Cash Redemption Value for such Warrant, which amount shall be paid in immediately available funds, not later than the date which is ten (10) Business Days after such Mixed Consideration Merger and (ii) the Warrant shall remain outstanding after the Mixed Consideration Merger, as further adjusted pursuant to Section 5.5 and the other provisions of Article 5. The portion of the Cash Redemption Value of the Warrants payable pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 6.3(a) shall be due and payable not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after the date of the Mixed Consideration Merger. 

^^^ \centered (b) In the case of any Mixed Consideration Merger with respect to which the Company does not make a timely election as contemplated by Section 6.3(a) above, the Company shall pay, within ten (10) Business Days after the effective date of such Mixed Consideration Merger, to the Warrant Agent on behalf of each Holder of outstanding Warrants as of the effective date of such Mixed Consideration Merger, an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the Cash Redemption Value for such Warrants determined in accordance with Section 6.1 and the Warrants shall be terminated and extinguished.

The Warrant Certificates shall be issued in registered form only. The Company shall cause to be kept at the office of the Warrant Agent designated for such purpose a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Warrant Certificates and of transfers or exchanges of Warrant Certificates as herein provided (the “Warrant Register”).

At the option of the Holder, Warrant Certificates may be exchanged at such office, and upon payment of the charges hereinafter provided. Whenever any Warrant Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Warrant Agent shall countersign, by manual or facsimile signature, and deliver, the Warrant Certificates that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

All Warrant Certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Warrant Certificates shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same obligations, and entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement, as the Warrant Certificates surrendered for such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Warrant Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Warrant Agent) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B or otherwise satisfactory to the Warrant Agent, properly completed and duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. Until a Warrant Certificate is transferred in the Warrant Register, the Company and the Warrant Agent may treat the person in whose name the Warrant Certificate is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Warrants represented thereby for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. Neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent will be liable or responsible for any registration or transfer of any Warrants that are registered or to be registered in the name of a fiduciary or the nominee of a fiduciary.

No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Warrant Certificates.

The Warrant Agent shall not be liable except for the failure to perform such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Warrant Agent, whose duties and obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Warrant Agent’s aggregate liability under this Agreement with respect to, arising from, or arising in connection with this Agreement, or from all services provided or omitted to be provided under this Agreement, whether in contract, or in tort, or otherwise, is limited to, and shall not exceed, the amounts paid hereunder by the Company to Warrant Agent as fees and charges, but not including reimbursable expenses.

The Warrant Agent may consult with counsel satisfactory to it (which may be counsel to the Company).

Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Warrant Agent deems it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by any authorized officer of the Company and delivered to the Warrant Agent; and such certificate will be full authorization to the Warrant Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. The Warrant Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any one of the authorized officers of the Company, and to apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and it will not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such officer.

In the event the Warrant Agent believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists hereunder or in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by the Warrant Agent hereunder, the Warrant Agent, may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action, and shall be fully protected and shall not be liable in any way to the Company or any Holder or other person or entity for refraining from taking such action, unless the Warrant Agent receives written instructions signed by the Company which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Warrant Agent.

Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company shall give notice thereof to the resigning or removed Warrant Agent.

^ \centered 11. COVENANTS. 

^^ \centered 11.1 Reservation of Common Stock for Issuance on Exercise of Warrants.

The Company shall pay all transfer, stamp and other similar taxes that may be imposed in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Warrants or in respect of the issuance or delivery by the Company of any securities upon exercise of the Warrants with respect thereto.

The Company and each Initial Investor agree that neither the issuance nor exercise of the Warrants is governed by Section 83(a) of the Code or otherwise a compensatory transaction, and the Company agrees that it will not deduct any amount as compensation in connection with such issuance or exercise for federal income tax purpose. The Company and each Initial Investor agree that for federal income tax purposes, the Warrants have been granted as an option premium in exchange for each Initial Investor agreeing, at the option of the Company, to make the equity investment described in the Investment Agreement or Stock Purchase Agreements, as applicable. 

^^ \centered 12.3 Surrender of Certificates. Any Warrant Certificate surrendered for exercise or purchase shall, if surrendered to the Company, be delivered to the Warrant Agent, and all Warrant Certificates surrendered or so delivered to the Warrant Agent shall be promptly cancelled by the Warrant Agent and shall not be reissued by the Company. The Warrant Agent shall destroy such cancelled Warrant Certificates. 

^^ \centered 12.4 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Warrant Certificates. If (a) any mutilated Warrant Certificate is surrendered to the Warrant Agent or (b) the Company and the Warrant Agent receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Warrant Certificate, and there is delivered to the Company and the Warrant Agent such appropriate affidavit of loss, applicable processing fee and a corporate bond of indemnity as may be required by them and satisfactory to them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Warrant Agent that such Warrant Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Warrant Agent shall countersign and deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated Warrant Certificate or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Warrant Certificate, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and for a like aggregate number of Warrants. 

Upon the issuance of any new Warrant Certificate under this Section 12.4, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and other expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Warrant Agent and of counsel to the Company) in connection therewith.

Every new Warrant Certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this Section 12.4 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Warrant Certificate shall constitute an original contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Warrant Certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Warrant Certificates properly completed and duly executed and delivered hereunder.

The provisions of this Section 12.4 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights or remedies with respect to the replacement of mutilated, destroyed lost or stolen Warrant Certificates.

^^ \centered 12.5 Removal of Legends. Certificates evidencing the Warrants and shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Warrants shall not be required to contain any legend referenced in Sections 2.1, 3.6(e) and 3.6(f) (A) while a registration statement (solely for the purposes of this and the immediately following paragraph, such term to include a Registration Statement) covering the resale of the Warrants or the shares of Common Stock is effective under the Securities Act, or (B) following any sale of any such Warrants or shares of Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144, or (C) following receipt of a legal opinion of counsel to Holder that the remaining Warrants or shares of Common Stock held by Holder are eligible for resale without volume limitations or other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, the Company and the Warrant Agent will agree to the removal of all legends with respect to Warrants or shares of Common Stock deposited with DTC from time to time in anticipation of sale in accordance with the volume limitations and other limitations under Rule 144, subject to the Company’s approval of appropriate procedures, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

Following the time at which any such legend is no longer required (as provided above) for certain Warrants or shares of Common Stock, the Company shall promptly, following the delivery by Holder to the Warrant Agent of a legended certificate representing such Warrants or shares of Common Stock, as applicable, deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder a certificate representing such Warrants or shares of Common Stock that is free from such legend. In the event any of the legends referenced in Sections 2.1, 3.6(e) and or 3.6(f) are removed from any of the Warrants or shares of Common Stock, and thereafter the effectiveness of a registration statement covering such Warrants or shares of Common Stock is suspended or the Company determines that a supplement or amendment thereto is required by applicable securities Laws, then the Company may require that such legends, as applicable, be placed on any such applicable Warrants or shares of Common Stock that cannot then be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or under Rule 144 and Holder shall cooperate in the replacement of such legend. Such legend shall thereafter be removed when such Warrants or shares of Common Stock may again be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or under Rule 144.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a failure by any Purchaser to pay all amounts payable by such Purchaser under Article I and Article II of the Investment Agreement or a Stock Purchase Agreements, as applicable, causes the termination of the Investment Agreement or a Stock Purchase Agreement, as applicable, by the Company pursuant to Section 11.1(c)(iii) therein, each Holder that is a member of the Purchaser Group of such Purchaser agrees that as liquidated damages for such failure and without prejudice to the rights and remedies of the Company under the Investment Agreement or Stock Purchase Agreements, as applicable, any Warrants held by such Holder shall be deemed cancelled, null and void and of no further effect.

All shares of Common Stock issuable by the Company upon the exercise of Warrants shall, upon such issue, be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable.

In order to exercise a Warrant, the registered holder hereof must surrender this Warrant Certificate at the corporate trust office of the Warrant Agent, with the Exercise Subscription Form on the reverse hereof duly executed by the Holder hereof, with signature guaranteed as therein specified, together with any required payment in full of the Exercise Price (unless the Holder shall have elected Net Share Settlement, as such term is defined in the Warrant Agreement) then in effect for the share(s) of Underlying Common Stock as to which the Warrant(s) represented by this Warrant Certificate are submitted for exercise, all subject to the terms and conditions hereof and of the Warrant Agreement.

\centered **EXHIBIT C**

\centered **Option Pricing Assumptions / Methodology**

For the purpose of this Exhibit C:

“*Acquiror*” means (A) the third party that has entered into definitive document for a transaction, or (B) the offeror in the event of a tender or exchange offer.

“*Reference Date*” means the date of consummation of a Change of Control Event.

The Cash Redemption Value of the Warrants shall be determined using the Black-Scholes Model as applied to third party options (*i.e.*, options issued by a third party that is not affiliated with the issuer of the underlying stock). For purposes of the model, the following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below:

**Underlying Security Price:**   · In the event of a merger or other acquisition,  (A) that is an “all cash” deal, the cash per share of Common Stock to be paid to the Company’s stockholders in the transaction;  (B) that is an “all Public Stock” deal,  (1) that is a “fixed exchange ratio” transaction, a “fixed value” transaction where as a result of a cap, floor, collar or similar mechanism the number of Acquiror’s shares to be paid per share of Common Stock to the Company’s stockholders in the transaction is greater or less than it would otherwise have been or a transaction that is not otherwise described in this clause (B)(1) or clause (B)(2) below, the product of (i) the Fair Market Value of the Acquiror’s common stock on the day preceding the date of the Preliminary Change of Control Event and (ii) the number of Acquiror’s shares per share of Common Stock to be paid to the Company’s stockholders in the transaction (provided that the Independent Financial Expert shall make appropriate adjustments to the Fair Market Value of the Acquiror’s common stock referred to above as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this Exhibit C and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in its reasonable good faith judgment, in each case to account for any event impacting the Acquiror’s common stock that is analogous to any of the events described in Article V of this Agreement if the record date, ex date or effective date of that event occurs during or after the 10 trading

day period over which such Fair Market Value is measured) and  (2) that is a “fixed value” transaction not covered by clause (B)(1) above, the value per share of Common Stock to be paid to the Company’s stockholders in the transaction;  (C) that is a transaction contemplating various forms of consideration for each share of Common Stock,  (1) the cash portion, if any, shall be valued as described in clause (A) above,  (2) the Public Stock portion shall be valued as described in clause (B) above and  (3) any other forms of consideration shall be valued by the Independent Financial Expert valuing the Warrants, using one or more valuation methods that the Independent Financial Expert in its best professional judgment determines to be most appropriate, assuming such consideration (if securities) is fully distributed and is to be sold in an arm’s-length transaction and there was no compulsion on the part of any party to such sale to buy or sell and taking into account all relevant factors and without applying any discounts to such consideration.

· In the event of all other Change of Control Event events, the Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the date of the Change of Control Event.

**Exercise Price:**   The Exercise Price as adjusted and then in effect for the Warrant.

**Dividend Rate:**   0 (which reflects the fact that the antidilution adjustment provisions cover all dividends).

**Interest Rate:**   The annual yield as of the Reference Date (expressed on a semi-annual basis in the manner in which U.S. treasury notes are ordinarily quoted) of the U.S. treasury note maturing approximately at the Expiration Date as selected by the Independent Financial Expert.

**Put or Call:**   Call

**Time to Expiration**   The number of days from the Expiration Date (as defined in Section 3.3) to the Reference Date divided by 365.

**Settlement Date:**   The scheduled date of payment of the Cash Redemption Value.

**Volatility:**   For calculation of Cash Redemption Value in connection with a Change of Control Event with respect to (A) the Warrants or the New Warrants, [[Percentage 3: Number]]% or (B) the GGO Warrants, the lesser of (1) [[Percentage 4: Number]]% or (2) the volatility of General Growth Opportunities, Inc. as determined by an Independent Financial Expert engaged to make the calculation, who shall be instructed to assume for purposes of the determination of volatility referred to in this clause (B)(2) that the Change of Control Event had not occurred; provided, however, that if the Warrants, New Warrants or GGO Warrants are adjusted as a result of a Change of Control Event, volatility for purposes of calculating Cash Redemption Value in connection with succeeding Change of Control Events with respect to such warrants (or their successors) shall be as determined by an Independent Financial Expert engaged to make the calculation, who shall be instructed to assume for purposes of the calculation that such succeeding Change of Control Event had not occurred.

Such valuation of the Warrant shall not be discounted in any way.

For illustrative purposes only, an example Black-Scholes model calculation with respect to a hypothetical warrant appears on the following page.

**Illustrative Example**

Inputs:

^= Underlying Security Price

^= Exercise Price

**PV(X)** = Present value of the Exercise Price, discounted at a rate of R = X * (e^-(R * T))

^= Volatility

^= continuously compounded risk free rate = 2 * [ ln (1 + Interest Rate / 2) ]

^= Time to Expiration

^= warrant value per underlying share

^= number of shares underlying warrants

**Value** = total warrant value

Formulaic inputs:

**D1** = [ ln [ S / X ] + (R + (V^2 / 2)) * T)] ÷ (V * √T)

**D2** = [ ln [ S / X ] + (R - (V^2 / 2)) * T)] ÷ (V * √T)

**Black-Scholes Formula**

^= [N(D1) * S]  [N(D2) * PV(X)]

Where “N” is the cumulative normal probability function

**Value** = W * Z

**Example of a Hypothetical Warrant****:(4)**

^Note: Amounts calculated herein may not foot due to rounding error. For precise calculations, decimal points should not be rounded.

Inputs:

Interest Rate = [[Percentage 5: Number]]%

^= $50.00

^= $60.00

**PV(X)** = $55.43

^= [[Percentage 6: Number]]%

^= [[Percentage 7: Number]]%

^= 2

^= 100

Formulaic inputs:

**D1** = [ ln [ S / X ] + (R + (V^2 / 2)) * T)] ÷ (V * √T)

= (-0.1149)

**D2** = [ ln [ S / X ] + (R - (V^2 / 2)) * T)] ÷ (V * √T)

= (-0.4684)

***Black-Scholes Formula***

^**=** [N(D1) * S]  [N(D2) * PV(E)]

= $[[USD Value 7: Number]]

***Total Warrant Value***

**Value****=** W * Z

**=** $[[USD Value 5: Number]]
