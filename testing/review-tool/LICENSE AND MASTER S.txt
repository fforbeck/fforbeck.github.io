Customer agrees that its execution of this License constitutes a firm offer to enter into this License which may not be withdrawn for a 

period of thirty (30) days after delivery to Licensor (or such other period as may be expressly provided in any other agreement signed by the parties). During such period and in reliance on the foregoing, Licensor may, at Licensor's option (and shall if required by applicable Law), deposit any security deposit and License Fees or other payment, proceed with any plans, specifications, alterations or improvements and permit Customer to enter the Customer Area, but such acts shall not be deemed an acceptance of Customer's offer to enter this License and such acceptance shall be evidenced only by Licensor signing and delivering this License to Customer.

*Note 1: Air Temperature will be monitored at the midpoint of both the x and y axis of each designated cold aisle in the Customer Area and immediately below the drop ceiling in the Customer Area, or as otherwise reasonably determined by Licensor.*

*Note 2: Humidity will be measured by the humidification control system that pertains to the Customer Area, or as otherwise reasonably determined by Licensor.*

*Note 3: As relates to IP Bandwidth, Customer recognizes that the internet is comprised of thousands of autonomous systems and that this SLA covers the provision of access by Licensor to the global internet “cloud”. Routing anomalies, asymmetries, inconsistencies and failures, outside of the control of Licensor, can and will occur on other networks. In such instance, Licensor sh all use its commercially reasonable efforts to route traffic via an alternative route path, but any such events shall not be deemed to be a Service Level Failure for purposes hereof.

An applicable Service Level Credit allowance shall appear on Customer’s next invoice following processing. Service Level Credits shall not have any cash value at the end of the Term or otherwise. Service Level Credits shall be calculated as a rebate of monthly License Fees, as applied specifically to the particular Data Center service that experienced the Service Level Failure. If the price of the particular Data Center Service which was impacted by a Service Level Failure is not specified in the Customer’s Agreement (e.g., due to package pricing), the price will be determined by Licensor using Licensor’s then current market pricing for the specific Data Center service. 

One or more concurrent Service Level Failures shall yield the specific Service Level Credit that is most favorable to Customer.

No Service Level Credits will be given for a service interruption: (a) caused by the action or failure to act by a Customer Party; (b) due to failure of equipment provided by a Customer Party; (c) during any period in which Licensor is not given access to the service premises; (d) which is part of a planned service interruption for maintenance in accordance with Attachment B, or results from implementation of a Customer order; (e) due to a force majeure event; (f) for which Customer is entitled to a Service Level Credit for the same or a contemporaneous Service Level Failure; (g) affecting portions of the Customer Area used for office or storage space; or (h) resulting from Customer’s breach of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Attachment C).

Total cumulative Service Level Credits earned in any thirty (30) day period shall not exceed the amount of one (1) month’s License Fees for the Customer Area.

This Service Level Agreement m ay be modified from time to time by Licensor and can be reviewed by Customer at the Data Center, provided that Customer may request that the terms of the particular Service Level Agreement that were in effect as of the Effective Date remain applicable during the Term.

\centered **IP JUSTIFICATION FORM** 

**Dear Valued Customer,**

Thank you for using LYFE Communications, Inc.! Please use this form to request and justify IP space from SYPHERANCE. The information on this form is required prior to installation and activation of your order to assure on-time activation of your service.

SYPHERANCE applies specific criteria in evaluating address space requests from our customers in order to make efficient use of IP space as required by ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers) guidelines and RFC 2050. ARIN requires documentation, including justification, of IP address assignments that Internet Service Providers (including LYFE Communications, Inc.) make to their customers. 

Please fill out the form as completely and in as much detail as possible. Requests that are not accompanied by sufficient detail to prove efficient usage will be rejected and this may delay the installation of your SYPHERANCE IP service.

SYPHERANCE uses the following general guidelines to assign IP addresses:

For initial assignments to new customers, [[Percentage 4]]% of the assignment must be in immediate use (i.e. within the first 30 days).

For subsequent assignmen ts, [[Percentage 9: Number]]% of all previous assignments must be in use, and [[Percentage 4]]% of the new assignment must be in immediate use (i.e. within the first 30 days).

If you’re switching to SYPHERANCE from another ISP, and are returning your current IP addresses to your old ISP and only use IP addresses from SYPHERANCE, SYPHERANCE requires that [[Percentage 4]]% of newly assigned IP addresses will be in immediate use (i.e. within the first 30 days).

If you have IP addresses from other ISPs that you’ll be using along with SYPHERANCE IP addresses, SYPHERANCE will need to review utilization of the address space from t he other ISP ensuring those addresses are [[Percentage 9]]% utilized before assigning you additional IP addresses.

SYPHERANCE IP addresses are **non-portable**. This means that the addresses you receive from SYPHERANCE cannot be used with another provider and must be returned if you discontinue service with SYPHERANCE.

In order for SYPHERANCE to assign IP addresses to your organization, you must complete the attached form and return it to your SYPHERANCE Sales executive for processing. If the requested IP addresses are not approved, you will receive information regarding this decision along with how much space SYPHERANCE can allocate based upon the information submitted. We are very sorry for any inconvenience or delay that this may cause you, and hope that you will understand the necessity of complying with ARIN’s requirements.

**Section II: New IP Address Assignment Information**

In the tables below, detail, on a per-subnet basis, your requirements for IP Addresses. Use as much space as required (including additional pages, if necessary). Be sure to list:

Internal requirements for IP addresses listing each separate subnet or networ k

**Description of Network/Subnet**   **Total # IP’s in this Subnet**   **# Hosts in this subnet initially**   **# Hosts in this subnet in 3 months**

**Section III: Previous IP Usage**

Customers must make efficient usage of [[Percentage 9]]% of all the space previously assigned to them by SYPHERANCE before being assigned additional space. If your organization has not previously received IP space from SYPHERANCE, please check the following box and skip to the next section. Please note that failing to reveal previously assigned space may result in a rejected request. 

Please list the all IPs previously assigned by SYPHERANCE:

If you will be renumbering and returning all previously assigned IP address space, please check here and skip to the next section. ___

In the space below, please provide a detailed description of how the IPs are used. The first column should be a list of the specific IPs, range of IPs, or subnets that you are using. See the previous section for the second column. The third column should contain the number of active hosts in that network. The fourth column should contain a detailed description of what is on the IPs or network, including who uses the network and what services might be running there. SYPHERANCE reserves the right to run ping scans and port mappers to verify the actual usage.

*KEY:

OI = addresses will be used by your organization for internal purposes, such as employee workstations 

OE = addresses will be used by your organization for external purposes, such as your own corporate web servers 

CS = addresses will be used on machines run by your organization for customer purposes web/application hosting 

CC = addresses will be used by customers of your organization for machines that they have colocated at your facility 

CNS = addresses will be reassigned or reallocated statically to customers of your organization 

CND = addresses will be assigned dynamically to customers of your organization: dialup pools or cable modems 

^= any other addresses 

For organizations that have previously been assigned a /23 or larger, if you have reassigned or reallocated space to your customers, please provide reassignment information as specified by RFC 2050. This is required by SYPHERANCE to process your request. You may choose to do so by submitting SWIP requests, putting the data in an RWHOIS you maintain, or attaching a simple table of IPs and customers on a separate sheet.

___ I'm using SWIP. Please specify OrgID or POC under which the blocks were submitted:

___ I'm using RWHOIS. Please specify hostname and port of the RWHOIS server:

**Section IV: Restrictions**

Please note that all IPs assigned by SYPHERANCE Communication are non-portable. This means that you may not use the space with another provider (except for those running BGP who wish to multi-home the block with another ISP and have received permission from our BGP team), and, if you cancel service with SYPHERANCE, the IP space must be returned (even if prior permission was given to multi-home the space). 

Also, while SYPHERANCE respects your privacy and will strive to keep the information provided on this form as confidential as possible, please be aware that we may be required to share the information provided on this form with ARIN. As noted in section 2, SYPHERANCE is required to maintain customer reassignment and reallocation information in a publicly accessible database. Contact information furnished in section 2 will be registered in our RWHOIS server or the SWIP database based on each customer's expressed preference. 

Furthermore, note that your usage of the IP space must comply with ARIN gui delines. This includes using efficient subnet sizes and dynamic addresses as much as possible. Administrative ease is not an excuse for using inefficiently-sized subnets. 

Finally, by submitting the request, you agree to give permission to SYPHERANCE to use ping tests and port scans to verify your usage. 

^have read and understood the restrictions listed above, and I agree to comply with and adhere to the IP usage guidelines of both ARIN and LYFE Communications, Inc.. I certify that the information I provided in the form is correct, and I give SYPHERANCE permission to verify the information. I realize that failure to provide complete and accurate information may result in a rejected request. I also give permission for SYPHERANCE to share the above information with ARIN.
