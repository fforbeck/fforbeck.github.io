\centered A G R E E M E N T 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and in order to induce Lender to make the Loan to Borrower, Affiliated Guarantor hereby agrees, in favor of Lender, as follows: 

^Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed in the Mortgage. 

^Guaranteed Obligations. 

^^Affiliated Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Lender, until final and indefeasible payment thereof has been made, payment of the Guaranteed Obligations (as hereinafter defined in 2(b) below), in each case when and as the same shall become due and payable, it being the intent of Affiliated Guarantor that the guaranty set forth herein shall be a guaranty of payment and not a guaranty of collection. 

^^As used in this Agreement, “Guaranteed Obligations” means any and all obligations, indebtedness, or liabilities of any kind or character owed by Borrower to Lender under the Note, the Mortgage, and the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the unpaid principal sum evidenced by the Note, all accrued and unpaid interest, late charges, default interest, prepayment fees and any and all other sums evidenced by this Note or secured by the Mortgage and/or any other Loan Documents as well as any future advances under the Mortgage that may be made to or on behalf of Borrower by Lender following the Execution Date and including interest accruing following the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against the Borrower, at the rate specified in the Note, whether or not such interest is allowed as a claim in bankruptcy plus all costs, including, without limitation, all attorney’s fees and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with collection of the Guaranteed Obligations. 

^^This Agreement and the obligation of Affiliated Guarantor to pay the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by the Affiliated Subordinate Deed of Trust. 

^Release of Affiliated Guaranty and Affiliated Subordinate Deed of Trust. 

^^The obligations of Affiliated Guarantor under this Agreement shall terminate and the Affiliated Subordinate Deed of Trust shall be released and reconveyed (“Affiliated Guaranty Termination”) upon the first to occur of: 

^^^The full payment and satisfaction of all obligations under the Loan Documents and under the loan documents for the Affiliated Loan in accordance with their respective terms. 

^^^The exercise of the transfer right pursuant to and in accordance with Section 10.3 of the Affiliated Deed of Trust. 

^^^The exercise of the release right pursuant to and in accordance with Section 10.9 of the Affiliated Deed of Trust. 

^^Affiliated Guarantor shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with the Affiliated Guaranty Termination and the release of the Affiliated Subordinate Deed of Trust, including without limitation, documentation costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees. 

^Primary Obligations. This Agreement is a primary and original obligation of Affiliated Guarantor, is not merely the creation of a surety relationship, and is an absolute and unconditional guaranty of payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations which shall remain in full force and effect without respect to future changes in conditions, including any change of law or any invalidity or irregularity with respect to the issuance of the Loan Documents. Affiliated Guarantor agrees that it is directly, jointly and severally with any and all other guarantors of the Guaranteed Obligations, liable to Lender, that the obligations of Affiliated Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of Borrower or any other guarantor, and that a separate action may be brought against each person signing as Affiliated Guarantor whether such action is brought against Borrower or any other guarantor or whether Borrower or any such other guarantor is joined in such action. Affiliated Guarantor agrees that its liability hereunder shall be immediate and shall not be contingent upon the exercise or enforcement by Lender of whatever remedies it may have against Borrower or any other guarantor, or the enforcement of any lien or realization upon any security Lender may at any time possess. 

Affiliated Guarantor agrees that any release which may be given by Lender to Borrower or any other guarantor shall not release Affiliated Guarantor. Affiliated Guarantor consents and agrees that Lender shall be under no obligation to marshal any assets of Borrower or any other guarantor in favor of Affiliated Guarantor, or against or in payment of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations. 

^Releases. Affiliated Guarantor consents and agrees that, without notice to Affiliated Guarantor and without affecting or impairing the obligations of Affiliated Guarantor hereunder, Lender may, by action or inaction: 

^^compromise, settle, extend the duration or the time for the payment of, or discharge the performance of, or may refuse to or otherwise not enforce this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, or any part thereof, with respect to Borrower or any other person or entity; 

^^release Borrower or any other person or entity or grant other indulgences to Borrower or any other person or entity in respect thereof; 

^^amend or modify in any manner and at any time (or from time to time) any of the Loan Documents; or 

^^release or substitute any other guarantor, if any, of the Guaranteed Obligations, or enforce, exchange, release, or waive any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any portion thereof. 

^No Election. Lender shall have all of the rights to seek recourse against Affiliated Guarantor to the fullest extent provided for herein, and no election by Lender to proceed in one form of action or proceeding, or against any party, or on any obligation, shall constitute a waiver of Lender’s right to proceed in any other form of action or proceeding or against other parties unless Lender has expressly waived such right in writing. Specifically, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no action or proceeding by Lender under any document or instrument evidencing the Guaranteed Obligations shall serve to diminish the liability of Affiliated Guarantor under this Affiliated Guaranty except to the extent that Lender finally and unconditionally shall have realized indefeasible payment by such action or proceeding. 

^Indefeasible Payment. The Guaranteed Obligations shall not be considered indefeasibly paid for purposes of this Affiliated Guaranty unless and until all payments to Lender are no longer subject to any right on the part of any person, including Borrower, Borrower as a debtor in possession, or any trustee (whether appointed under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (11 U.S.C.), as amended or supplemented from time to time, and any successor statute, and any and all rules issued or promulgated in connection therewith (the “Bankruptcy Code”) or otherwise of any of Borrower’s assets to invalidate or set aside such payments or to seek to recoup the amount of such payments or any portion thereof, or to declare same to be fraudulent or preferential. In the event that, for any reason, any portion of such payments to Lender is set aside or restored, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, after the making thereof, then the obligation intended to be satisfied thereby shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment or payments had not been made, and Affiliated Guarantor shall be liable for the full amount Lender is required to repay plus any and all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses and attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred pursuant to proceedings arising under the Bankruptcy Code) paid by Lender in connection therewith. 

^Representations and Warranties. Affiliated Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Lender that: 

^^Affiliated Guarantor has the corporate power and authority and the legal right to execute and deliver and to perform its under this Agreement; 

^^The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Affiliated Guarantor will not violate any provision of any requirement of law binding on Affiliated Guarantor, organizational document or contractual obligation of the Affiliated Guarantor in any respect and will not result in or require the creation or imposition of any lien or encumbrance upon any of its properties or revenues of the Affiliated Guarantor pursuant to any such requirement of law, organizational document or contractual obligation, in any such case, which violation, lien or encumbrance will have a materially adverse affect on the ability of Affiliated Guarantor to perform under this Agreement; 

^^This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Affiliated Guarantor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Affiliated Guarantor, enforceable against the Affiliated Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity (including concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing), regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;

^^To Affiliated Guarantor’s knowledge, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best knowledge of the Affiliated Guarantor, threatened against or affecting the Affiliated Guarantor or any property of the Affiliated Guarantor before any court, or governmental authority, which, if determined adversely to the Affiliated Guarantor, would have a material adverse affect on its financial position;

Affiliated Guarantor further represents and warrants to Lender that Affiliated Guarantor has read and understands the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents. Affiliated Guarantor hereby covenants that Affiliated Guarantor will continue to keep informed of Borrower’s financial condition, the financial condition of other guarantors, if any, and of all other circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the Guaranteed Obligations.

^Subordination. Affiliated Guarantor hereby agrees that any and all present and future indebtedness of Borrower owing to Affiliated Guarantor is postponed in favor of and subordinated to payment, in full, in cash, of the Guaranteed Obligations. In this regard, no payment of any kind whatsoever shall be made with respect to such indebtedness if and so long as any Guaranteed Obligations are due and have not been indefeasibly paid in full. Until payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, Affiliated Guarantor agrees not to accept any payment or satisfaction of any kind of indebtedness of Borrower to Affiliated Guarantor and hereby assigns such indebtedness to Lender, including the right to file proof of claim and to vote thereon in connection with any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, including the right to vote on any plan of reorganization.

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, Beneficiary agrees that its sole recourse against the Operating Lessee for the Operating Lessee’s obligations hereunder or under the other Security Documents shall be to the collateral owned by the Operating Lessee and pledged to Beneficiary pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents; provided however, the foregoing shall not limit Beneficiary’s rights against Affiliated Guarantor and/or Fairmont Liable Party with respect to the obligations of Operating Lessee to the extent otherwise permitted under the Security Documents.

^^To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Affiliated Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally, irrevocably, knowingly, and expressly waives (A) any rights to assert against Lender any defense (legal or equitable), set-off, counterclaim, or claim which Affiliated Guarantor may now or at any time hereafter have against Borrower or any other party liable to Lender; (B) any defense, set-off, counterclaim, or claim, of any kind or nature, arising directly or indirectly from the present or future lack of perfection, sufficiency, validity, or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor; (C) any defense Affiliated Guarantor has to performance hereunder, and any right Affiliated Guarantor has to be exonerated, arising by reason of: the impairment or suspension of Lender’s rights or remedies against Borrower; the alteration by Lender of the Guaranteed Obligations; any discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations by operation of law as a result of Lender’s intervention or omission; or the acceptance by Lender of anything in partial satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations; (D) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting Affiliated Guarantor’s liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof, and any act which shall defer or delay the operation of any statute of limitations applicable to the Guaranteed Obligations shall similarly operate to defer or delay the operation of such statute of limitations applicable to Affiliated Guarantor’s liability hereunder. 

^^Affiliated Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally, irrevocably, knowingly, and expressly waives any defense Affiliated Guarantor may have because Borrower’s debt is secured by real property, including any such defenses arising by reason of or deriving from (i) any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by Lender; or (ii) any election by Lender under Bankruptcy Code Section 1111(b) to limit the amount of, or any collateral securing, its claim against Borrower. 

^^To the extent applicable under the laws of the State of Illinois and if, for any reason, Section 15 is not applied to this Agreement and the laws of the State of California are deemed to apply to this Agreement, then and in such event, in addition to the foregoing waivers, Affiliated Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally, knowingly, and expressly waives: 

^^^Affiliated Guarantor’s right by statute (including, without limitation, its rights under California Civil Code Sections 2845 or 2850) or otherwise to require Lender to institute suit against Borrower or to exhaust any rights and remedies which Lender has or may have against Borrower or any collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations provided by Borrower, Affiliated Guarantor or any third party. In this regard, Affiliated Guarantor agrees that it is bound to the payment of all Guaranteed Obligations, whether now existing or hereafter accruing, as fully as if such Guaranteed Obligations were directly owing to Lender by Affiliated Guarantor. 

^^^(A) Any defense Affiliated Guarantor has to performance hereunder, and any right Affiliated Guarantor has to be exonerated, provided by California Civil Code 

Sections 2819, 2822, or 2825, or otherwise, arising by reason of: the impairment or suspension of Lender’s rights or remedies against Borrower; the alteration by Lender of the Guaranteed Obligations; any discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations by operation of law as a result of Lender’s intervention or omission; or the acceptance by Lender of anything in partial satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations. 

^^^Any defense Affiliated Guarantor may have because Borrower’s debt is secured by real property, including any such defenses arising by reason of or deriving from any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by Lender including any defense based any claim or defense based upon (i) an election of remedies by Lender under the provisions of the California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580a, 580b, 580d, and 726 or any similar law of California or any other jurisdiction; or (ii) any election by Lender under Bankruptcy Code Section 1111(b) to limit the amount of, or any collateral securing, its claim against Borrower 

^^^Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 2856: 

^Affiliated Guarantor waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the creditor, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed Affiliated Guarantor’s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against Borrower by the operation of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 580(d) or otherwise. 

^Affiliated Guarantor waives all rights and defenses that Affiliated Guarantor may have because some of the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by real property. This means, among other things: 

^^Lender may collect from Affiliated Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by Borrower for the Guaranteed Obligations; and 

^^If Lender forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by Borrower for the Guaranteed Obligations: (A) the amount of the debt may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price; and (B) Lender may collect from Affiliated Guarantor even if Lender, by foreclosing on the real property collateral pledged by Borrower for the Guaranteed Obligations, has destroyed any right Affiliated Guarantor may have to collect from Borrower. This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Affiliated Guarantor may have because Borrower’s debt is secured by real property. These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580 (a), 580(b), 580(d) or 726. 

^^^If any of the Guaranteed Obligations at any time are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust upon real property, Lender may elect, in its sole discretion, upon a default with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, to foreclose such mortgage or deed of trust judicially or nonjudicially in any manner permitted by law, before or after enforcing the Loan Documents, without diminishing or affecting the liability of Affiliated Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations are repaid with the proceeds of such foreclosure. Affiliated Guarantor understands that (a) by virtue of the operation of California’s antideficiency law applicable to nonjudicial foreclosures, an election by Lender nonjudicially to foreclose such a mortgage or deed of trust probably would have the effect of impairing or destroying rights of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution, or indemnity of Affiliated Guarantor against Borrower or other Affiliated Guarantors or sureties, and (b) absent the waiver given by Affiliated Guarantor, such an election would prevent Lender from enforcing the Loan Documents against Affiliated Guarantor. Understanding the foregoing, and understanding that Affiliated Guarantor is hereby relinquishing a defense to the enforceability of the Loan Documents, Affiliated Guarantor hereby waives any right to assert against Lender any defense to the enforcement of the Loan Documents, whether denominated “estoppel” or otherwise, based on or arising from an election by Lender nonjudicially to foreclose any such mortgage or deed of trust. Affiliated Guarantor understands that the effect of the foregoing waiver may be that Affiliated Guarantor may have liability hereunder for amounts with respect to which Affiliated Guarantor may be left without rights of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution, or indemnity against Borrower or other Affiliated Guarantors or sureties. Affiliated Guarantor also agrees that the “fair market value” provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 580a shall have no applicability with respect to the determination of Affiliated Guarantor’s liability under the Loan Documents. 

^^^WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF ANY OTHER WAIVER OR OTHER PROVISION SET FORTH IN THIS AFFILIATED GUARANTY, AFFILIATED GUARANTOR HEREBY ABSOLUTELY, KNOWINGLY, UNCONDITIONALLY, AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES, ANY AND ALL BENEFITS OR DEFENSES ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY UNDER ANY ONE OR MORE OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTIONS 2787 through 2855, CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTIONS 580a, 580b, 580c, 580d, AND 726, AND CHAPTER 2 OF TITLE 14 OF PART 4 OF DIVISION 3 OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE AND CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL CODE SECTIONS 3116, 3118, 3119, 3419, 3605, 9610, 9615, 9617, 9621, 9625, 9626, and 9627. 

^WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING ANY LAW ENACTED AFTER THE DATE OF THIS AFFILIATED GUARANTY, AFFILIATED GUARANTOR AND LENDER EACH HEREBY ABSOLUTELY, KNOWINGLY, UNCONDITIONALLY, AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, DEMAND, OR PROCEEDING ARISING UNDER OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AFFILIATED GUARANTY, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH, RELATED TO, OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF AFFILIATED GUARANTOR AND LENDER WITH RESPECT TO THIS AFFILIATED GUARANTY, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AFFILIATED GUARANTOR AND LENDER EACH HEREBY AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, DEMAND, OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE DECIDED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT AFFILIATED GUARANTOR OR LENDER MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT OR OTHER TRIBUNAL AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF AFFILIATED GUARANTOR OR LENDER TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. 

^Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. Affiliated Guarantor agrees to pay, on demand, all attorneys’ fees (including attorneys’ fees incurred pursuant to proceedings arising under the Bankruptcy Code) and all other costs and expenses which may be incurred by Lender in the enforcement of this Affiliated Guaranty (including those brought relating to proceedings pursuant to 11 U.S.C.) or in any way arising out of, or consequential to the protection, assertion, or enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations (or any security therefor), whether or not suit is brought. 

^Cumulative Remedies. No remedy under this Affiliated Guaranty or under the Affiliated Subordinate Deed of Trust is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but each and every remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any and every other remedy given hereunder or under the Affiliated Subordinate Deed of Trust, and those provided by law or in equity. No delay or omission by Lender to exercise any right under this Affiliated Guaranty shall impair any such right nor be construed to be a waiver thereof. No failure on the part of Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. 

^Successors and Assigns. This Affiliated Guaranty shall be binding upon Affiliated Guarantor’s heirs, executors, administrators, representatives, successors, and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Lender; provided, however, Affiliated Guarantor shall not assign this Affiliated Guaranty or delegate any of its duties hereunder without Lender’s prior written consent which may be given in Lender’s sole discretion. Any assignment without the consent of Lender shall be absolutely void. In the event of any assignment or other transfer of rights by Lender, the rights and benefits herein conferred upon Lender shall automatically extend to and be vested in such assignee or other transferee. 

^Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Affiliated Guaranty and the Affiliated Subordinate Deed of Trust constitute the entire agreement between Affiliated Guarantor and Lender pertaining to the subject matter contained herein. This Affiliated Guaranty may not be altered, amended, or modified, nor may any provision hereof be waived or noncompliance therewith consented to, except by means of a writing executed by both Affiliated Guarantor and Lender. Any such alteration, amendment, modification, waiver, or consent shall be effective only to the extent specified therein and for the specific purpose for which given. No course of dealing and no delay or waiver of any right or default under this Affiliated Guaranty shall be deemed a waiver of any other, similar or dissimilar right or default or otherwise prejudice the rights and remedies hereunder. 

^Notices. All notices or demands by Affiliated Guarantor or Lender to the other relating to this Affiliated Guaranty shall be in writing and either personally served or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or by recognized courier service which provides return receipts, and shall be deemed delivered on the date of actual delivery or refusal to accept delivery as evidenced by the return receipt. Unless otherwise specified in a notice sent or delivered in accordance with the provisions of this section, such writing shall be sent, if to Affiliated Guarantor, then at Affiliated Guarantor’s address set forth in the Defined Terms, and if to Lender, then at Lender’s address set forth in the Defined Terms. 

^Acknowledgments. Affiliated Guarantor hereby acknowledges (i) that Affiliated Guarantor has been advised by legal counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Guaranty and with full knowledge of their significance and consequences and (ii) Lender has no fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Affiliated Guarantor or any other person arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. 

^Construction. Unless the context of this Affiliated Guaranty clearly requires otherwise, references to the plural include the singular, references to the singular include the plural, and the term “including” is not limiting. The words “hereof,” “herein,” “hereby,” “hereunder,” and other similar terms refer to this Affiliated Guaranty as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Affiliated Guaranty. Any reference herein to any of the Loan Documents includes any and all alterations, amendments, extensions, modifications, renewals, or supplements thereto or thereof, as applicable. Neither this Affiliated Guaranty nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed or resolved against Lender or Affiliated Guarantor, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise. This Affiliated Guaranty has been reviewed by Affiliated Guarantor, Lender, and their respective counsel, and shall be construed and interpreted so as to fairly accomplish the purposes and intentions of Lender and Affiliated Guarantor. 

^Severability of Provisions. If any provision of this Affiliated Guaranty is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, that provision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Affiliated Guaranty. 

^Understandings With Respect to Waivers and Consents. Affiliated Guarantor warrants and agrees that each of the waivers and consents set forth are made after consultation with legal counsel and with full knowledge of their significance and consequences, with the understanding that events giving rise to a defense or right may diminish, destroy, or otherwise adversely affect rights which Affiliated Guarantor otherwise may have against the Borrower, or against any collateral, and that, under the circumstances the waivers and consents herein given are reasonable and not contrary to public policy or law. If any of the waivers or consents are determined to be unenforceable under applicable law, such waivers and consents shall be effective to the maximum extent permitted by law.
