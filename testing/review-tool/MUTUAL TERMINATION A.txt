against a Party or any of its Related Parties or which, whether currently known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, foreseen or unforeseen, anticipated or unanticipated, such Party or its Related Parties, or any successors or assigns thereof, ever could have asserted or ever could assert, in any capacity, against the other Parties or their respective Related Parties, in any capacity, relating to any Action from any time in connection with or relating to the Service Agreements (collectively, the “Released General Claims”); *provided*, *however*, that (i) no Party shall be released from any breach of this Agreement, including any failure to pay any amount due to another Party in accordance with this Agreement or the Final Reconciliation Statement (once it is final and binding upon the Parties in accordance with the term of this Agreement with respect to the item or amount in question), (ii) Guarantor shall not be released from any breach of the New Guaranty, including any failure to pay any amount due to ABX in accordance therewith, (iii) no Party shall be released from any Actions asserted after the Effective Termination Time under the confidentiality, nondisclosure and indemnification provisions of the Service Agreements which arise from or out of, are based upon, or are in connection with or relate to events occurring prior to, on or after the Effective Termination Time, and (iv) any Actions which may arise in accordance with preceding clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) are explicitly excluded from the definition of Released General Claims. 

^^Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of ATSG and ABX, for and on behalf of itself and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, its Related Parties, does hereby unequivocally release and discharge DHL and any of its Related Parties, from any and all Actions that in any way arise from or out of, are based upon, or are in connection with or relate to any “employee benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the regulations thereunder) and any other statutory or non-statutory benefit or compensatory plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement (including workers’ compensation arrangements, severance arrangements or qualified or non-qualified pension plans), in each case that have been maintained, or contributed to, by ATSG or ABX since [[Date 2]], and any and all other liabilities of ATSG or ABX that relate to any such plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement, including Actions involving (i) the funding or funded status (including any underfunding) of any such plan, document, benefit or arrangement or (ii) any breach, non-performance, action or failure to act under the Service Agreements or in connection therewith, in each case, which have been asserted against DHL or any of its Related Parties or which, whether currently known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, foreseen or unforeseen, anticipated or unanticipated, ever could have been asserted or ever could be asserted against DHL or any of its Related Parties, in any capacity, relating to any Action from or after [[Date 2]] in connection with the foregoing (collectively, the “Released Benefit Claims” and, together with the Released General Claims, the “Released Claims”); *provided*, *however*, that (i) Network Operations shall not be released from any failure to pay any amount due to ATSG or ABX in respect of pension liabilities in accordance with the Final Reconciliation Statement or from any Actions which may arise in connection therewith, and (ii) neither DHL nor the Guarantor shall be released from any failure to pay any amount due to ABX in respect of workers’ compensation liabilities in accordance with Section 2.6 hereof or in accordance with the New Guaranty or from any Actions which may arise in connection therewith. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Service Agreements impose no obligation on Network Operations, DHL Express or any of their respective Related Parties with respect to any pension plan (whether or not tax-qualified) or comparable document, benefit or arrangement maintained by ATSG or ABX since [[Date 2]], other than the reimbursement of a

specified portion of the annual accounting charge associated with ABX’s pension plans. From the Effective Termination Time, ATSG and ABX shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless DHL and each of its Related Parties (the “DHL Indemnified Parties”) from and against all Actions (including reasonable fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements) actually incurred and paid by the DHL Indemnified Parties) asserted against the DHL Indemnified Parties in connection with any Released Benefit Claims on or after the Effective Termination Time. ATSG and ABX shall have the right to control the defense of any such Action for which indemnification is sought by the DHL Indemnified Parties under this Section 1.3(b). In the event neither ATSG nor ABX assumes control of the defense of any such Action, the DHL Indemnified Party against whom such Action is asserted will be entitled to advancement of reasonable expenses expected to be incurred in the defense of such Action from ATSG and ABX within 10 calendar days of receipt by ATSG and ABX from such DHL Indemnified Party of a written request therefor, which request shall specify in reasonable detail the projected allocation and uses of such advanced amounts. Any such advanced amounts, to the extent not actually incurred and paid by such DHL Indemnified Party in the defense of such Action, shall promptly be returned to ATSG or ABX (as the case may be) upon the final disposition of such Action. If either ATSG or ABX, or any of their respective successors or assigns, shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, such Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of such Party shall expressly assume all of the obligations of such Party set forth in this Section 1.3(b). In addition, ATSG and ABX shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, which are actually incurred and paid by any DHL Indemnified Party in connection with its enforcement of the foregoing rights provided in this Section 1.3(b), but only if and to the extent such DHL Indemnified Party ultimately prevails in such enforcement. 

^^It is understood and agreed that, except as otherwise expressly set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 1.3, the preceding paragraphs of this Section 1.3 are a full and final release covering all known as well as unknown or unanticipated debts, claims or damages of the Parties and their Related Parties relating to or arising out of the Service Agreements and, in the case of ATSG and ABX, relating to or arising out of any pension plan or comparable document, benefit or arrangement maintained by ATSG or ABX since [[Date 2]], and any and all other liabilities of ATSG or ABX that relate to any such pension plan or comparable document, benefit or arrangement. Therefore, each of the Parties expressly waives any rights it may have under statute or common law principle under which a general release does not extend to claims which such Party does not know or suspect to exist in its favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by such Party must have affected such Party’s settlement with the other. In connection with such waiver and relinquishment, the Parties acknowledge that they or their attorneys or agents may hereafter discover claims or facts in addition to or different from those which they now know or believe to exist with respect to the Released Claims, but that it is their intention hereby fully, finally and forever to settle and release all of the Released Claims, as further set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 1.3. In furtherance of this intention, the releases herein given shall, except as otherwise expressly set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 1.3, be and remain in effect as full and complete mutual releases with regard to the Released Claims notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or different claim or fact.

^^Each Party acknowledges that it has been advised by legal counsel and is familiar with the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides as follows: 

^GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. 

Each Party, being aware of said code section, agrees to expressly waive any rights it may have thereunder, as well as under any other statute or common law principles of similar effect, with respect to any other Party under the Service Agreements, except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 1.3.

^Review and Adjustment Procedures 

^^The Draft Reconciliation Statement shall become final and binding (such statement, once final and binding upon the Parties, the “Final Reconciliation Statement” and, together with the Draft Reconciliation Statement, the “Reconciliation Statement”) upon the Parties at 11:59 p.m., eastern daylight time, on [[Date 9: Date]] (such time on such date, the “Objection Cut-Off Time”), unless DHL provides ABX with written notice (the “Objection Notice”) of its good faith objection to any of the items, amounts or calculations included in the Draft Reconciliation Statement (the “Objections”) prior to the Objection Cut-Off Time. The 

Note: It is expected that Appendix A will represent the exact form of Draft Reconciliation Statement to be delivered by ABX pursuant to Section 2.1, but will only reflect sample numbers determined as of a date reasonably in advance of the parties’ execution of this Agreement. Accordingly, although the categories or classes of amounts owed by one party to the other that appear in Appendix A will be the same categories and classes that appear in the Draft Reconciliation Statement, the parties acknowledge that the numbers reflected in the Draft Reconciliation Statement may differ from the sample numbers reflected in Appendix A.

\centered Those portions of this Agreement marked with an [*] have been omitted pursuant to a request for confidential

Objection Notice will contain reasonable written explanations of the Objections and the amendment and adjustments which DHL believes should be made to the Draft Reconciliation Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that DHL may raise an Objection based on its good faith belief that ABX has failed to comply with its obligations under Section 2.5. If a Notice of Objection is delivered to ABX prior to the Objection Cut-Off Time, then (i) the Draft Reconciliation Statement as to the particular items, or portions thereof, that are not the subject of an Objection shall become final and binding upon the Parties at the Objection Cut-Off Time and (ii) the Draft Reconciliation Statement as to any particular items, or portions thereof, that are the subject of an Objection shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier of (A) the date that ABX, Network Operations and DHL Express agree, in writing, upon the resolution of such Objection or (B) the date on which such Objection is finally resolved in writing by the Independent Auditor, in each case pursuant to the resolution procedures set forth in Section 2.2(b). 

^^The process for resolving any Objections shall be: 

^^^For the 30 day period following the receipt of the Objection Notice, ABX and DHL will attempt in good faith to resolve in writing the Objections. 

^^^If ABX and DHL are unable to resolve their disagreements with respect to any of the Objections within the time period specified in Section 2.2(b)(i), they shall refer any unresolved Objections to Ernst & Young LLP or, if Ernst & Young LLP shall for some reason be unable to act with respect to the unresolved Objections, to a nationally-recognized firm of independent certified public accountants as to which the Parties mutually agree (the “Independent Auditor”), who will determine, based solely on the information submitted by ABX and DHL (and not by independent review), and only with respect to the unresolved Objections so submitted, whether and to what extent the items, amounts or calculations included in the Draft Reconciliation Statement that are the subject of the unresolved Objections require adjustment. The Independent Auditor will resolve each remaining unresolved Objection in favor of either ABX or DHL by determining which party’s submission was, in the aggregate, calculated more in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. The Independent Auditor’s determination of the unresolved Objections will be final and binding upon the Parties. ABX and DHL will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Auditor to make its determination as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 30 calendar days following submission of the unresolved Objections to the Independent Auditor for final resolution. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor will be allocated between ABX and DHL in the same proportion as the aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted to the Independent Auditor that are unsuccessfully disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the Independent Auditor) bears to the total amount of disputed items submitted to the Independent Auditor. ABX’s portion of the fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall not be reimbursable by DHL under the Service Agreements, this Agreement or any of the New Agreements.

^^^the aggregate amount owed to ABX as the Put Price for (A) the 31 DC-9 aircraft that ABX put to Network Operations under the ACMI Agreement on [[Date 11: Date]] and [[Date 12: Date]], and (B) the 5 767 aircraft that ABX put to Network Operations under the ACMI Agreement on [[Date 13: Date]] (such DC-9 aircraft and 767 aircraft, collectively, the “Put Aircraft”), is (x) $[[USD Value 3: Number]], less (y) any amounts actually paid by DHL with respect to the Put Aircraft prior to the settlement of the amounts due under the Final Reconciliation Statement (such final amount, the “Final Put Price”);

^^^each of those items and amounts contained in Part 2 of the Draft Reconciliation Statement, except for the amount to be included in Part 2 of the Final Reconciliation Statement under the caption “Professional Fees”.

^^For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any item or amount expressly agreed to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (vi) or (vii), of Section 2.3(a), (i) DHL is not entitled to provide an Objection Notice with respect to any such item or amount; *provided*, *however*, that DHL may raise an Objection with respect to any such items or amounts to the extent that there is a discrepancy between Section 2.3(a) and the Draft Reconciliation Statement (in which case Section 2.3(a) shall control), and (ii) ABX shall not seek reimbursement under the Service Agreements with respect to any such item or amount except as expressly agreed to in Section 2.3(a) of this Agreement. Further, DHL is not entitled to provide an Objection Notice with respect to an item or amount that was previously settled under the Service Agreements for any accounting period prior to [[Date 14: Date]], except to the extent that an amount for such item is included in the Draft Reconciliation Statement, and except with respect to an amount associated with an item cited in Part 4 of Appendix A. 

^^The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) ABX has made a provision for, and is liable for, not less than $[*] for salary costs (plus the directly related employer payroll taxes) associated with retroactive compensation payments to flight crewmember employees incurred by ABX in connection with the New Pilots CBA (as defined below), (ii) ABX has already accrued the retroactive compensation payments (and directly related employer payroll taxes) referred to in the foregoing clause (i), and (iii) the Final Reconciliation Statement shall include, to the extent that DHL has not already done so, reimbursement of ABX for such retroactive compensation payment (and directly related employer payroll taxes); *provided*, *however*, that in no event shall Network Operations be liable for (x) any such retroactive compensation payment in excess of $[*] in the aggregate (including all amounts previously paid by DHL with respect to such retroactive compensation payment), and (y) aggregate employer payroll taxes related to such retroactive compensation payment in excess of $[*] (including all amounts previously paid by DHL with respect to such related employer payroll taxes). The sum of the amounts specified in clauses (x) and (y) of the immediately preceding sentence are hereinafter referred to as the “Retroactive Compensation Cap”. ABX agrees that it will not seek, and Network Operations and its affiliates shall have no liability for, any additional salary costs or any other costs (including employer payroll taxes related to this retroactive compensation) under the ACMI Agreement in respect of retroactive compensation payments incurred or accrued in connection with the New Pilots CBA above and beyond the Retroactive Compensation Cap.

^^Following payment in full by DHL of the Final Put Price, ABX shall, on or prior to [[Date 15: Date]], transfer title to the Put Aircraft to Network Operations or its affiliate (as determined by DHL) in the manner provided in Exhibit C to the ACMI Agreement and free from any and all encumbrances other than the encumbrances set forth on Appendix B hereof.

For the avoidance of doubt, no Party shall have any obligation to make a payment to another Party hereto of any amount contained in the Final Reconciliation Statement unless such amount (a) has been identified and agreed to in Section 2.3(a) hereof, or (b) has otherwise become final and binding upon the Parties in accordance with Section 2.2.

From the date hereof through the later of (i) the Objection Cut-Off Time and (ii) the date upon which the final Objection is resolved in accordance with Section 2.2, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times, ABX will give DHL and its representatives reasonable access to supporting records and analyses and financial personnel to the extent necessary to permit DHL to review and validate those amounts contained in the Draft Reconciliation Statement which have not yet been identified and agreed to in Section 2.3(a) hereof or otherwise become final and binding upon the Parties in accordance with Section 2.2.

^Workers’ Compensation 

^^Upon execution of the New Agreements, DHL will pay ABX and/or its affiliate (as determined by ABX) $[*] related to the ABX workers’ compensation liability accrual under the Service Agreements. This payment, combined with the $[*] of accrued amounts previously reimbursed by DHL under the Service Agreements, results in a total amount of ABX workers’ compensation liability accrual reimbursed by DHL under the Service Agreements [*] (the “Initial WC Reimbursement Amount”). The Initial WC Reimbursement Amount represents an initial estimate of claims (inclusive of state assessments, legal fees and administrative costs, but not the management of the claims which is addressed separately in Section 2.6(f)) arising from workers’ compensation injuries incurred in connection with the provision of services to DHL under the Service Agreements through the date of termination or expiration, as applicable, of each of the Service Agreements (hereinafter, “WC Claims”).

^^From the date hereof until the final amount of the WC Claims is determined and settled in accordance with the process outlined in this Section 2.6, ABX will report its cumulative payment of WC Claims development on a quarterly basis and DHL will reimburse ABX within 5 business days of the receipt of such report for any amounts paid out by ABX in settlement of WC Claims in excess of the Initial WC Reimbursement Amount plus any subsequent payments made by DHL pursuant to this Section 2.6. 

^^The actuarial principal estimate of $[*] contained in the actuarial valuation previously obtained by ABX (a true and complete copy of which has been provided to DHL) in estimating the expected liability for WC Claims under the Service Agreements as of [[Date 18: Date]], shall be considered the “Opening WC Valuation.” ABX shall, by 5:00 p.m., eastern standard time, on [[Date 19: Date]] (or earlier upon the agreement of the Parties), deliver to DHL, an actuarial principal estimate from a qualified actuarial firm of the outstanding workers compensation liability related to the WC Claims as of [[Date 20: Date]]. DHL may accept the actuarial principal estimate or shall have the right to obtain a second actuarial valuation from a qualified actuarial firm of the then outstanding workers compensation liability related to the WC Claims. If DHL accepts the actuarial principal estimate contained in the ABX valuation or if the actuarial principal estimates contained in the two valuations are within [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of each other, the actuarial principal estimate contained in the ABX valuation will be accepted as the “Closing WC Valuation.” If the actuarial principal estimate contained in the two valuations are not within [[Percentage 1]]% of each other, but ABX accepts the actuarial principal estimate contained in the DHL valuation, the actuarial principal valuation contained in the DHL valuation will become the “Closing WC Valuation.” In the event that (i) DHL does not accept the ABX valuation, (ii) the actuarial principal estimate contained in the two valuations are not within [[Percentage 1]]% of each other or (iii) ABX does not accept the DHL valuation, the final settlement of the workers compensation liability related to the WC Claims will be delayed and the foregoing process will be repeated on an annual basis (or earlier upon the agreement of the Parties) until the earliest to occur of (A) DHL accepts the actuarial principal estimate then obtained by ABX, (B) the actuarial principal estimate contained in the two valuations are within [[Percentage 1]]% of each other or (C) ABX accepts the actuarial principal estimate then obtained by DHL. In the event that a Closing WC Valuation has not been established under the foregoing process prior to ABX’s obtaining a third valuation in accordance with the foregoing process, then the third such ABX valuation will constitute Closing WC Valuation. 

\centered Those portions of this Agreement marked with an [*] have been omitted pursuant to a request for confidential 

\centered treatment and have been filed separately with the SEC. 

^^If: 

^^^the aggregate value of the Closing WC Valuation plus the amount of any cash distributions made by ABX for WC Claims after [[Date 18]] (the “Final WC Claims Amount”) is greater than the Initial WC Reimbursement Amount plus any additional funding provided by DHL (the “Final WC Reimbursement Amount”), then DHL will pay the difference to ABX within 30 days of the date on which Closing WC Valuation is established;

^^^the Final WC Claims Amount is less than the Final WC Reimbursement Amount and is also less than the Opening WC Valuation, then the Parties will allocate the difference as follows: (A) [*]% of the first $[*] of the amount by which the Final WC Claims Amount is less than the Opening WC Valuation will be credited to ABX; (B) [*]% of the next $[*] of the amount by which the Final WC Claims Amount is less than the Opening WC Valuation (in excess of the first $[*] in the aggregate) will be credited to each of ABX and DHL; and (C) [*]% of any remaining money (in excess of the first $[*] in the aggregate) will be credited to DHL, and any payments necessary to give effect to the foregoing will be made by the appropriate Party within 30 days of the date on which Closing WC Valuation is established;

^^^the total of the Final WC Claims Amount plus any aggregate amount allocated to ABX pursuant to clause (ii) above is less than the Final Reimbursement Amount, then such difference will be repaid to DHL by ABX within 30 days of the date on which Closing WC Valuation is established.

^^If the Parties agree to settle the workers compensation liability related to the WC Claims at a date prior to the [[Date 20]] valuation date or defer such settlement in accordance with Section 2.6(c), each Party will be entitled to receive [*]% of the amount determined in accordance with Section 2.6(d) based on the actuarial principal estimate as of the date of settlement without any pro-ration or other adjustment based on using a date other than [[Date 20]]. 

^^In consideration for ABX managing the workers compensation claims, and in addition to any amounts otherwise payable by DHL to ABX pursuant to this Section 2.6, DHL will pay ABX equal monthly installments totaling $[*] per annum for a period of 3 years, commencing upon the Effective Termination Time. No such additional fee will be payable after the third anniversary of the date hereof. In the event that the Parties settle the workers compensation liability prior to the end of the third anniversary of the date hereof or DHL terminates the Air Transportation Services Agreement, then, in conjunction with such settlement or termination, DHL shall pay to ABX an amount equal to the remaining monthly installments that ABX would have otherwise been entitled to receive under this Section 2.6 for continuing to manage such workers compensation claims. 

\centered Those portions of this Agreement marked with an [*] have been omitted pursuant to a request for confidential

^Additional Matters. 

The Parties also hereby agree as follows: 

^^At the end of each calendar month following the Effective Termination Time, the principal amount of the Note shall be reduced in equal installments of $[*] for the first 59 months and shall be further reduced by $[*] at the end of the 60th month, resulting in the Note being extinguished in its entirety as of the end of the 60th month; *provided, however,* that if Network Operations has terminated the Air Transportation Services Agreement as a result of an ABX event of default thereunder (as provided under the Air Transportation Services Agreement) prior to the end of the 60th month, then no further installment reductions shall occur from and after the date of any such termination and the remaining principal amount of the Note as of the date of such termination (after giving effect to all prior installment reductions under this Section 2.7(a)) will remain outstanding and payable in accordance with its terms. In the event that Network Operations terminates the Air Transportation Services Agreement for its convenience (as provided under the Air Transportation Services Agreement) prior to the end of the 60th month, the remaining principal amount of the Note will be extinguished in its entirety as of the date of such termination. The Parties will amend the Note as of [[Date 21: Date]] of each year to reflect the cumulative reduction in the principal amount thereof. 

^^Concurrently with the execution of the New Agreements, DHL will pay ABX and/or one of its affiliates (as determined by ABX) an amount totaling $[*] by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by ABX in Appendix C. Thereafter, on each of the first and second anniversaries of the date on which the New Agreements are executed, DHL will further pay ABX and/or one of its affiliates (as determined by ABX) an additional amount totaling $[*] by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by ABX in Appendix C (or to such other account(s) as ABX may designate in writing at least 2 business days prior to the relevant anniversary); *provided*, *however*, that, with respect to any such additional amount to be paid by DHL to ABX on the first or second anniversary of the date on which the New Agreements are executed, if (i) the Air Transportation Services Agreement has been terminated by DHL as a result of an event of default by ABX thereunder (as provided under the Air Transportation Services Agreement) on or prior to such anniversary, then, DHL shall have no obligation to pay such additional amount to ABX pursuant to this Section 2.7(b), which amount shall be treated as liquidated damages and shall be DHL’s sole monetary remedy under this Section 2.7(b), or (ii) ABX is in default of the Air Transportation Services Agreement on such anniversary, then DHL shall have no obligation to pay such additional amount to ABX pursuant to this Section 2.7(b) unless and until ABX cures such default, (it being understood that DHL shall pay to ABX such additional amount as of the date that ABX cures such default). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) assuming no event described in clauses (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding proviso has occurred on or prior to the first or second anniversary of the date on which the New Agreements are executed, the aggregate amount of all payments that will be made by DHL under this Section 2.7(b) is $[*], and (y) the payment by DHL to an affiliate of ABX (at the direction of ABX) of any amount which DHL is obligated to pay under this Section 2.7(b) shall be in full satisfaction of such payment obligation.

^ILN Sublease; Environmental Indemnification 

^^Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, DHL and ABX shall amend that certain Wilmington Air Park Sublease between DHL Express, as the successor to Airborne, and ABX, dated [[Date 2]], on or before [[Date 7]], to provide that the term thereof shall remain in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (i) [[Date 22: Date]], or (ii) such time as DHL conveys ILN to the CCPA. 

^^DHL Express, DPWN Holdings and Network Operations shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless ABX and each of its Related Parties (the “ABX Indemnified Parties”) from and against all Actions (including reasonable fees, costs and expenses (including attorney’s fees and disbursements) actually incurred and paid by the ABX Indemnified Parties) asserted against the ABX Indemnified Parties in connection with (i) the fish kill incident alleged by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to have taken place on or about [[Date 23: Date]], or (ii) any failure by DHL to bring the storm water treatment facilities at ILN into regulatory compliance prior to the donation of ILN to the CCPA by DHL. DHL Express, DPWN Holdings and Network Operations shall have the right to control the defense of any such Action for which indemnification is sought by the ABX Indemnified Parties under this Section 2.8(b). In the event none of DHL Express, DPWN Holdings or Network Operations assumes control of the defense of any such Action, the ABX Indemnified Party against whom such Action is asserted will be entitled to advancement of reasonable expenses expected to be incurred in the defense of such Action from DHL Express, DPWN Holdings and Network Operations within 10 calendar days of receipt by DHL Express, DPWN Holdings and Network Operations from such ABX Indemnified Party of a written request therefor, which request shall specify in reasonable detail the projected allocation and uses of such advanced amounts. Any such advanced amounts, to the extent not actually incurred and paid by such ABX Indemnified Party in the defense of such Action, shall promptly be returned to DHL Express, DPWN Holdings or Network Operations (as the case may be) upon the final disposition of such Action. If any of DHL Express, DPWN Holdings or Network Operations, or any of their respective successors or assigns, shall (x) consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (y) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, such Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of such Party shall expressly assume all of the obligations of such Party set forth in this Section 2.8(b). In addition, DHL Express, DPWN Holdings and Network Operations shall jointly and severally pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, which are actually incurred and paid by any ABX Indemnified Party in connection with its enforcement of the foregoing rights provided in this Section 2.8(b), but only if and to the extent such ABX Indemnified Party ultimately prevails in such enforcement.
