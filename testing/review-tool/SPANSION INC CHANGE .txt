\centered RECITALS 

^It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control. The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to the Executive and can cause the Executive to consider alternative employment opportunities. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its securityholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company. 

^The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its securityholders to provide the Executive with an incentive to continue the Executive’s employment and to motivate the Executive to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its securityholders. 

^The Board believes that it is imperative to provide the Executive with severance benefits upon the Executive’s termination of employment following a Change of Control that provides the Executive with enhanced financial security and provides incentive and encouragement to the Executive to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control. 

^Certain capitalized terms used in the Agreement are defined in Section 4 below. 

The parties hereto agree as follows: 

^Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective on the latest date set forth by the signatures of the parties hereto below (the “Effective Date”). Following the Effective Date, this Agreement shall not be terminated as long as the Executive remains in the position of [insert executive officer title]. If the Executive no longer holds the title of [insert executive officer title], this Agreement shall terminate upon the date that all obligations of the parties hereto with respect to this Agreement have been satisfied or upon cancellation with written notice by either of the parties setting forth the effective date of such cancellation; *provided*, *however*, that the effective date of such cancellation shall in no event be earlier than two (2) years from the date on which the written notice of cancellation is given. If, prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Executive ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason, then this Agreement shall terminate on the effective date of the Executive’s termination of employment. 

^At-Will Employment. The Company and the Executive acknowledge that the Executive’s employment is and shall continue to be “at-will,” as defined under applicable law. The Executive understands that nothing in this Agreement modifies the Executive’s “at-will” 

employment status with the Company; the Company or the Executive may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause subject to the benefits provided to the Executive under this Agreement. 

^Change of Control Severance Benefits. 

^^Involuntary Termination other than for Cause, Death or Disability or Voluntary Termination for Good Reason Following A Change of Control. If, within twelve (12) months following a Change of Control, the Executive’s employment is terminated involuntarily by the Company other than for Cause, or due to death or Disability, or by the Executive pursuant to a Voluntary Termination for Good Reason, and the Executive executes and does not revoke a general release of claims against the Company and its affiliates in a form acceptable to the Company within 60 days after the date of Executive’s termination of employment, then the Company shall provide the Executive with the benefits set forth below: 

^^^Cash Award. A lump sum payment in an amount equal to the Executive’s monthly base salary immediately prior to such employment termination multiplied by the number of months in the Severance Period, in addition to any other earned but unpaid compensation due through the date of such termination. This lump sum payment is to be paid as soon as practicable after the effective date of the employment termination but in any event no later than 60 days after the effective date of the employment termination. 

^^^Acceleration of Vesting of Equity Awards. All vesting for (AA) outstanding options to purchase the common stock of the Company or any affiliate of the Company granted under any equity plan of the Company or affiliate of the Company then held by the Executive, (BB) restricted stock granted under any equity plan of the Company or affiliate of the Company then held by the Executive and (CC) other equity and equity equivalent awards granted under any equity plan of the Company or affiliate of the Company then held by the Executive shall be accelerated in full to on or before the effective employment termination date, and thereafter all such options, restricted stock and other equity awards shall be immediately vested, and, where applicable, exercisable for such period of time following termination as provided for by the specific agreements governing each such award. 

^^^Benefits Continuation. During the Severance Period, the Company shall pay directly, on behalf of the Executive, or reimburse the Executive, at the Executive’s option, for premium costs incurred by the Executive and the Executive’s dependents for continued health care coverage under the applicable plans maintained by the Company, pursuant to Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Sections 601-608 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and under any other applicable state law, to the extent required by such laws. 

^^^Entire Change of Control Benefits. All of the foregoing benefits shall replace and be in lieu of any other severance benefit(s) to which Executive would otherwise be entitled following a Change of Control. 

^^Voluntary Resignation; Termination For Cause. If the Executive’s employment terminates by reason of the Executive’s voluntary resignation (and is not a Voluntary Termination for Good Reason), or if the Executive is terminated for Cause, then the Executive shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits pursuant to this Agreement. In such event, the Executive shall receive all earned but unpaid compensation as may be required by law. 

^^Disability; Death. If the Executive’s employment with the Company terminates as a result of the Executive’s Disability, or if the Executive’s employment is terminated due to the death of the Executive, then the Executive or the Executive’s estate shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits pursuant to this Agreement. In such event, the Executive or the Executive’s estate shall receive all earned but unpaid compensation as may be required by law. 

^^Termination Apart from Change of Control. In the event the Executive’s employment is terminated for any reason not related to a Change of Control prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, or for any reason after the twenty-four (24) month period following a Change of Control, then the Executive shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits pursuant to this Agreement. In such event, the Executive shall receive all earned but unpaid compensation as may be required by law (or any benefits to which Executive is entitled pursuant to his offer letter agreement with the Company).

Termination resulting from Disability may only be effected after at least thirty (30) days’ written notice by the Company of its intention to terminate the Executive’s employment. In the event that the Executive resumes the performance of substantially all of the Executive’s Company duties before the termination of the Executive’s employment becomes effective, the notice of intent to terminate shall automatically be deemed to have been revoked.

^Confidentiality; Non-Solicitation. 

^^Confidentiality. While the Executive is employed by the Company or an affiliate of the Company, and thereafter, the Executive shall not directly or indirectly disclose or make available to any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever, any Confidential Information (as defined below). Upon termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company (or affiliate of the Company), all Confidential Information in the Executive’s possession that is in written or other tangible form (together with all copies or duplicates thereof, including computer files) shall be returned to the Company and shall not be retained by the Executive or furnished to any third party, in any form, except as provided herein; *provided, however*, that the Executive shall not be obligated to treat as confidential any Confidential Information that (i) was publicly known at the time of disclosure to the Executive, (ii) becomes publicly known or available thereafter other than by any means in violation of this Agreement or any other duty owed to the Company by any person or entity or (iii) is lawfully disclosed to the Executive by a third party.

^^Survival of Provisions. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the termination or expiration of the Executive’s employment with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state that any restriction in this Section 7 is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under the laws of that state, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law of that state. 

^Code Section 280G. 

^^In the event that: (i) the aggregate payments or benefits to be made or afforded to the Executive which are deemed to be “parachute payments” as defined in Section 280G of the Code or any successor thereof, (the “Termination Benefits”) would be deemed to include an “excess parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Code; and (ii) if (A) such Termination Benefits were reduced to an amount (the “Non-Triggering Amount”), the value of which is one dollar ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]) less than an amount equal to three times the Executive’s “base amount,” as determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code, and (B) the Non-Triggering Amount less the product of the marginal rate of any applicable state and federal income tax and the Non-Triggering Amount would be greater than the aggregate value of the Termination Benefits (without such reduction) minus (a) the amount of tax required to be paid by the Executive thereon by Section 4999 of the Code and further minus (b) the product of the Termination Benefits and the marginal rate of any applicable state and federal income tax, then (iii) the Termination Benefits shall be reduced to the Non-Triggering Amount. 

^^If it is determined that the Executive’s Termination Benefits shall be reduced pursuant to Section 8(a), the Termination Benefits shall be reduced in the following order: (i) the cash severance payment in Section 3(a)(i), (ii) the acceleration of vesting of equity awards described in Section 3(a)(ii), and (iii) the benefits continuation described in Section 3(a)(iii). 

^^Any determination of whether there will be a limitation on payments to the Executive pursuant to Section 8(a) above shall be made by the nationally recognized certified public accounting firm used by the Company immediately prior to the Change of Control or, if such firm declines to serve, such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the “Accounting Firm”), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive not less than ten (10) business days prior to the Change of Control. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 8, the Accounting Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good-faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. 

^^The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would result in a loss by the Company of any portion if its tax deduction for payments made by the Company to the Executive due to the application of Section 280G of the Code. 

^^Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, the Company may withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service for the benefit of the Executive all or any portion of the applicable taxes under Section 4999 of the Code that it determines in good faith that it is or may be in the future required to withhold, and the Executive hereby consents to such withholding. 

^Arbitration and Equitable Relief. 

^^Except as provided in Section 9(d) below, the Executive and the Company agree that to the extent permitted by law, any dispute or controversy arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement, or the interpretation, validity, construction, performance, breach, or termination thereof will be settled by arbitration to be held in the County of Santa Clara, California, in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (the “Rules”). There will be one arbitrator who may grant injunctions or other relief in such dispute or controversy. The decision of the arbitrator will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties to the arbitration. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s decision in any court having jurisdiction. 

^^The arbitrator will apply California law to the merits of any dispute or claim, without reference to rules of conflict of law. The Executive hereby expressly consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in California for any action or proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement and/or relating to any arbitration in which the parties are participants. 

^^The Company will pay the direct costs and expenses of the arbitration. The Company and the Executive are responsible for their respective attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with enforcing this Agreement. 

^^The Company and the Executive may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, without breach of this arbitration agreement and without abridgement of the powers of the arbitrator. 

THE EXECUTIVE HAS READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS SECTION 9, WHICH DISCUSSES ARBITRATION. THE EXECUTIVE UNDERSTANDS THAT BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, THE EXECUTIVE AGREES TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TO SUBMIT ANY FUTURE CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE INTERPRETATION, VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE, BREACH, OR TERMINATION THEREOF TO BINDING ARBITRATION, AND THAT THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF THE EXECUTIVE’S RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND RELATES TO THE RESOLUTION OF ALL DISPUTES RELATING TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE EMPLOYER/EXECUTIVE RELATIONSHIP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING CLAIMS:

^^^Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, no amount deemed deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be payable to Executive hereunder unless Executive’s termination of employment constitutes a “separation from service” with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the 

Department of Treasury regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder. In addition, if Executive is deemed by the Company at the time of Executive’s separation from service to be a “specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such portion of Executive’s benefits shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of the Executive’s “separation from service” with the Company (as such term is defined in the Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code) or (ii) the date of Executive’s death.
