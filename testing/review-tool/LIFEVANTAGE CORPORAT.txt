^**Term**. This Warrant is exercisable at the option of the Holder, at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part (but not for a fraction of a share), at any time following the Effective Date and before 5:30 P.M. San Diego, California time on the earlier to occur of (a) the five year anniversary of the Effective Date or (b) (i) the closing of a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation where the Company is not the surviving corporation, or a reverse triangular merger in which the Company is the surviving entity but the shares of the Company’s capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property, whether in the form of securities, cash, or otherwise, or (ii) the closing of the sale of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of Company, unless the Company’s shareholders of record prior to such acquisition or sale shall hold at least fifty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the voting power of the acquiring or surviving entity immediately after the acquisition or sale (the earlier to occur of (a) or (b), the “**Expiration Date**”).

^**Exercise**.  

^^Payment. Subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of this Warrant and applicable securities laws, this Warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, from and after the Effective Date and on or before the Expiration Date by delivery of: 

^^^^^ 
^^a Notice of Exercise duly executed by the Holder to the Company at its principal office,

^^this Warrant to the Company at its principal office, and

^^payment in cash, by check or by wire transfer of an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Warrant Shares being purchased upon such exercise by the then effective Exercise Price.

^^Cashless Exercise. In lieu of the payment methods set forth in Section 2.1(c), this Warrant may also be exercised, in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, from and after the one year anniversary of the Effective Date and on or before the Expiration Date, by means of a “cashless exercise” in which Holder shall be entitled to receive a certificate for the number of Warrant Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where: 

\centered 

^=    the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Exercise Date 

^=    the Exercise Price of one share of Warrant Shares (as adjusted to the date of such calculation) 

^^^=    the number of Warrant Shares purchasable under this Warrant or, if only a portion of this Warrant is being exercised, the portion of this Warrant being canceled (at the date of such calculation)  

If the Holder elects to exercise this Warrant as provided in this Section 2.2, the Holder shall tender this Warrant for the amount being exercised, along with a Notice of Exercise duly executed by the Holder, to the Company at its then principal office, and the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of Warrant Shares computed using the formula above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Warrant may not be exercised on a cashless exercise basis if a registration statement registering the resale of the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise is effective as of the Exercise Date. 

^^Stock Certificates; Fractional Shares. As soon as practicable on or after any date of exercise of this Warrant pursuant to this Section 2, the Company shall issue and deliver to Holder a certificate or certificates for the number of whole shares of Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share equal to such fraction of the current Fair Market Value of one whole share of Warrant Shares as of the date of exercise of this Warrant. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon an exercise of this Warrant. 

^^Partial Exercise; Effective Date of Exercise. In case of any partial exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall cancel this Warrant upon surrender hereof and shall execute and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor and date for the balance of the shares of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately prior to the close of business on the date of its surrender for exercise as provided above. Holder shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of record of the Warrant Shares to which it is entitled upon exercise of this Warrant as of the close of business on the date the Holder is deemed to have exercised this Warrant. 

^^Exercise Price Adjustment. The Exercise Price in effect at any time and the number of Warrant Shares purchased upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time only upon the happening of the following events: 

^^Stock Dividends and Stock Splits. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions 

^^^^^ 
payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 2.5(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. 

^^Subsequent Equity Sales. Other than in respect of an Exempt Issuance, if, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, the Company sells any shares of Common Stock or sells any option or right entitling any Person to acquire shares of Common Stock at a price per share that is lower than $[[USD Value 2: Number]] (as adjusted for any events described in Section 2.5(a)) (such lower price, the “Base Exercise Price”), then the Exercise Price shall be reduced to equal the product of (i) the then current Exercise Price multiplied by (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the Base Exercise Price by 0.20 (as adjusted for any events described in Section 2.5(a)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.5(b), in no event shall the Exercise Price be reduced to less than $[[USD Value 3: Number]] (as adjusted for any events described in Section 2.5(a)) as a result of any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 2.5(b). 

^^Calculations. All calculations under this Section 2.5 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 2.5, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) issued and outstanding. 

^^Notice to the Holder of Adjustment to Exercise Price. Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 2.5, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Holder a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

^**Valid Issuance; Taxes**.
