\centered Loading Rack Throughput Agreement (Lovington) 

^^^^^ 
^^Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment. During the Term and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Navajo agrees as follows: 

^^^Subject to Section 4, Navajo shall pay HEP Lovington throughput fees associated with the Loading Rack that will satisfy the Minimum Loading Rack Commitment in exchange for HEP Lovington providing Navajo a minimum of 4,000 barrels per day of aggregate capacity at the Loading Rack. The “Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment” shall be an amount of revenue to HEP Lovington for each Contract Quarter determined by multiplying the Minimum Loading Rack Throughput by the Loading Rack Tariff as such Loading Rack Tariff may be revised pursuant to Section 2(a)(ii). Navajo will pay HEP Lovington the Loading Rack Tariff for all quantities of Products loaded at the Loading Rack. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Closing Date is any date other than the first day of a Contract Quarter, then the Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment for the initial Contract Quarter shall be prorated based upon the number of days actually in such contract quarter and the initial Contract Quarter. 

^^^The Loading Rack Tariff shall be adjusted on [[Date 4]] of each calendar year commencing on [[Date 10: Date]], by an amount equal to the upper change in the annual change rounded to four decimal places of the Producers Price Index-Commodities-Finished Goods, (PPI), et al. (“PPI”), produced by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureaus of Labor Statistics; provided that the Loading Rack Tariff shall never be increased by more than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% for any such calendar year. The series ID is WPUSOP3000 as of [[Date 11: Date]]  located at http://www.bls.gov/data/. The change factor shall be calculated as follows: annual PPI index (most current year) less annual PPI index (most current year minus 1) divided by annual PPI index (most current year minus 1). An example for year 2009 change is: [PPI (2008)  PPI (2007)] / PPI (2007) or (177.1  166.6) / 166.6 or .063 or [[Percentage 4: Number]]%. If the PPI index change is negative in a given year then there will be no change in the Loading Rack Tariff. If the above index is no longer published, then Navajo and HEP Lovington shall negotiate in good faith to agree on a new index that gives comparable protection against inflation, and the same method of adjustment for increases in the new index shall be used to calculate increases in the Loading Rack Tariff. If Navajo and HEP Lovington are unable to agree, a new index will be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with Section 11(e), and the same method of adjustment for increases in the new index shall be used to calculate increases in the Loading Rack Tariff. To evidence the Parties’ agreement to each adjusted Loading Rack Tariff, the Parties shall execute an amended, modified, revised or updated Schedule I and attach it to this Agreement. Such amended, modified, revised or updated Schedule I shall be sequentially numbered (e.g. Schedule I-1, Schedule I-2, etc.), dated and appended as an additional schedule to this Agreement and shall replace the prior version of Schedule I in its entirety. 

^^^If Navajo is unable to transport on the Loading Rack the volumes of Products required to meet the Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment as a result of HEP Lovington’s operational difficulties, prorationing, or the inability to provide sufficient capacity for the Minimum Loading Rack Throughput, then the Minimum 

\centered Loading Rack Throughput Agreement (Lovington) 

^^^^^ 
Loading Rack Revenue Commitment applicable to the Contract Quarter during which Navajo is unable to transport such volumes of Products will be reduced by an amount equal to: (A) the volume of Products that Navajo was unable to load at the Loading Rack (but not to exceed the Minimum Loading Rack Throughput), as a result of HEP Lovington’s operational difficulties, prorationing or inability to provide sufficient capacity to achieve the Minimum Loading Rack Throughput, multiplied by (B) the Loading Rack Tariff. This Section 2(a)(iii) shall not apply in the event HEP Lovington gives notice of a Force Majeure event in accordance with Section 4, in which case the Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment shall be suspended in accordance with and as provided in Section 4. 

^^Obligations of HEP Lovington. During the Term and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section 11(b), HEP Lovington agrees to: (i) own or lease, operate and maintain the Loading Rack and all related assets necessary to operate the Loading Rack; (ii) provide the services required under this Agreement and perform all operations relating to the Loading Rack; and (iii) maintain adequate property and liability insurance covering the Loading Rack and any related assets owned by HEP and necessary for the operation of the Loading Rack. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, subject to Section 11(b) of this Agreement and Article V of the Omnibus Agreement, HEP Lovington is free to sell any of its assets, including assets that provide services under this Agreement, and Navajo is free to merge with another entity and to sell all of its assets or equity to another entity at any time. 

^^Notification of Utilization. Upon request by HEP Lovington, Navajo will provide to HEP Lovington written notification of Navajo’s reasonable good faith estimate of their anticipated future utilization of the Loading Rack as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving such request. 

^^Scheduling and Accepting Movement. HEP Lovington will use its reasonable commercial efforts to schedule movement and accept movements of Products in a manner that is consistent with the historical dealings between the Parties, as such dealings may change from time to time. 

^^Taxes. Navajo will pay all taxes, import duties, license fees and other charges by any Governmental Authority levied on or with respect to the Products handled by Navajo for loading or unloading by HEP Lovington. Should any Party be required to pay or collect any taxes, duties, charges and or assessments pursuant to any Applicable Law or authority now in effect or hereafter to become effective which are payable by the any other Party pursuant to this Section 2(e) the proper Party shall promptly reimburse the other Party therefor. 

^^Timing of Payments. Navajo will make payments to HEP Lovington by electronic payment with immediately available funds on a monthly basis during the Term with respect to services rendered or reimbursable costs or expenses incurred by HEP Lovington under this Agreement in the prior month. Payments not received by HEP Lovington on or prior to the applicable payment date will accrue interest at the Prime Rate from the applicable payment date until paid. 

\centered Loading Rack Throughput Agreement (Lovington) 

^^^^^ 
^^Increases in Tariff Rates. If new Applicable Laws are enacted that require HEP Lovington to make capital expenditures with respect to the Loading Rack, HEP Lovington may amend the Loading Rack Tariff in order to recover HEP Lovington’s cost of complying with these Applicable Laws (as determined in good faith and including a reasonable return); provided, however, that HEP Lovington may not amend the Loading Rack Tariff pursuant to this Section 2(g) unless and until HEP Lovington has made capital expenditures of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] in the aggregate with respect to the Loading Rack in order to comply with such new Applicable Laws. Navajo and HEP Lovington shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to comply with these Applicable Laws, and shall negotiate in good faith to mitigate the impact of these Applicable Laws and to determine the amount of the new tariff rates. If Navajo and HEP Lovington are unable to agree on the amount of the new tariff rates that HEP Lovington will charge, such tariff rates will be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with Section 11(e). Any applicable exhibit or schedule to this Agreement will be updated, amended or revised, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement to reflect any changes in tariff rates agreed to in accordance with this Section 2(g). 

^^Reimbursement of Operating Expenses. At the end of the first four (4) Contract Quarters following the Closing Date, HEP Lovington shall calculate its aggregate operating expenses incurred in the operation of the Loading Rack (but such calculation shall not include extraordinary and non-recurring items of expense that are not reasonably expected to recur in future periods during the Term). In the event that such aggregate operating expenses exceed the Assumed OPEX, (i) Navajo shall reimburse HEP Lovington for such operating expenses incurred in excess of the Assumed OPEX, and (ii) HEP Lovington shall increase the Loading Rack Tariff by the amount necessary to increase the Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment by an amount equal to such aggregate operating expenses in excess of the Assumed OPEX for the remainder of the Term, and the Parties shall execute an amended, modified, revised or updated Schedule II reflecting such aggregate operating expenses as the new Assumed OPEX. In the event that such aggregate operating expenses are less than the Assumed OPEX, HEP Lovington shall decrease the Loading Rack Tariff by the amount necessary to decrease the Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment by an amount equal to the difference between the Assumed OPEX and such actual operating expenses for the remainder of the Term, and the Parties shall execute an amended, modified, revised or updated Schedule II reflecting such aggregate operating expenses as the new Assumed OPEX. In the event that the PPI increase for any given year is greater than seven percent ([[Percentage 2]]%), then, in addition to any other applicable increases during such year, HEP Lovington shall increase the Loading Rack Tariff by an additional amount necessary to increase the Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment by the OPEX Recovery Amount. Such OPEX Recovery Amount shall be added to the then-current Assumed OPEX, and the Parties shall execute an amended, modified, revised or updated Schedule II reflecting the addition of such OPEX Recovery Amount to the Assumed OPEX. 

^**Agreement to Remain Shipper**  

With respect to any Products that are transported, stored or handled in connection with any of the Loading Rack, Navajo agrees that it will continue acting in the capacity of the shipper of any such Products for its own account at all times that such Products are being transported, stored or handled in such Loading Rack. 

\centered Loading Rack Throughput Agreement (Lovington) 

^^^^^ 
^**Notification of Shut-down or Reconfiguration; Force Majeure** 

^^Navajo must deliver to HEP Lovington at least six months advance written notice of any planned shut down or reconfiguration (excluding planned maintenance turnarounds) of the Refinery or any portion of the Refinery that would reduce the Refinery’s output. Navajo will use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any reduction in revenues or throughput obligations under this Agreement that would result from such a shut down or reconfiguration. If Navajo shuts down or reconfigures the Refinery or any portion of the Refinery (excluding planned maintenance turnarounds) and reasonably believes in good faith that such shut down or reconfiguration will jeopardize its ability to satisfy its Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment under this Agreement, then within 90 days of the delivery of the written notice of the planned shut down or reconfiguration, Navajo shall (i) propose a new Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment under this Agreement such that the ratio of the new Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment under this Agreement over the anticipated production level following the shut down or reconfiguration will be approximately equal to the ratio of the original Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment under this Agreement over the original production level and (ii) propose the date on which the new Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment under this Agreement shall take effect. Unless objected to by HEP Lovington within 60 days of receipt by HEP Lovington of such proposal, such new Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment under this Agreement shall become effective as of the date proposed by Navajo. To the extent that HEP Lovington does not agree with Navajo’s proposal, any changes in Navajo’s obligations under this Agreement, or the date on which such changes will take effect, will be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with Section 13(e). Any applicable exhibit or schedule to this Agreement will be updated, amended or revised, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement to reflect any change in the Minimum Loading Rack Revenue Commitment under this Agreement agreed to in accordance with this Section 4(a). 

^^In the event that any Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by a Force Majeure event from performing its obligations under this Agreement for a period of more than thirty (30) consecutive days, then, upon the delivery of notice and full particulars of the Force Majeure event in writing within a reasonable time after the occurrence of the Force Majeure event relied on (“Force Majeure Notice”), the obligations of the Parties, so far as they are affected by the Force Majeure event, shall be suspended for the duration of any inability so caused. Any suspension of the obligations of the Parties as a result of this Section 4(b) shall extend the Term (to the extent so affected) for a period equivalent to the duration of the inability set forth in the Force Majeure Notice. Navajo will be required to pay any amounts accrued and due under this Agreement at the time of the Force Majeure event. The cause of the Force Majeure event shall so far as possible be remedied with all reasonable dispatch, except that no Party shall be compelled to resolve any strikes, lockouts or other industrial disputes other than as it shall determine to be in its best interests. In the event a Force Majeure event prevents HEP Lovington or Navajo from performing substantially all of their respective obligations under this Agreement for a period of more than one (1) year, this Agreement may be terminated by HEP Lovington or Navajo by providing written notice thereof to the other Party.

^**Right to Enter into a New Agreement** 

^^In the event that Navajo provides prior written notice to HEP Lovington of the desire of Navajo to extend this Agreement by written mutual agreement of the Parties, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to extend this Agreement by written mutual agreement, but, if such negotiations fail to produce a written mutual agreement for extension by a date six months prior to the termination date, then HEP Lovington shall have the right to negotiate to enter into one or more loading agreements with one or more third parties to begin after the date of termination, provided that until the end of one year following termination without renewal of this Agreement, Navajo will have the right to enter into a new loading agreement with HEP Lovington on commercial terms that substantially match the terms upon which HEP Lovington propose to enter into an agreement with a third party for similar services with respect to the Loading Rack. In such circumstances, HEP Lovington shall give Navajo forty-five (45) days prior written notice of any proposed new loading agreement with a third party, and such notice shall inform Navajo of the fee schedules, tariffs, duration and any other terms of the proposed third party agreement and Navajo shall have forty-five (45) days following receipt of such notice to agree to the terms specified in the notice or Navajo shall lose the rights specified by this Section 6(a) with respect to the assets that are the subject of such notice.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder shall be assigned without the prior written consent of Navajo (in the case of any assignment by HEP Lovington) or HEP Lovington (in the case of any assignment by Navajo), in each case, such consent is not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; *provided*, *however*, that (i) HEP Lovington may make such an assignment (including a partial pro rata assignment) to an Affiliate of HEP Lovington without Navajo’s consent, (ii) Navajo may make such an assignment (including a pro rata partial assignment) to an Affiliate of Navajo without HEP Lovington’s consent, (iii) Navajo may make a collateral assignment of their rights and obligations hereunder, and (iv) HEP Lovington may make a collateral assignment of their rights hereunder and/or grant a security interest in all or a portion of the Loading Rack to a bona fide third party lender or debt holder, or trustee or representative for any of them, without Navajo’s consent, if such third party lender, debt holder or trustee shall have executed and delivered to Navajo a non-disturbance agreement in such form as is reasonably satisfactory to Navajo and such third party lender, debt holder or trustee and Navajo executes an acknowledgement of such collateral assignment in such form as may from time to time be reasonably requested. Any attempt to make an assignment otherwise than as permitted by the foregoing shall be null and void. The Parties agree to require their respective successors, if any, to expressly assume, in a form of agreement reasonably acceptable to the other Parties, their obligations under this Agreement. 

^^Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable by a court or regulatory body of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 

^^Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might refer the construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the laws of another state. 

^^Arbitration Provision. Any and all Arbitrable Disputes must be resolved through the use of binding arbitration using three arbitrators, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as supplemented to the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code). If there is any inconsistency between this Section 11(e) and the Commercial Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of this Section 11(e) will control the rights and obligations of the Parties. Arbitration must be initiated within the time limits set forth in this Agreement, or if no such limits apply, then within a reasonable time or the time period allowed by the applicable statute of limitations. Arbitration may be initiated by a Party (“Claimant”) serving written notice on the other Party (“Respondent”) that the Claimant elects to refer the Arbitrable Dispute to binding arbitration. Claimant’s notice initiating binding arbitration must identify the arbitrator Claimant has appointed. The Respondent shall respond to 

\centered Loading Rack Throughput Agreement (Lovington) 

^^^^^ 
Claimant within thirty (30) days after receipt of Claimant’s notice, identifying the arbitrator Respondent has appointed. If the Respondent fails for any reason to name an arbitrator within the 30-day period, Claimant shall petition the American Arbitration Association for appointment of an arbitrator for Respondent’s account. The two arbitrators so chosen shall select a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the second arbitrator has been appointed. The Claimant will pay the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator named by it, and the Respondent will pay the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator named by or for it. The costs of petitioning for the appointment of an arbitrator, if any, shall be paid by Respondent. The Claimant and Respondent will each pay one-half of the compensation and expenses of the third arbitrator. All arbitrators must (i) be neutral parties who have never been officers, directors or employees of any of Navajo, HEP Lovington or any of their Affiliates and (ii) have not less than seven (7) years experience in the petroleum transportation industry. The hearing will be conducted in Dallas, Texas and commence within thirty (30) days after the selection of the third arbitrator. Navajo, HEP Lovington and the arbitrators shall proceed diligently and in good faith in order that the award may be made as promptly as possible. Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the arbitrators will be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties hereto. The arbitrators shall have no right to grant or award indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages of any kind. The Arbitrable Disputes may be arbitrated in a common proceeding along with disputes under other agreements between Navajo, HEP Lovington or their Affiliates to the extent that the issues raised in such disputes are related. Without the written consent of the Parties, no unrelated disputes or third party disputes may be joined to an arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. 

^^Rights of Limited Partners. The provisions of this Agreement are enforceable solely by the Parties, and no limited partner of the Partnership shall have the right, separate and apart from the Partnership, to enforce any provision of this Agreement or to compel any Party to comply with the terms of this Agreement. 

^^Further Assurances. In connection with this Agreement and all transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each signatory Party hereto agrees to execute and deliver such additional documents and instruments and to perform such additional acts as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate, carry out and perform all of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement and all such transactions. 

^^Headings. Headings of the Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever. All references in this Agreement to Sections are to Sections of this Agreement unless otherwise stated.
