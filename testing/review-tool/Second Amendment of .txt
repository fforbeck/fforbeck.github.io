The Warrant Agent will not honor a notice of guaranteed delivery unless a properly completed and executed Warrant Certificate and full paymen t for the Warrant Shares is received by the Warrant Agent by the close of business on the third business day after the Discount Offer Expiration Date.

^^**Number of Warrants Deemed Exercised.** If during the Discount Offer Period a Holder does not indicate the number of Warrant Shares being purchased through the exercise of Warrants, or does not deliver full payment of the Discount Offer Warrant Price for the number of Warrant Shares indicated as being purchased through the exercise of Warrants, then such Holder will be deemed to have exercised Warrants to purchase the maximum number of Warrant Shares determined by dividing (x) the total Discount Offer Warrant Price so paid, by (y) the Discount Offer Warrant Price per Warrant Share; provided, that such number shall not exceed the maximum number of Warrant Shares that may be purchased through the exercise of the Warrant Certificate delivered to the Warrant Agent.
