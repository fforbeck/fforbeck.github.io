$_________________      _____________, 2009

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, APOLLO MEDICAL HOLDINGS, INC. (AMEH.OB), a company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Company"), promises to pay to the order of _________________ or its registered assigns (the "Holder"), the principal sum of ______________ dollars ($___________), with interest from the date hereof at the rate of [[Percentage 1: Number]]% per annum on the unpaid balance hereof until paid.

^**Principal**. If not earlier converted pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof, the principal of this Note shall be payable on [[Date 1: Date]] ("Due Date").

^**Interest**. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of [[Percentage 2: Number]]% per year. Interest (including additional interest, if any) will be paid semi-annually in arrears on [[Date 2: Date]] and [[Date 3: Date]] of each year beginning on [[Date 4: Date]].

Interest will be paid to the person in whose name a note is registered at the close of business on [[Date 5: Date]] and [[Date 6: Date]] as the case may be (whether or not the day is a business day), immediately preceding the relevant interest payment date. Interest on the Notes will be computed on a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and will accrue from the date of the original issuance of the Notes. If any interest payment date falls on a date that is not a business day, such payment of interest (or principal in the case of the final maturity date or any earlier repurchase date for the Notes) will be made on the next succeeding business day, and no interest or other amount will be paid as a result of any such delay. For purposes herein, an "Event of Default" exists if the Company fails to make a payment required by Section 1 or 2 hereof, and such failure is not cured within 10 days following written notice from the Holder.

^**Conversion Events and Mechanics of Conversion**.

^^**Conversion**. The noteholder may convert the principal and unpaid interest to the Company's Common Stock at any time on or before the maturity date.

^^**Mechanics of Conversion**. The Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the Common Stock issuable upon a Conversion Event unless this Note is either delivered to the Company, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company, or the Holder notifies the Company that this Note has been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with this Note. As soon as practicable after delivery of the Note, or delivery of an agreement and indemnification in the case of a lost Note, the Company shall issue and deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled (the "Conversion Shares"), and a check payable to the Holder in the amount equal to the cash amounts payable as a result of a conversion into fractional shares of such preferred stock. Any Conversion Event shall be deemed to have occurred immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Conversion Event, and the Holder entitled to receive the preferred stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such preferred stock on such date.

^^**Conversion Price Adjustment.** At the end of each month during which the principal of the Note is unpaid; the conversion price (CP), subject to being no less than the Floor Price, shall be adjusted to the lesser of:

^^the existing conversion price, or 
^^an adjusted conversion price calculated using the following formula: CP = SP x [[Percentage 3: Number]]%

Where: SP is the average of the monthly high stock price and low stock price as reported by Bloomberg, and Where Floor Price is:

^^$[[USD Value 1: Number]] during the period [[Date 7: Date]] through [[Date 8: Date]] and,

^^After [[Date 8]], the lesser of $[[USD Value 1]] or the greater of either $[[USD Value 2: Number]] per share or 8 times Cash EPS. Cash EPS is defined as Net Cash Provided by or used in Operating Activities minus Depreciation and Amortization divided by fully diluted share shares outstanding as reported on the most recently filed forms 10-Q or 10-K for the previous twelve months. The Note will be considered to outstanding for the purposes of calculating Cash EPS.

The shares of Common Stock underlying the Note will have anti-dilution protection for stock splits, stock dividends, and/or similar transactions.

^^Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of this Note. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the Holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price if the amount is greater than $[[USD Value 1]].

^**Transfer Restrictions**. The Holder shall not transfer the Note or the Conversion Shares (except to its own affiliate, subsidiary, or shareholders) until (a) it has first given written notice to the Company, describing briefly the manner of any such proposed transfer; and (b) (i) the Company has received from counsel satisfactory to the Company an opinion that such transfer can be made without compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and applicable state securities laws, or (ii) a registration statement filed by the Company under the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission and state securities commissions having jurisdiction.

^**Currency; Payments**. All references herein to "dollars" or "$" are to U.S. dollars, and all payments of principal of, and interest on, this Note shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately available funds. If the date on which any such payment is required to be made pursuant to the provisions of this Note occurs on a Saturday or Sunday or legal holiday observed in the State of California, such payments shall be due and payable on the immediately succeeding date which is not a Saturday or Sunday or legal holiday so observed.
