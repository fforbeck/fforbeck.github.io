The obligations of each company under this Agreement shall apply without regard to any amounts of Other Reinsurance which are determined to be uncollectible.

^SUBROGATION  

^^^^^ 
^^The Company hereby agrees to enforce such subrogation rights as it may obtain by virtue of payments made under its policies, but in case it shall refuse or neglect to do so, the Reinsurer is hereby authorized and empowered to bring any appropriate action to enforce such rights. 

^^All subrogation recoveries, other recoveries, salvage or payments made subsequent to the settlement of losses hereunder shall be applied as if made before such settlement and all necessary adjustments to that end shall be made as soon as practicable. 

^^Each company shall have the right, before the happening of an occurrence, to waive its right of subrogation. 

^INSOLVENCY  

In the event of the insolvency of the Company, the reinsurance under this Agreement shall be payable by the Reinsurer on the basis of reported claims allowed in the liquidation proceedings, subject to court approval, without diminution because of the insolvency of the Company. Payments by the Reinsurer shall be made directly to the Company or to its domiciliary liquidator, receiver or statutory successor, except: 

^where the policy specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company, and 

^where the Reinsurer, with the consent of the direct insured or insureds, has assumed such policy obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees. 

The domiciliary liquidator, receiver or statutory successor of an insolvent Company shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of each claim against the insolvent Company on the contract reinsured within a reasonable time after the claim is filed in the liquidation proceeding. During the pendency of the claim, the Reinsurer shall have the right to investigate the claim and interpose in the proceeding where the claim is to be adjudicated, at the Reinsurer’s expense, any defenses that the Reinsurer considers available to the Company, its liquidator, receiver or statutory successor. Subject to court approval, the expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable against the insolvent Company as part of the expense of liquidation, to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer. If two or more assuming insurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose a defense to the claim, the expense must be apportioned as though the expense had been incurred by the Company. 

^ARBITRATION  

As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, any dispute arising out of this Agreement shall be submitted to a board of arbitration composed of three arbiters, one arbiter to 

^^^^^ 
be appointed by each of the parties and the two so appointed shall select the third arbiter. The board shall meet in Boston, Massachusetts, unless otherwise agreed. The claimant shall submit its initial brief within 20 days after the appointment of the last arbiter. The respondent shall submit its brief within 20 days after receipt of the claimant’s brief. The claimant may submit a reply brief within 10 days after receipt of the respondent’s brief. The board shall issue its decision following a hearing in which evidence may be introduced without following strict rules of evidence but in which cross examination and rebuttal shall be allowed. The board shall make its decision having regard for the custom and usage of the property-assuming insurance and reinsurance business and within 60 days after the end of the hearing, unless the parties agree otherwise. A decision by a majority of the board shall be final and binding upon the parties. The board shall not authorize any punitive, exemplary or consequential damages between the parties. Judgment may be entered upon the decision of the board in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear the expenses of its own arbiter and its own legal and expert fees and expenses, and the parties shall equally bear any other expenses of the arbitration proceedings. 

^ERRORS AND OMISSIONS  

Any inadvertent error or omission shall not be held to relieve any party hereto from any liability which would attach to it hereunder if such error or omission had not been made. Any such error or omission shall be rectified as soon as may be reasonably practicable after discovery. 

^REINSURANCE FOLLOWS ORIGINAL POLICIES 

It is the intention of the parties that the fortunes of the policies shall affect the Company and the Reinsurer in every respect; and the Reinsurer’s reinsurance under this Agreement shall be subject to the same terms, rates, conditions, waivers, modifications, alterations and cancellations as the Company’s policies. 

^EXTRA CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  

^^This Agreement shall protect the Company for any “Extra Contractual Obligations,” which constitute those liabilities not covered under any other provision of this Agreement and which arise from the handling of any claim on business covered hereunder. These include, but are not limited to, the following: failure by the Company to settle within the policy limit, or by reason of alleged or actual negligence, bad faith or fraud in rejecting an offer of settlement, or in the preparation of the defense or in the trial of any action against its insured or reinsured or in the preparation or prosecution of an appeal consequent upon such action. 

^^The date on which any Extra Contractual Obligation is incurred by the Company shall be deemed to be the date of the original occurrence giving rise to the loss. 

^CURRENCY  

All transactions under this Agreement shall be made in United States dollars. 

^TERRITORY  

^^^^^ 
The reinsurance provided under this Agreement shall be coextensive with the territory of the policies reinsured hereunder. 

^UNAUTHORIZED REINSURANCE  

^^Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Reinsurer becomes unauthorized in any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia or any other jurisdiction where authorization is required by insurance regulatory authorities in order for the Company to obtain credit on its statutory annual statements for the reinsurance being provided hereunder, the Reinsurer will establish such escrow accounts, trust accounts for the benefit of the Company, letters of credit, funds withheld by the Company, or a combination thereof as required by applicable law or regulation to permit the Company to obtain credit for such reinsurance upon the request of the Company if a penalty would accrue to the Company on its statutory annual statement without such funding. The Reinsurer shall have the option of determining the method of funding to be utilized. 

^^The Reinsurer shall promptly notify the Company of any loss of license or authorization or other change or condition which may affect the ability of the Company to obtain credit for such reinsurance. 

^GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL  

This Agreement is conditional upon obtaining any required approval of applicable governmental insurance regulatory authorities. 

^ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO PROFIT GUARANTEE 

This Agreement represents the entire agreement and understanding among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. No other oral or written agreements or contracts relating to the risks reinsured hereunder currently exist or are contemplated to be legally binding among the parties. This Agreement provides no guarantee of profit, directly or indirectly, from the Reinsurer to the Company or from the Company to the Reinsurer. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument and agreement. 

^^^^^ 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed and delivered by their duly authorized officers, as of the Effective Date.
