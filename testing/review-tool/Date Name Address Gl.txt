\centered **Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement**  

Pursuant to your Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (***“Grant Notice”***) and this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (***“Agreement”***) and in consideration of your services, Conexant Systems, Inc. (the ***“Company”***) has awarded you a Restricted Stock Unit Award (the ***“Award”***) under Section 6(b) of the Conexant Systems, Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the ***“Plan”***) for the number of shares of the Company’s common stock (the “***Stock***”) indicated in the Grant Notice. Your Award is granted to you effective as of the Date of Grant set forth in the Grant Notice for this Award. This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement shall be deemed to be agreed to by the Company and you upon the signing by you of the Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice to which it is attached. Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement but defined in the Plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan. In the event of any conflict between the terms in this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement and the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control. The details of your Award, in addition to those set forth in the Grant Notice and the Plan, are as follows. 

The details of your Award are as follows. 

^**Grant of the Award.** Grant of the Award. This Award represents the right to be issued on a future date the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock as indicated in the Grant Notice. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the “Account”) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Award. This Award was granted in consideration of your services to the Company. Except as otherwise provided herein, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company (other than past and future services to the Company) with respect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the shares or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock. 

^**Date of Issuance.**   

^^The Company will deliver to you a number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock equal to the number of vested shares subject to your Award, including any additional shares received pursuant to Section 5 below that relate to those vested shares on the applicable vesting date(s). However, if a scheduled delivery date falls on a date that is not a business day, such delivery date shall instead fall on the next following business day. The form of such delivery (e.g., a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) shall be determined by the Company. 

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (i) you are subject to the Company’s policy permitting officers and directors to sell shares only during certain “window” periods, in effect from time to time or you are otherwise prohibited from selling shares of the 

\centered 1. 

^^^^^ 
Company’s Common Stock in the public market and any shares in respect of your Award are scheduled to be delivered on a day (the “Original Distribution Date”) that does not occur during an open “window period” applicable to you, as determined by the Company in accordance with such policy, or does not occur on a date when you are otherwise permitted to sell shares of the Company’s Common Stock on the open market, and (ii) the Company elects not to satisfy its tax withholding obligations by withholding shares from your distribution, then such shares shall not be delivered on such Original Distribution Date and shall instead be delivered on the first business day of the next occurring open “window period” applicable to you pursuant to such policy (regardless of whether you are still providing continuous services at such time) or the next business day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of the Company’s Common Stock in the open market, but in no event later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third calendar month of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Original Distribution Date occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the vesting of your Award occurs because of a Change in Control that is a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, in each case for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code and the regulations and other guidance thereunder, then the delivery of the shares shall not be delayed and the shares shall be delivered immediately prior to the Change in Control. The form of such delivery (e.g., a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) shall be determined by the Company. 

^**Vesting**. Subject to the limitations contained herein, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, provided that vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service. Upon such termination of your Continuous Service, the shares credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such termination will be forfeited at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such underlying shares of Common Stock. 

^**Number of Shares**. The number of shares subject to your Award may be adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan. 

^^Any shares, cash or other property that becomes subject to the Award pursuant to this Section 4 and Section 5, if any, shall be subject, in a manner determined by the Board, to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on transferability, and time and manner of delivery as applicable to the other shares covered by your Award. 

^^Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, no fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock shall be created pursuant to this Section 4. The Board shall, in its discretion, determine an equivalent benefit for any fractional shares or fractional shares that might be created by the adjustments referred to in this Section 4. 

^**Dividends.** You shall receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award with respect to any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment as provided in Section 9(a) of the Plan; provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply with respect to any shares of Common Stock that are delivered to you in connection with your Award after such shares have been delivered to you. 

\centered 2. 

^^^^^ 
^**Securities Law Compliance**. You may not be issued any shares of Common Stock under your Award unless either (i) the shares are registered under the Securities Act; or (ii) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 

^**Execution of Documents.** You hereby acknowledge and agree that the manner selected by the Company by which you indicate your consent to your Grant Notice is also deemed to be your execution of your Grant Notice and of this Agreement. You further agree that such manner of indicating consent may be relied upon as your signature for establishing your execution of any documents to be executed in the future in connection with your Award. This Agreement shall be deemed to be signed by the Company and you upon the respective signing by the Company and you of the Grant Notice to which it is attached. 

^**Limitations on Transfer.** Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In addition to any other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities laws, you agree not to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award until the shares are issued to you in accordance with Section 2 of this Agreement. After the shares have been issued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares provided that any such actions are in compliance with the provisions herein and applicable securities laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, you may designate a third party who, in the event of your death, shall thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Common Stock to which you were entitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement. 

^**Award not a Service Contract.**   

^^Your Continuous Service with the Company or an Affiliate is not for any specified term and may be terminated by you or by the Company or an Affiliate at any time, for any reason, with or without cause and with or without notice. Nothing in this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the schedule set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement or the issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement or the Plan shall: (i) confer upon you any right to continue in the employ of, or affiliation with, the Company or an Affiliate; (ii) constitute any promise or commitment by the Company or an Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of future positions, future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or affiliation; (iii) confer any right or benefit under this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued under the terms of this Agreement or Plan; or (iv) deprive the Company of the right to terminate you at will and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that you may have. 

^^By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the Award pursuant to the schedule set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement is 

\centered 3. 

^^^^^ 
earned only by continuing as an employee, director or consultant at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other award or benefit) and that the Company has the right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of its businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to time, as it deems appropriate (a “reorganization”). You further acknowledge and agree that such a reorganization could result in the termination of your Continuous Service, or the termination of Affiliate status of your employer and the loss of benefits available to you under this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, including but not limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting in the Award. You further acknowledge and agree that this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth herein or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in any of them do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an employee or consultant for the term of this Agreement, for any period, or at all, and shall not interfere in any way with your right or the Company’s right to terminate your Continuous Service at any time, with or without cause and with or without notice. 

^**Withholding Obligations.**  

^^On or before the time you receive a distribution of the shares subject to your Award, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, you hereby authorize any required withholding from the Common Stock issuable to you and/or otherwise agree to make adequate provision in cash for any sums required to satisfy the federal, state or local tax withholding obligations of the Company or any Affiliate which arise in connection with your Award (the “Withholding Taxes”). Additionally, the Company may, in its sole discretion, satisfy all or any portion of the Withholding Taxes obligation relating to your Award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) withholding payment from any amounts otherwise payable to you by the Company; (ii) causing you to tender a cash payment; or (iii) withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you in connection with the Award with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the date shares of Common Stock are issued to pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement) equal to the amount of such Withholding Taxes; provided, however, that the number of such shares of Common Stock so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Company’s required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income. 

^^Unless the tax withholding obligations of the Company and/or any Affiliate are satisfied, the Company shall have no obligation to deliver to you any Common Stock. 

^^In the event the Company’s obligation to withhold arises prior to the delivery to you of Common Stock or it is determined after the delivery of Common Stock to you that the amount of the Company’s withholding obligation was greater than the amount withheld by the Company, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any failure by the Company to withhold the proper amount. 

\centered 4. 

^^^^^ 
^**Unsecured Obligation.** Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of a vested Award, you shall be considered an unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Company’s obligation, if any, to issue shares pursuant to this Agreement. You shall not have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement until such shares are issued to you pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement. Upon such issuance, you will obtain full voting and other rights as a stockholder of the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between you and the Company or any other person. 

^**Other Documents**. You hereby acknowledge receipt or the right to receive a document providing the information required by Rule 428(b)(1) promulgated under the Securities Act, which includes the Plan prospectus. In addition, you acknowledge receipt of the Company’s policy permitting officers and directors to sell shares only during certain “window” periods and the Company’s insider trading policy, in effect from time to time. 

^**Notices.** All notices with respect to the Plan shall be in writing and shall be hand delivered or sent by first class mail or reputable overnight delivery service, expenses prepaid. Notice may also be given by electronic mail or facsimile and shall be effective on the date transmitted if confirmed within 24 hours thereafter by a signed original sent in a manner provided in the preceding sentence. Notices to the Company or the Board of Directors shall be delivered or sent to the Company’s headquarters, to the attention of its Chief Financial Officer. Notices to any Participant or holder of shares of Stock issued pursuant to an Award shall be sufficient if delivered or sent to such person’s address as it appears in the regular records of the Company or its transfer agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to participation in the Plan and this Award by electronic means or to request your consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and, if requested, to agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company. 

^**Miscellaneous.**  

^^The rights and obligations of the Company under your Award shall be transferable to any one or more persons or entities, and all covenants and agreements hereunder shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Company’s successors and assigns. Your rights and obligations under your Award may only be assigned with the prior written consent of the Company. 

^^You agree upon request to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or desirable in the sole determination of the Company to carry out the purposes or intent of your Award.

Except as expressly provided herein, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of your Award and those of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall control. 

^**Severability.**  If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid.

The Company expressly reserves its rights to amend, modify, or terminate any of the Company’s or any Affiliate’s employee benefit plans. 

^**Choice of Law.** The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by the law of the state of California without regard to such state’s conflicts of laws rules.
