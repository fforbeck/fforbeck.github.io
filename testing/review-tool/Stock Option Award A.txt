\centered Stock Option Award Agreement 

\centered 2010 Award 

Throughout this Award Agreement we sometimes refer to Sprint Nextel Corporation and its subsidiaries as “we” or “us.” 

^Award of Option Right 

On [[Date 1: Date]] (the “Date of Grant”), the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Sprint Nextel (the “Compensation Committee”) granted you an Option Right to purchase from us shares of Series 1 common stock, par value $[[USD Value 1: Number]] per share of Sprint Nextel (the “Common Stock”) at an Option Price of $ . per share. The Option Right is governed by the terms of the Sprint Nextel Corporation 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) and is subject to the terms and conditions described in this Award Agreement. The Option Right is not intended to qualify as an “incentive stock option” within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”). 

^When the Option Right Becomes Exercisable 

Your Option Right becomes exercisable (or “vested”) on [[Date 2: Date]], or on the date vesting is accelerated as described in paragraph 3 below if earlier (the “Vesting Date”), conditioned upon, as applicable, (a) you continuously serving as our employee through the Vesting Date or (b) in the event of your involuntary termination (not for Cause) or resignation for Good Reason as defined in your [[Date 3: Date]] Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with us as amended on [[Date 4: Date]] (the “Employment Agreement”), your compliance with your restrictive covenants through the Restricted Period as described in your Employment Agreement. Except as provided in clause (b) above or unless vesting of your Option Right accelerates as described in paragraph 3 below, the portion of your Option Right that has not vested as of the date of your termination of employment with us for any reason will be forfeited as of such date. 

^Acceleration of Vesting 

The unvested portion of your Option Right may become vested before the time at which it would normally become vested by the passage of time  that is, the vesting may accelerate. Accelerated vesting can apply in the two circumstances described below. 

***Event***      \centered ***Condition for acceleration***      \centered ***Effective date of acceleration***
Death      If you die      Death

Disability      If you have a termination of employment under circumstances that would make you eligible for benefits under our long-term disability plan      Your Termination Date

Termination Date means the later of (a) the last day of your relationship with us as a common-law employee, and (b) if, after your involuntary termination you receive severance from us paid according to our payroll cycle (i.e., not in a lump sum), the last day of your severance pay period.

^Exercise of Option Right 

To the extent it has vested, you may exercise your Option Right under this Award in whole or in part at the time or times as permitted by the Plan if the Option Right has not otherwise expired, been forfeited or terminated. To exercise you must: 

      deliver a written election under procedures we establish (including by approved electronic medium) and

      pay the Option Price.

You may pay the Option Price by 

      check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds,

      actual or constructive transfer of shares of Common Stock you have owned for at least six months having a market value on the Exercise Date equal to the total Option Price, or

      any combination of cash, shares of Common Stock and other consideration as the Compensation Committee may permit.

If you pay the Option Price by delivery of funds or shares of Common Stock, the value per share for purposes of determining your taxable income from such an exercise will be the Market Value Per Share of the Common Stock on the immediately preceding day before the exercise except that we will use the average of the high and low prices on that date in lieu of the closing price. 

To the extent permitted by law, you may pay the Option Price from the proceeds of a sale through a broker we designate. The Market Value Per Share for purposes of determining your taxable income from such an exercise will be the actual price at which the broker sold the shares. 

^Expiration of Option Right 

Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Award Agreement or the Plan, the Option Right granted herein will expire at 4:00 P.M., U.S. Eastern Time, on the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date (the “Expiration Date”). If the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, however, is a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which the market on which our Common Stock trades is closed (a “Non-Business Day”), then the Expiration Date will occur at 4:00 P.M., U.S. Eastern Time, on the first business day before the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date. 

^Effect of your Termination of Employment 

The length of time you have to exercise your vested Option Right after your termination of employment with us depends on the reason for your termination. The table below describes the post-termination exercise period for the various termination reasons. The Option Right will expire as of the end of the applicable period. In no event, however, may you exercise your Option Right after the Expiration Date.
