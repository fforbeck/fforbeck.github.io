If, upon any request by the Borrower to the Bank to issue a wire transfer, there is an inconsistency between the name of the recipient of the wire and its identification number as specified by the Borrower, the Bank may, without liability, transmit the payment via wire based solely upon the identification number.

If the Borrower fails to keep and maintain such balances, it will pay a deficiency fee, payable within five days after receipt of a statement therefor calculated on the amount by which the Borrower's average daily balances are less than the requirements set forth above, computed at a rate equal to the rate set forth in the Note.

To the Borrower's knowledge, there are no proposed or pending changes in Environmental Laws which would adversely affect the Borrower or its business, and there are no conditions existing currently or likely to exist while the Loan Documents are in effect which would subject the Borrower to Remedial Action or other liability. The Borrower currently complies with and will continue to timely comply with all applicable Environmental Laws; and will provide the Bank, immediately upon receipt, copies of any correspondence, notice, complaint, order or other document from any source asserting or alleging any circumstance or condition which requires or may require a financial contribution by the Borrower or Remedial Action or other response by or on the part of the Borrower under Environmental Laws, or which seeks damages or civil, criminal or punitive penalties from the Borrower for an alleged violation of Environmental Laws.

FOR VALUE RECEIVED.the undersigned borrower (the **"Borrower"),** promises to pay to the order of **U.S. BANK N.A.**

**Interest.**  
The unpaid principal balance will bear interest at an annual rate of [[Percentage 1: Number]]%.

**Payment Schedule.**  
Principal and interest are payable in 52 installments of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] each, beginning MAY 15, 2010, and on the same date of each consecutive month thereafter (except that if a given month does not have such a date, the last day of such month), plus a final payment equal to all unpaid principal and accrued interest on SEPTEMBER 15, 2014, the maturity date.

Interest will be computed for the actual number of days principal is unpaid, using a daily factor obtained by dividing the stated interest rate by 360. 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Note to the contrary, upon any default or at any time during the continuation thereof (including failure to pay upon maturity), the Bank may, at its option and subject to applicable law, increase the interest rate on this Note to a rate of [[Percentage 2: Number]]% per annum plus the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to applicable law, upon the occurrence of a default by the Borrower or any guarantor involving bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership proceedings or an assignment for the benefit of creditors, the interest rate on this Note shall automatically increase to a rate of [[Percentage 2]]% per annum plus the rate otherwise payable hereunder.

In no event will the interest rate hereunder exceed that permitted by applicable law. If any interest or other charge is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum amount permitted by law, the interest or charge shall be reduced to the maximum permitted by law, and the Bank may credit any excess amount previously collected against the balance due or refund the amount to the Borrower.

Subject to applicable law, if any payment is not made on or before its due date, the Bank may collect a delinquency charge of [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the unpaid amount. Collection of the late payment fee shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the Bank's right to declare a default hereunder.

Without affecting the liability of any Borrower, endorser, surety or guarantor, the Bank may, without notice, renew or extend the time for payment, accept partial payments, release or impair any collateral security for the payment of this Note, or agree not to sue any party liable on it.
