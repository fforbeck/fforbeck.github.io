Borrower acknowledges that no such acceptance or grace granted by Lender or its agents in the past, or Lender’s agreement to the modifications evidenced hereby, has in any manner diminished Lender’s right in the future to insist that Borrower strictly comply with the terms of the Loan Documents, as modified by the terms hereof. Furthermore, Borrower specifically acknowledges that any future grace or forgiveness of Events of Default shall not constitute a waiver or diminishment of any right of Lender with respect to any future Event of Default of Borrower, whether or not similar to any Event of Default with respect to which Lender has in the past chosen, or may in the future choose, not to exercise all of the rights and remedies granted to it under the Loan Documents. 

^*No Modification*. This Agreement supersedes and merges all prior and contemporaneous promises and agreements. No modification of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any waiver of rights under any of the foregoing, shall be effective unless made by supplemental agreement, in writing, executed by Lender and Borrower.

^^Except as specifically amended above the Loan Agreement and the Note, and all other instruments securing or guaranteeing Borrower’s obligations to Lender (the “Security Documents”) shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed.

^^The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of Lender under any of the Security Documents, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of any of the Security Documents. 

^*Waiver*. Borrower acknowledges that the execution of this Agreement by Lender is not intended nor shall it be construed as (i) an actual or implied waiver of any Event of Default under the Loan Documents or (ii) an actual or implied waiver of any condition or obligation imposed upon Borrower pursuant to the Loan Documents, except to the extent expressly set forth herein. 

^*Expenses.* Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, Borrower shall pay, or cause to be paid, all costs and expenses incident to the preparation hereof and the consummation of the transactions specified herein, including without limitation title insurance policy endorsement charges, recording fees and fees and expenses of legal counsel to Lender.

^*Bankruptcy.* In consideration for the forbearance of Lender in exercising its remedies under the Loan Documents and in consideration for the modification of the Loan Documents as provided in this Agreement, Borrower agrees that, in the event Borrower files a petition for relief under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other present or future federal or state insolvency, bankruptcy or similar law (all of the foregoing hereinafter collectively called “applicable Bankruptcy Law”) or an involuntary petition for relief is filed against Borrower under any applicable Bankruptcy Law, or an order for relief naming Borrower is entered under any applicable Bankruptcy Law, or any composition, rearrangement, extension, reorganization or other relief of debtors now or hereafter existing is requested or consented to by Borrower, then Lender shall thereupon be entitled to immediate and absolute relief from any automatic stay imposed by Section 362 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, or any other applicable Bankruptcy Law, on or against the exercise of the rights and remedies otherwise available to Lender under the Loan Documents (including but not limited to foreclosure) and/or at law or equity, and Borrower irrevocably waives its right to object to such relief from automatic stay and agrees not to oppose Lender’s motion to obtain such relief, and further agrees that this Agreement constitutes “cause” to lift the automatic stay pursuant to Section 362(d) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. 

^*Counterparts.* This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if all parties hereto had signed the same document. All such counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one instrument, but in making proof hereof it shall only be necessary to produce one such counterpart. 

^*Severability.* If any covenant, condition, or provision herein contained is held to be invalid by final judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such covenant, condition, or provision shall not in any way affect any other covenant, condition or provision herein contained. 

^*Time is of the Essence.* It is expressly agreed by the parties hereto that time is of the essence with respect to this Agreement. 

^*Construction.* The parties acknowledge and confirm that each of their respective attorneys have participated jointly in the review and revision of this Agreement and that it has not been written solely by counsel for one party. The parties hereto therefore stipulate and agree that the rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to or may be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement to favor either party against the other. 

^*Applicable Law*. This Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties hereunder shall be governed for all purposes by the law of the State of Texas and the law of the United States applicable to transactions within said State. 

^*Successors.* The terms and provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their successors and assigns. 

^*Dispute Resolution.* This section replaces all agreements to arbitrate claims and jury waiver provisions within the Loan Documents and contains a jury waiver, arbitration clause, and a class action waiver. READ IT CAREFULLY. 

^^JURY TRIAL WAIVER. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY WAIVES THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BEFORE A JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE (AS HEREINAFTER DEFINED), AND DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY. IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT THIS PROVISION IS NOT ENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON AND AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO TRIAL OF THE DISPUTE, BUT NOT LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER ENTRY OF THE ORDER DETERMINING THIS PROVISION IS UNENFORCEABLE, ANY PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO MOVE THE COURT FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING ARBITRATION AND STAYING OR DISMISSING SUCH LITIGATION PENDING ARBITRATION (“ARBITRATION ORDER”). 

^^Arbitration. 

^^^If a claim, dispute, or controversy arises between us with respect to this Agreement, related agreements, or any other agreement or business relationship between any of us whether or not related to the subject matter of this Agreement (all of the foregoing, a “Dispute”), and only if a jury trial waiver is not permitted by applicable law or ruling by a court, any of us may require that the Dispute be resolved by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator at the request of any party. By agreeing to arbitrate a Dispute, each party gives up any right that party may have to a jury trial, as well as other rights that party would have in court that are not available or are more limited in arbitration, such as the rights to discovery and to appeal. 

^^^Arbitration shall be commenced by filing a petition with, and in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules of, JAMS or National Arbitration Forum (“Administrator”) as selected by the initiating party. If the parties agree, arbitration may be commenced by appointment of a licensed attorney who is selected by the parties and who agrees to conduct the arbitration without an Administrator. Disputes include matters (A) relating to a deposit account, application for or denial of credit, enforcement of any of the obligations we have to each other, compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, performance or services provided under any agreement by any party, (B) based on or arising from an alleged tort, or (C) involving either of our employees, agents, affiliates, or assigns of a party. However, Disputes do not include the validity, enforceability, meaning, or scope of this arbitration provision and such matters may be determined only by a court. If a third party is a party to a Dispute, we each will consent to including the third party in the arbitration proceeding for resolving the Dispute with the third party. Venue for the arbitration proceeding shall be at a location determined by mutual agreement of the parties or, if no agreement, in the city and state where lender or bank is headquartered. 

^^^After entry of an Arbitration Order, the non-moving party shall commence arbitration. The moving party shall, at its discretion, also be entitled to commence arbitration but is under no obligation to do so, and the moving party shall not in any way be adversely prejudiced by electing not to commence arbitration. The arbitrator: (A) will hear and rule on appropriate dispositive motions for judgment on the pleadings, for failure to state a claim, or for full or partial summary judgment; (B) will render a decision and any award applying applicable law; (C) will give effect to any limitations period in determining any Dispute or defense; (D) shall enforce the doctrines of compulsory counterclaim, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, if applicable; (E) with regard to motions and the arbitration hearing, shall apply rules of evidence governing civil cases; and (F) will apply the law of the state specified in the agreement giving rise to the Dispute. Filing of a petition for arbitration shall not prevent any party from (G) seeking and obtaining from a court of competent jurisdiction (notwithstanding ongoing arbitration) provisional or ancillary remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, property preservation orders, foreclosure, eviction, attachment, replevin, garnishment, and/or the appointment of a receiver, (H) pursuing non-judicial foreclosure, or (I) availing itself of any self-help remedies such as setoff and repossession. The exercise of such rights shall not constitute a waiver of the right to submit any Dispute to arbitration. 

^^^Judgment upon an arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction except that, if the arbitration award exceeds $[[USD Value 11: Number]] any party shall be entitled to a de novo appeal of the award before a panel of three arbitrators. To allow for such appeal, if the award (including Administrator, arbitrator, and attorney’s fees and costs) exceeds $[[USD Value 11]] the arbitrator will issue a written, reasoned decision supporting the award, including a statement of authority and its application to the Dispute. A request for de novo appeal must be filed with the arbitrator within 30 days following the date of the arbitration award; if such a request is not made within that time period, the arbitration decision shall become final and binding. On appeal, the arbitrators shall review the award de novo, meaning that they shall reach their own findings of fact and conclusions of law rather than deferring in any manner to the original arbitrator. Appeal of an arbitration award shall be pursuant to the rules of the Administrator or, if the Administrator has no such rules, then the JAMS arbitration appellate rules shall apply. 

^^Arbitration under this provision concerns a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. This arbitration provision shall survive any termination, amendment, or expiration of this Agreement. If the terms of this provision vary from the Administrator’s rules, this arbitration provision shall control. 

^^CLASS ACTION WAIVER. EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE IN COURT OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE AS A CLASS ACTION, EITHER AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OR AS A REPRESENTATIVE, OR TO ACT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 

^^Reliance. Each party (i) certifies that no one has represented to such party that the other party would not seek to enforce jury and class action waivers in the event of suit, and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other party have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers, agreements, and certifications in this section. 

^*Notice and Agreement.* Borrower and Lender take notice of and agree to the following: 

^^PURSUANT TO SUBSECTION 26.02(b) OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, A LOAN AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE AMOUNT INVOLVED THEREIN EXCEEDS $[[USD Value 12: Number]] IN VALUE IS NOT ENFORCEABLE UNLESS THE AGREEMENT IS IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY THE PARTY TO BE BOUND OR BY THAT PARTY’S AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE. 

^^PURSUANT TO SUBSECTION 26.02(c) OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE DETERMINED SOLELY FROM THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, AND ANY PRIOR ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARE SUPERSEDED BY AND MERGED INTO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS. 

^^THE LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THIS AGREEMENT REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES THERETO AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES THERETO. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
