^^^In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, unless such amounts are not paid on such date fixed for payment, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until such amount is paid in full.

^^Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

^^Mechanics of Conversion.

^^^In order for a holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent of such certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the time of conversion (the “**Conversion Time**”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, but in no event later than the fifth business day after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.

^^^The Corporation shall at all times when the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the applicable Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

^^^All shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and the rights attendant to such shares of Common Stock, such amounts shall be paid in full by the Corporation at the Conversion Time. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock accordingly.

^^^Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion, provided, that the holder of such Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive any such dividends.

^^The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

^^Definitions. For purposes of this Section 4, the following definitions shall apply:

^^^“**Original Issue Date**” shall mean the Series A Original Issue Date or the Series B Original Issue Date, as applicable.

^^^“**Series A Original Issue Date**” shall mean the date on which the first share of Series A Preferred Stock is issued.

^^^“**Series B Original Issue Date**” shall mean the date on which the first share of Series B Preferred Stock is issued.

^^Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, or combine the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock without a comparable combination of the Common Stock, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that subdivision or combination shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable combination of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

^^Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such dividend or other distribution by a fraction:

^^^the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date, and

^^^the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price for such series of 

Preferred stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of such series of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares of such series of Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of additional shares of Common Stock being issued with respect to each share of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution.

^^Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions of Subsection 2(b), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by Subsections (e) or (f) of this Section 4), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation after the exercise of due care) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Series A Conversion Price and Series B Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock.

^^Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (i) the Series A Conversion Price and Series B Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock.

^^^Notice of Record Date. In the event:

^^^the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series 

^Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other right; or

^^^of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

^^^of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such exchange applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent at least fifteen (15) days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice. Any notice required by the provisions hereof to be given to a holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed sent to such holder if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to such holder at his, her or its address appearing on the books of the Corporation.

^Mandatory Conversion.

^^Upon the earlier of (x) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to an underwritten public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $[[USD Value 1: Number]] of gross proceeds to the Corporation or any selling shareholders, or (y) any date specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least 66 2/[[Percentage 2]]% of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the “**Mandatory Conversion Date**”), (i) all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective Series A Conversion Ratio or Series B Conversion Ratio, as applicable, and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation as shares of such series.

^^All holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be given written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be given in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such notice shall be sent by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, or given by electronic communication in compliance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law, to each record holder of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. Promptly after receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed to be outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock has been converted. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in Subsection 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

^^All certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. Such converted Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock may not be reissued as shares of such Series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock accordingly.

^Optional Redemption of Series C Preferred Stock.

^^Redemption.

^^^Request by Holders of Series C Preferred Stock. The holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall have the right to cause the Corporation, at any time, and from time to time after [[Date 2: Date]], in each case upon the demand of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, to redeem from each such holder on the date of such request all of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by such holder, at a price per share equal to the Series C Redemption Price, provided that, (x) any such rights to seek redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be subject to any limitations contained in the Credit Facility or any Subsequent Indebtedness, and (y) in no event shall the Corporation be required to redeem any shares of Series C Preferred Stock to the extent such shares of Series C Preferred Stock are then subject to a pending indemnification claim under Article 12 of the Stock Purchase Agreement.

^^^Company Right to Redeem. The Corporation shall have the right, at any time, to redeem some or all of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, at a price per share equal to the Series C Redemption Price.

^^^If the Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem, or is otherwise restricted from redeeming, all shares of Series C Preferred Stock (to the extent the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock have so requested such redemption in accordance with Subsection 6(a)(i) above) outstanding on the date on which such redemption is scheduled to occur, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s shares of Series C Preferred Stock out of funds legally available therefor, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the legally available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor or the applicable restriction is lifted. In the event that the Corporation fails to redeem shares for which redemption is requested and required pursuant to this Section 6(a) for any reason on the applicable date, until the Redemption Price is paid in full for all shares requested to be redeemed, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock which the holders thereof have requested be redeemed in accordance with this Section 6 shall continue to be entitled to Accrued Dividends as provided in Subsections 1(c)(1)(b) and above until such shares are so redeemed.

^^Redemption Notices.

^^^Redemption Notice by the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation shall elect to redeem and pay all or part of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall provide written notice of such redemption pursuant to this Section 6(b)(i) specifying the time and place of redemption, by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each holder Series C Preferred Stock at the address for such holder last shown on the records of the Corporation, not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the date on which such redemption is to be made. If less than all the shares of Series C Preferred Stock owned by to such holder are then to be redeemed, the notice will also specify the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock which are to be redeemed.

^^^Redemption and Payment Notice by the Holders of Series C Preferred Stock. In the event that the majority of holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall elect to redeem all of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Such holders shall provide written notice of such redemption election pursuant to this Section 6(b)(ii) to the Corporation no less that 30 days prior to the holders’ desired redemption date.

^^Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Any shares of Series C Preferred Stock which are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries shall be automatically and immediately canceled and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred. Neither the Corporation nor any of its Subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other rights granted to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock following redemption.

^^Restrictions. At any time after delivery of written notice by any holders of Series C Preferred Stock of the exercise of their redemption rights hereunder and until the full amount of the Redemption Price shall have been paid to such holders with respect to any shares of Series C Preferred Stock they shall have elected to have redeemed (a “**Pending Redemption Period**”), the Corporation shall not (i) pay any extraordinary bonus compensation to any of its officers, directors or employees, (ii) declare any dividend or make any distribution on its shares of capital stock or (iii) redeem or repurchase any other securities of the Corporation.
