Page 11

^^In the event that other minerals not referred to in the Exploration License are discovered in the course of the Exploration Activities, either (i) Al Zuhra LLC if the discovery occurs before APM has earned a [[Percentage 5]]% Participating Interest in Al Zuhra LLC, or (ii) the Parties acting jointly if the discovery occurs after APM has earned a [[Percentage 5]]% Participating Interest in Al Zuhra LLC, may make application to the MCI to acquire rights to develop such minerals, which will be incorporated into this Agreement by way of an addendum thereto.

^^All amounts contributed by APM towards Expenditure and development funding shall be regarded as loans to APM (the "APM Loans"), and shall be borne entirely by APM and/or its Affiliates. It is agreed that the APM Loans will be repaid to APM in full from any profits generated by Al Zuhra LLC before the payment of any dividends / profits to the Shareholders.

^^It is agreed that an internationally recognised independent consulting firm (for example SRK Consulting) will be appointed by APM for the preparation and completion of the BFS, and APM undertakes to consult with the Promoter prior to making such appointment. 

^^Subject to the provisions of Article 154 of the Commercial Companies Law (which requires ten percent ([[Percentage 6: Number]]%) of the Company's profits to be set aside as a legal reserve until the reserve is equal to one third of the Company's capital), and subject further to the provisions of Clause 2.6, the Shareholders will distribute the profits of Al Zuhra LLC in accordance with the Commercial Companies Law (CCL):

^FUNDING AFTER COMPLETION OF THE BFS

^^For the avoidance of doubt, it is specifically recorded that the Promoter and Qannas shall not be required to contribute any debt or equity funding to Al Zuhra LLC prior to completion of the BFS. 

^^After the BFS Date, the Promoter agrees to transfer to APM the Reserved Shares for a consideration of one Rial only such that APM holds [[Percentage 2]]% Participating Interest in Al Zuhra LLC. The Promoter acknowledges that the price of one Rial for the Reserved Shares is reasonable adequate and is justified in view of the terms of this Agreement. The Promoter will take all steps and cause the other Shareholders and Al Zuhra LLC to take all such steps and actions as may be required to give effect to the provisions of this clause 3, including, in particular those set out in clause 2.1.4.

^^The Promoter will not be required to contribute any equity funding after the BFS Date for the development of Block 6. However, if APM provides any funding to Al Zuhra LLC, such funding will be considered as a loan to Al Zuhra LLC and will be repaid to APM in full, together with APM's contributions towards Expenditure, before any dividends may be distributed to the Parties. 

^^The Promoter and Qannas represent and warrant that the Shares held by them are fully paid up and free of any Encumbrance and undertake that they will not increase the Share capital of Al Zuhra LLC without the prior written consent of APM.

Page 13

^^All Parties agree to work together to source debt funding for the Project, including for the purposes of building and operating Block 6 on mutually beneficial terms to Al Zuhra LLC and as acceptable to APM.

^^Upon completion of the BFS, APM shall use its best commercial endeavours to raise any equity funding that may be required by Al Zuhra LLC to commission a mine on the Exploration Area without cost to the Promoter. All borrowings are to be mutually agreed by the Shareholders and APM.

^^Although the Promoter is not required to contribute any equity funding to Al Zuhra LLC, the Promoter acknowledges and agrees that in the event that a third party provides debt funding to Al Zuhra LLC, it is likely that such third party would require security to be in place over the entire Project. The Promoter and APM agree not to unreasonably withhold its consent on creation of any such security that may be required by the third party lender, and further acknowledge and agree that such security may, as is ordinarily the case, take the form of an Encumbrance over any of Al Zuhra LLC's direct or indirect assets, including but not limited to the Exploration License or Mining License as the case may be. As per clause 3.5 all borrowings are to be mutually agreed by the Shareholders and APM.

^^APM undertakes to use its best commercial endeavours to source equity and debt funding for Al Zuhra LLC within 6 (six) months from the BFS Date, such that development work on the Exploration Area can commence within 18 (eighteen) months of the receipt of such funding. 

^^In the event that the BFS yields negative results, such that in the opinion of the internationally recognised independent consulting firm, the Minerals cannot be economically exploited, APM shall, subject to the provisions of clause 9 hereof, be entitled to withdraw from the Project, APM shall not be entitled to institute any claim against the Promoter or Al Zuhra LLC of any nature whatsoever. 

^OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT:

The Parties acknowledge and agree that APM is entering into this Agreement on the basis and understanding that the Promoter and other Shareholder has accorded its consent to APM to directly or indirectly acquire an interest in mining blocks, under Article 8 of the CCL.

^WITHDRAWAL BY APM:

^^APM shall be entitled to withdraw from Al Zuhra LLC immediately upon completion of any annual Exploration Program by providing Al Zuhra LLC and the Promoter with written notification thereof if, in its sole opinion, the Block 6 Project does not warrant any further work. In such an event, all costs and expenses incurred by APM prior to the BFS Date shall be borne by APM, and APM will not be entitled to make any claim against the Promoter or Al Zuhra LLC for these expenses incurred. Further, if APM withdraws from the Project at any time prior to the completion of the airborne survey and pilot drilling, APM will transfer the Shares held by it to the Promoter for a consideration of one Rial only.

If APM has acquired any Shares at this time, it agrees to transfer the Shares held by it to the Promoter for a consideration of One Rial only. Al Zuhra LLC agrees to pay and the Promoter agrees to cause Al Zuhra LLC to pay the [[Percentage 3]]% Net Smelter Return Royalty to APM. The repayment of the Expenditure by way of the [[Percentage 3]]% Net Smelter Return Royalty will constitute the repayment of the APM Loan as provided in clause 2.3 above. It is agreed that in the event that APM withdraws from Al Zuhra LLC pursuant to the p rovisions of this clause 9, APM shall not be entitled to institute any monetary claim against any other Party to this Agreement, provided it continues to receive the [[Percentage 3]]% Net Smelter Return Royalty from Al Zuhra LLC. APM would be entitled to audit the books and records of Al Zuhra LLC to ensure the payment of the Net Smelter Return Royalty.
