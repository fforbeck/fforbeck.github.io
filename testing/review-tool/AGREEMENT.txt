To the extent permitted by law, such Inventions shall be “works for hire,” whether or not developed or conceived during regular working hours or at the Company’s facilities. HETI will assist the Company to obtain, perfect, sustain and enforce the Company’s rights in and ownership of the Inventions, including without limitation executing patent assignments and additional instruments of conveyance.

^Term. This Agreement shall remain in effect for four (4) months from the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”), and shall automatically renew for successive six (6) month terms, until such time this agreement is terminated in writing by either party upon two (2) weeks written notice to the other party prior the end of the then current term.
