^^In furtherance of the foregoing, the indemnification procedures set forth in Section 5.06 of the Original Contribution Agreement shall apply to any Third Party Claim arising out of this Agreement, other than claims described in Sections 6.02 and 6.03. 

SECTION 6.02.  Company Claims.  

^^The Company shall indemnify RN Parent and its Affiliates, MTVN Parent and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (each, an “Indemnified Party”) against, and hold them free and harmless from, any and all Losses arising from or relating to (i) any failure by the Company to perform or fulfill any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, including without limitation with respect to any of the MTVN Contributions, RN Contributions or RN Included Liabilities, (ii) the Rhapsody Service, or (iii) those claims set forth on Schedule 7, in each case, arising prior to, on or after the date hereof (each, a “Company Indemnified Claim”); provided, that the Company shall not be required to indemnify an Indemnified Party against any claim arising out of the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Party 

^^^^^ 
and; provided further, that any Losses arising solely out of or relating to any breach of Section 3.01(e) hereof shall not be deemed Company Indemnified Claims. If and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking may be unavailable or unenforceable for any reason, the Company will make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Company Indemnified Claims which is permissible under applicable law. The rights of any Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder will be in addition to any other rights any such party may have under any other agreement or instrument referenced above or any other agreement or instrument to which such Indemnified Party is or becomes a party or is or otherwise becomes a beneficiary under Law. 

^^The Company shall control the defense of any Company Indemnified Claim (except claims set forth on Schedule 7 for which RN Parent shall control the defense, provided, the Company shall be entitled, at its option, to control the defense of any such claim upon notification to RN Parent of such election), provided, however, if at any time, in the reasonable opinion of an Indemnified Party, notice of which shall be given in writing to the Company, (i) the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interests between the Company and the Indemnified Party with respect to the Company Indemnified Claim, or (ii) upon petition by the Indemnified Party, a court rules that the Company failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right in its sole discretion to control or assume (as the case may be) the defense of any such Company Indemnified Claim and the amount of any judgment or settlement and the reasonable costs and expenses of defense shall be included as part of the indemnification obligations of the Company hereunder. If the Indemnified Party should elect to exercise such right, the Company shall have the right to monitor and participate in, but not control, the defense of such Company Indemnified Claim or claim set forth on Schedule 7, as applicable, at the sole cost and expense of the Company. In the event that the Indemnified Party exercises its right to control the defense of a claim set forth on Schedule 7, any Litigation Costs (as defined below) incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such claim shall be included in the Losses indemnified by the Company pursuant to Section 6.02(a) The Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Company Indemnified Claim, irrespective of whether it controls or has assumed the defense of such claim, without the Company’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the Indemnified Party may elect to control the defense of any Company Indemnified Claim not included in clauses (i) and (ii) above, it being understood that the Indemnified Party shall thereby relinquish any right to seek indemnification hereunder.

The 

^^^^^ 
parties shall negotiate in good faith to enter into an agreement providing for the allocation of Losses (excluding Litigation Costs) associated with such claims based on the relative responsibility assigned to each party by the applicable court or tribunal presiding over such claims (an “Allocation Agreement”). Each of RN Parent and the Company hereby agrees that it shall pay for any Litigation Costs so allocated, and that each of the Company and RN Parent shall have the right to enforce such obligation in a court of law. The parties agree that the applicable RN Party shall control the defense of the matters set forth on Schedule 8, provided, that the Company shall be entitled, at its option, to control the defense of any such claim or a portion thereof (to the extent such claim or a portion thereof relates solely to the Company and not to an RN Party) upon notification to RN Parent of such election. If the Company exercises its option to control the defense of any claim set forth on Schedule 8 or portion thereof pursuant to the preceding sentence, then (i) the Company shall bear the Litigation Costs associated with such defense, and RN Parent shall bear the Litigation Costs associated with the portion of such claim of which RN Parent controls the defense (if any), in each case, without regard to the Allocation Agreement (if any), and (ii) any Losses arising out of such claim shall be borne by RN Parent and the Company, respectively, based on the ruling of the applicable court or tribunal. Each of the Company and RN Parent hereby waives any claim or defense that any conflict of interests exists between the Company and RN Parent or any RN Party with respect to the matters set forth on Schedule 8, and further consents to and authorizes RN Parent’s engagement of outside and internal counsel (collectively, “RN Counsel”) to represent both RN Parent and the Company in connection with such claims for which RN Party controls the defense, and further agrees to execute any agreement necessary to secure engagement of counsel or otherwise facilitate the joint representation described herein. Each of the Company and RN Parent also agrees that it will not, for itself or any other entity or person, assert that either (a) RN Counsel’s representation of the Company in any matter set forth on Schedule 8 or (b) RN Parent’s actual, or possible, possession of confidential information belonging to the Company or any affiliate is a basis to disqualify RN Counsel from representing the Company in connection with the matters set forth on Schedule 8. The Company and RN Parent agree that in the event that the Company and RN Parent share or disclose to one another any confidential or privileged information in connection with the defense of the matters set forth on Schedule 8, such disclosure shall be made subject to joint defense and/or common interest privileges and accordingly shall not result in a waiver of any applicable rules of privilege and confidentiality vis-à-vis potentially adverse parties. It is the intention and understanding of each of the Company and RN Parent that (x) the fact that particular communications may be made between them relating to the matters set forth on Schedule 8, (y) the contents of such communications and (z) any part of memoranda or other work product containing or referring to such communications shall remain confidential and protected from disclosure to any third party. 

^^With respect to any claim which may arise from or relate to, in whole or in part, products of any MTVN Parent, any of its Affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (each, a “MTVN Party”) or RN Party or services of a MTVN Party or RN Party that are not among the MTVN Contributions, RN Contributions or the RN Contributed Assets or MTVN Contributed Assets (each, as defined in the Original Contribution Agreement) (excluding 

^^^^^ 
any claim otherwise indemnified under Sections 6.02 and 6.03(a)), the parties shall negotiate in good faith to enter into an agreement within twenty (20) Business Days of the date upon which such claim is made known to MTVN Party, RN Party or the Company, which shall provide for (a) the allocation of costs associated with such claim and (b) the management of any litigation arising out of such claim. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing in this Article VI or any other Transaction Agreement shall in any way affect or apply to any of the pending litigation matters set forth on Schedule 9 hereto. 

SECTION 6.04.  Indemnification Procedures. With respect to any claim described in Sections 6.02 and 6.03, in order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving any claim, such Indemnified Party must notify the Company in writing (and in reasonable detail) of the claim within a reasonable time after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the claim;  provided,  however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder unless the Company shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. After providing notice to the Company, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Company, within a reasonable time after the Indemnified Party’s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the claim. The provisions of this Section 6.04 shall not apply to any claim for indemnification made under Section 6.01. 

SECTION 6.05.  Cooperation. If the Company defends or prosecutes a claim, all Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Company’s request) the provision to the Company of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder;  provided, that in connection with any claim arising out of Section 6.03, including any claim set forth on Schedule 8, in the event that the Company assumes the defense or a portion thereof, RN Parent and MTVN Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, transfer any information relevant to such defense to the Company as promptly as practicable after the Company’s delivery of notice to RN Parent or MTVN Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, of its intent to assume the defense of the claim; and  provided further, that at the request of either RN Parent or MTVN Parent, the parties agree that prior to exchanging any information that has been reasonably determined to be privileged information by RN Parent or MTVN Parent, the parties shall agree to discuss in good faith the appropriateness of entering into a joint defense and cooperation agreement with respect to such information but the Company shall not be obligated to enter into any such joint defense agreement.
