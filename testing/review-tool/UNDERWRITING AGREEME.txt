^^the Company has been duly incorporated and is good standing under the laws of State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as described in the Prospectuses;

^^as of the Closing Date,  Common Shares and no shares of preferred stock, US$[[USD Value 2]] par value, were issued and outstanding. The outstanding Common Shares have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;

^^the form of the certificate used to evidence the Common Shares has been approved by the directors of the Company and complies with all applicable requirements of the Company’s constating documents and the Delaware General Corporation Law;

^^the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities, will not (i) conflict with the constating documents of the Company, (ii) constitute a violation of, or a breach or default under, any indenture, mortgage, note, contract, agreement, instrument, lease or other document set forth in Schedule A to such counsel’s opinion, or (iii) violate or conflict with, or result in the contravention of, (A) the Delaware General Corporation Law and those federal laws, rules and regulations of the United States of America, in each case that, in such counsel’s experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, or (B) any court or administrative order to which the Company is a named party and known to such counsel;

^^the Registration Statement is effective under the U.S. Securities Act, and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof has been issued and, to such counsel’s knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the SEC;

^^the Registration Statement, at the time of its most recent effective date, and the U.S. Final Prospectus, as of its date, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and SEC Rules and Regulations (other than the financial statements and other financial information, and the information included in or derived from reports of, or attributed to, persons named in

the U.S Final Prospectus under the heading “Interest of Experts”, as to which such counsel need express no opinion);

^^the statements in the Prospectuses under the heading “Description of Securities”, insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Common Shares, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects;

^^although the discussion set forth in the Prospectuses under the caption “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders” does not address all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Common Shares by non-U.S. Holders (as defined in the Prospectuses) who acquire Common Shares pursuant to the Offering, such discussion constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States federal income tax considerations that are anticipated to be material to such non-U.S. Holders, subject to the qualifications set forth therein;

^^the statements set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended [[Date 5]] under the caption “Business  Government Regulation of Mining-Related Activities, Property Instruments and Mining Claims”, insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws referred to therein, are fair summaries of the matters referred to therein;

^^the Company is not and, after giving effect to the Offering and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectuses, will not be an “investment company” as such term is defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;

^^no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing, registration or qualification with, any Governmental Authority, which has not been obtained, taken or made (other than as required by any state securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) is required under any Applicable Law for the issuance or sale of the Offered Securities or the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement. For purposes hereof, the term “Governmental Authority” means any executive, legislative, judicial, administrative or regulatory body of the State of Delaware or the United States of America, and the term “Applicable Law” means the general Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States of America (including the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant thereto) that a lawyer exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably be expected to recognize as being applicable to the Company and the agreements related to the Offering. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition of Applicable Law, the term “Applicable Law” does not include any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company or the agreements related to the Offering solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the agreements related to the Offering or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate;

^^the choice of Ontario law as the law governing this Agreement is a permissible choice of law under the laws of the State of Delaware, and in an action properly brought before a Delaware state court or a United States federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, such court would recognize and give effect to the provision of this Agreement wherein the

parties hereto agree that such agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Province of Ontario or the laws of Canada, subject to the assumptions that (i) in selecting the law of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein, the parties acted in good faith and in the absence of misrepresentation, duress, undue influence or mistake, (ii) the application of such Canadian law does not and would not be deemed by such courts to violate any fundamental public policy of (A) any particular law (other than those of the State of Delaware) applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (B) a state or country which has a materially greater interest than the Province of Ontario or Canada, in the determination of the particular issue in dispute, and (iii) that the parties (other than the Company) do not have assets, conduct business or have employees in the State of Delaware (but no opinion will be given to whether such Delaware court or federal court would retain jurisdiction of a proceeding arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement);

^^under the Delaware Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act (the “**Delaware Act**”), a Delaware state court or a United States federal court sitting in the State of Delaware will recognize as conclusive between the immediate parties a judgment to the extent that it grants or denies recovery of a sum of money rendered by an Ontario court under this Agreement if such judgment is final and conclusive and enforceable in a court in Ontario, and such judgment will be enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of another state which is entitled to full faith and credit, except that the enforcement thereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally. For purposes of this opinion, a judgment of a court of Ontario will be conclusive under the Delaware Act only if: (a) the judgment was rendered under a system which provides impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law; (b) the court of Ontario had personal jurisdiction over the defendant; and (c) the court of Ontario had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case. Under the Delaware Act, a judgment of a court of Ontario will be recognized only if: (u) the defendant in the proceedings in the court of Ontario received notice of the proceedings in sufficient time to enable the defendant to defend; (v) the judgment was not obtained by fraud; (w) the cause of action on which the judgment is based is not repugnant to the public policy of the State of Delaware; (x) the judgment does not conflict with another final and conclusive judgment; (y) the proceeding in the court of Ontario was not contrary to an agreement between the parties under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court; and (z) in the case of jurisdiction based only on personal service, the court of Ontario was not a seriously inconvenient forum for the trial of the action; and

^^no stamp, registration or similar taxes or public charges are payable in the State of Delaware in respect of this Agreement by the Company.

At the Time of Closing, the Underwriters shall have received a Rule 10b-5 negative assurance statement, dated as of the Time of Closing, of Dorsey & Whitney LLP, United States counsel for the Company, to the effect that such counsel has participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the U.S. Final Prospectus and in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, Canadian counsel for the Company, representatives of the independent accountants for the Company, counsel for the Underwriters and representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the U.S. Final Prospectus and related matters were discussed and although such counsel has not independently verified, and is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for, the factual accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement and the U.S. Final Prospectus, on the basis of such

participation, no facts have come to such counsel’s attention which have caused such counsel to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, at the time of its most recent effective date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the U.S. Final Prospectus, as of the date of the U.S. Final Prospectus, as of the Applicable Time and as of the Closing Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case, other than the financial statements and other financial information, and the information included in or derived from reports of, or attributed to, persons named in the U.S. Final Prospectus under the heading “Interest of Experts”, included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief.

^^other than the Offering, no material change relating to the Company on a consolidated basis has occurred since the date of this Agreement with respect to which the requisite material change report has not been filed, and no such disclosure has been made on a confidential basis that remains confidential;

^^there has been no change in any material fact (which includes the disclosure of any previously undisclosed material fact) contained in the Prospectuses which fact or change is, or may be, of such a nature as to render any statement in the Prospectuses misleading or untrue in any material respect or which would result in a misrepresentation (as defined under Canadian Securities Laws) in the Prospecutuses or which would result in the Prospectuses not complying with Applicable Securities Laws; and

^^the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement and in any certificates of the Company delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, are true and correct as at the Time of Closing, with the same force and effect as if made on and as at the Time of Closing, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

^**Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Underwriters**

^Each of the Underwriters represents and warrants to the Company, severally, and not jointly, on its behalf and on behalf of any of its U.S. affiliates, and acknowledges that the Company is relying upon such representations and warranties in entering into this Agreement, that (i) it is, and will remain so until the completion of the Offering, appropriately registered under Canadian Securities Laws and/or U.S. Securities Laws, as applicable, so as to permit it to lawfully fulfil its obligations hereunder, and (ii) it will sell the Offered Securities in accordance with Canadian Securities Laws, U.S. Securities Laws and the laws of any other jurisdictions in which the Offered Securities are offered and sold under the Offering.

^Each of the Underwriters covenants and agrees with the Company that it shall, through the Lead Underwriters, notify the Company when, in the Underwriters’ opinions, the Underwriters, together with such other investment dealers and brokers, have ceased distribution of the Offered Securities, and provide a breakdown of the number of Offered Securities distributed: (i) in each of the Qualifying Jurisdictions where such breakdown is required for the purpose of calculating fees payable to securities regulatory authorities; and (ii) in any other jurisdictions.

^**Over-Allotment Option**

^The Company hereby grants to the Underwriters, for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, or for market stabilization purposes, the Over-Allotment Option to purchase the Over- Allotment Securities at the Issue Price. The Over-Allotment Option is exercisable in whole or in part at any time or times on or before 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the 30th day following the Closing Date. For greater certainty, the Underwriters shall be paid the Underwriting Fee in respect of the issue and sale of any Over-Allotment Securities purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option. The Lead Underwriters, on behalf of the Underwriters, may exercise the Over-Allotment Option from time to time, in whole or in part, during the currency thereof by delivering written notice to the Company (the “**Over-Allotment Notice**”) specifying the number of Over-Allotment Securities which the Underwriters wish to purchase. If the Underwriters exercise the Over-Allotment Option, the Underwriters shall, on the Over-Allotment Closing Date, which shall be a date that is not less than three Business Days and not more than seven Business Days after the date of the Over-Allotment Notice (such date to be specified by the Lead Underwriters in their sole discretion), pay to the Company the aggregate purchase price for the Over-Allotment Securities so purchased by wire transfer, certified cheque or bank draft in Canadian currency payable at par in Toronto, Ontario against delivery of one or more certificates in definitive form representing the Over-Allotment Securities, registered in the name of “CDS & Co.” or in such other name as the Lead Underwriters on behalf of the Underwriters may direct. The applicable terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 7 of this Agreement relating to closing deliveries unless otherwise agreed to by the Underwriters and the Company, provided that references therein to “Closing Date” shall be changed to “Over-Allotment Closing Date”) shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to the issuance of any Over-Allotment Securities pursuant to any exercise of the Over-Allotment Option, except as otherwise agreed by the Company and the Lead Underwriters, it being

acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall not be obligated to deliver a title opinion in accordance with Section 7(6) of this Agreement on the Over-Allotment Closing Date.

^In the event that the Company shall subdivide, consolidate, reclassify or otherwise change its Common Shares during the period in which the Over-Allotment Option is exercisable, appropriate adjustments will be made to the Issue Price and to the number of Over-Allotment Securities issuable on exercise thereof such that the Underwriters are entitled to arrange for the sale of the same number and type of securities that the Underwriters would have otherwise arranged for had they exercised such Over-Allotment Option immediately prior to such subdivision, consolidation, reclassification or change.

^**Compensation of the Underwriters**

In consideration their services hereunder, the Company agrees to pay to the Underwriters at the applicable Time of Closing a cash fee (the “**Underwriting Fee**”) equal to [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the aggregate gross cash proceeds received from the sale of the Purchased Securities or the Over-Allotment Securities, as the case may be, in consideration of the services to be rendered by the Underwriters in connection with the Offering 

The foregoing Underwriting Fee may, at the sole option of the Underwriters, be deducted from the aggregate gross proceeds of the sale of the Purchased Securities or the Over-Allotment Securities, as the case may be, and withheld for the account of the Underwriters. For greater certainty, the services provided by the Underwriters in connection herewith will not be subject to the Goods and Services Tax (“**GST**”) provided for in the *Excise Tax Act* (Canada) and taxable supplies provided will be incidental to the exempt financial services provided. However, in the event that the Canada Revenue Agency determines that GST provided for in the *Excise Tax Act* (Canada) is exigible on the Underwriting Fee, the Company agrees to pay the amount of GST forthwith upon the request of the Underwriters. The Company also agrees to pay the Underwriters’ expenses as set forth in section 16 hereof. 

^**Termination Rights**

^All terms and conditions set out in this Agreement shall be construed as conditions and any breach or failure by the Company to comply with any such conditions in favour of the Underwriters shall entitle the Underwriters to terminate their obligation to purchase the Offered Securities by written notice to that effect given to the Company prior to the Time of Closing. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause all conditions in this Agreement to be satisfied. It is understood that the Underwriters may waive in whole or in part, or extend the time for compliance with, any of such terms and conditions without prejudice to their rights in respect of any subsequent breach or non-compliance, provided that, to be binding on the Underwriters, any such waiver or extension must be in writing.

^In addition to any other remedies which may be available to the Underwriters in respect of any default, act or failure to act, or non-compliance with the terms of this Agreement by the Company, the Underwriters (or any of them) shall be entitled, at their option, to terminate and cancel, without any liability on the part of the Underwriters, their obligations under this Agreement to purchase the Offered Securities by giving written notice to the Company at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Time of Closing:

^^if there is a material change in the affairs of the Company or there is discovered any previously undisclosed material fact required to be disclosed in the Offering Documents or there occurs a change in a material fact contained in the Offering Documents, in each case which, in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriters (or any of them), could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the market price or value of the Offered Securities or any other securities of the Company;

^^if there should develop, occur or come into effect or existence any event, action, state, condition or major financial occurrence of national or international consequence, including without limitation, any war or act of terrorism, or any law or regulation which, in the opinion of the Underwriters (or any of them), seriously and adversely affects, or involves, or will seriously and adversely affect, or involve, the financial markets in Canada or the United States or the business, operations or affairs of the Company;

^^if any inquiry, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding, whether formal or informal, is commenced, threatened or publicly announced or any order or ruling is made under or pursuant to any statute or by any federal, provincial or other governmental authority, commission or securities regulatory authority, board, stock exchange, bureau, agency or instrumentality in relation to the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Company’s directors or officers, which, in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriters (or any one of them), operates to prevent or restrict materially the distribution or trading of the Offered Securities or other securities of the Company or significantly adversely affects the business, operations and affairs of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

^^if trading in any securities of the Company has been, or is threatened to be, suspended or materially limited by any Securities Commission, the SEC, the TSX or NYSE AMEX or if trading generally on the TSX or NYSE AMEX has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by the TSX or NYSE AMEX or by order of any Securities Commission, the SEC or any other governmental or regulatory authority;

^^if the Company is in breach of any material term, condition or covenant of this Agreement and such breach is, in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriters, not capable of being cured prior to the Time of Closing.

^If the obligations of the Underwriters are terminated under this Agreement pursuant to these termination rights, the liability of the Company to the Underwriters shall be limited to the obligations under Sections 14, 15 and 16.

^A notice of termination given by one Underwriter under Section 12 shall not be binding upon the other Underwriters.

^**Survival of Representations and Warranties**

All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained or contained in any documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement and in connection with the transaction of purchase and sale herein contemplated shall survive the purchase and sale of the Offered Securities and the termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect for the benefit of the Underwriters and/or the Company, as the case may be, in accordance with applicable law, regardless of any subsequent disposition of the Offered Securities or any investigation by or on behalf of the Underwriters with respect thereto for a period ending on the later of: (i) the date that is two years following the Closing Date, and (ii) the latest date under the Applicable Securities Laws relevant to a substituted purchaser of the Offered Securities (non-residents of Canada or the United States being deemed to be residents in the Province of Ontario for such purposes) that a substituted purchaser may be entitled to commence an action or exercise a right of rescission with respect to a misrepresentation, a misstatement or an omission of a material fact in the Prospectuses or, if applicable, any Supplementary Material. The Underwriters and the Company shall be entitled to rely on the representations and warranties of the Company or the Underwriters, as the case may be, contained herein or delivered pursuant hereto notwithstanding any investigation which the Underwriters or the Company may undertake or which may be undertaken on their behalf. Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions contained in this Agreement relating to the indemnification or the contribution obligations shall survive in full force and effect, indefinitely. 

^**Indemnity**

^The Company covenants and agrees to indemnify and save the Underwriters and/or any of their respective affiliates, the respective directors, officers, employees and agents thereof and each person who controls any such Underwriter within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act (individually, an “**Indemnified Party**” and collectively, the “**Indemnified Parties**”) harmless from and against any and all expenses, losses (other than loss of profits), claims, actions, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several (including the aggregate amount paid in reasonable settlement of any actions, suits, proceedings or claims), and the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel that may be incurred in advising with respect to and/or defending any claim that may be made against the Indemnified Parties, to which the Indemnified Parties (or any of them) may become subject or otherwise involved in any capacity under any statute or common law or otherwise insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based, directly or indirectly, upon the performance of professional services rendered to the Company by the Indemnified Parties or otherwise in connection with the matters referred to in this Agreement, including, without limitation, in any way caused by, or arising directly or indirectly from, or in consequence of:

^^any misrepresentation or alleged misrepresentation contained in this Agreement;

^^any untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact that is required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading contained in the Registration Statement;

^^any untrue statement of material fact or omission to state a material fact that is required to be stated therein or that is necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading contained in this Agreement, the Canadian Preliminary Prospectus, the Canadian Final Prospectus, the U.S. Preliminary Prospectus, the U.S. Final Prospectus, any Supplementary Material, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Documents Incorporated by Reference;

^^any information or statement (except any information or statement relating solely to the Underwriters) contained in any certificate of the Company delivered under or pursuant to this Agreement which at the time and in light of the circumstances under which it was made contains or is alleged to contain a misrepresentation;

^^any omission or alleged omission to state, in any certificate of the Company delivered under or pursuant to this Agreement, any fact (except facts relating solely to the Underwriters) required to be stated in such document or necessary to make any statement in such document not misleading in light of the circumstances under which it was made; or

^^the non-compliance or alleged non-compliance by the Company with any requirements of Applicable Securities Laws (except if such failure to file is the result of any act or failure to act of the Underwriters (or any of them) other than the termination of this Agreement).

^Notwithstanding subsection 14(1), the indemnification in subsection 14(1) does not and shall not apply to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment that has become non- appealable shall determine that:

^^the Indemnified Parties have been negligent or have committed any fraudulent or illegal act or act of unlawful misconduct in the course of the performance of professional

services rendered to the Company by the Indemnified Parties or otherwise in connection with the matters referred to in this Agreement; and

^^the expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as to which indemnification is claimed, were directly caused by the negligence, illegality, fraud or act of unlawful misconduct referred to in subsection 14(2)(a).

^If any matter or thing contemplated by this Section 14 shall be asserted against any Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such Indemnified Party will notify the Company as soon as possible of the nature of such claim (provided that omission to so notify the Company will not relieve the Company of any liability that it may otherwise have to the Indemnified Party hereunder, except to the extent the Company is materially prejudiced by such omission) and, subject to subsection 14(4), the Company shall be entitled (but not required) to assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such claim; provided, however, that the defence shall be through legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party and that no settlement may be made by the Company or such Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

^The Company shall be entitled, at its own expense, to participate in and, to the extent it may wish to do so, assume the defence thereof, provided such defence is conducted by experienced and competent counsel. Upon the Company notifying such Indemnified Party in writing of its election to assume the defence and retaining counsel, the Company shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by them in connection with such defence. If such defence is assumed by the Company, the Company throughout the course thereof will provide copies of all relevant documentation to such Indemnified Party, will keep such Indemnified Party advised of the progress thereof and will discuss with such Indemnified Party all significant actions proposed.

^Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, any Indemnified Party shall have the right, at the Company’s expense, to employ counsel of such Indemnified Party’s choice, in respect of the defence of any action, suit, proceeding, claim or investigation if: (i) the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the Company; or (ii) the Company has not assumed the defence and employed counsel therefor within a reasonable time after receiving notice of such action, suit, proceeding, claim or investigation; or (iii) counsel retained by the Company or such Indemnified Party has advised such Indemnified Party that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate for any reason, including without limitation because there may be legal defences available to such Indemnified Party which are different from or in addition to those available to the Company (in which event and to that extent, the Company shall not have the right to assume or direct the defence on such Indemnified Party’s behalf) or that there is a conflict of interest between the Company and such Indemnified Party or the subject matter of the action, suit, proceeding, claim or investigation may not fall within the indemnity set forth herein (in either of which events the Company shall not have the right to assume or direct the defence on such Indemnified Party’ behalf).

^No admission of liability and no settlement of any action, suit, proceeding, claim or investigation shall be made without the consent of the Indemnified Parties affected. No admission of liability shall be made and the Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any action, suit, proceeding, claim or investigation made without its consent.

^To the extent that any Indemnified Party is not a party to this Agreement, the Underwriters shall obtain and hold the right and benefit of this Section 14 in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party.

^The Company hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in any court in which any claim that is subject to indemnification hereunder is brought against the Underwriters or any Indemnified Party and to the assignment of the benefit of this Section 14 to any Indemnified Party for the purpose of enforcement provided that nothing herein shall limit the Company’s right or ability to contest the appropriate jurisdiction or forum for the determination of any such claims.

^**Contribution**

If for any reason (other than the occurrence of any of the events itemized in subsection 14(2)), the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to the Indemnified Parties or insufficient to hold them harmless, then the Company shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the Indemnified Parties as a result of such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters, as well as any relevant equitable considerations; provided that the Company shall, in any event, contribute to the amount paid or payable by the Underwriters as a result of such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability, any excess of such amount over the amount of the fees received by the Underwriters pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The right to contribution provided in this Section 15 shall be in addition and not in derogation of any other right to contribution which the Indemnified Parties may have by statute or otherwise by law. 

^**Expenses**

The Company will pay all costs and expenses in connection with the Offering, including, without limitation: (i) all expenses of or incidental to the creation, issue, sale or distribution of the Offered Securities; (ii) the preparation and filing of the Prospectuses or any Supplementary Material; (ii) the fees and disbursements of legal counsel to the Company; (iii) all costs incurred in connection with the preparation of documentation relating to the Offering; and (iv) the reasonable fees and disbursements, plus GST thereon, of the Underwriters’ legal counsel. All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Underwriters or on their behalf shall be payable by the Company immediately upon receiving an invoice therefor from the Underwriters and shall be payable whether or not the Offering is completed. 

^**Liability of the Underwriters**

^The obligation of the Underwriters to purchase the Offered Securities at the Time of Closing shall be several, and not joint, nor joint and several, and shall be as to the following percentages to be purchased at any such time:

Cormark Securities Inc. 1,         %
GMP Securities L.P. 1,         %
Canaccord Genuity Corp.       %
Dundee Securities Corporation       %
Desjardins Securities Inc.       %
National Bank Financial Inc.       %
Dahlman Rose & Company       %

^^%

^Co-Lead Underwriters

^Joint bookrunners and step-up fee of [[Percentage 3: Number]]%

^In the event that any Underwriter shall fail to purchase its applicable percentage of the Offered Securities (the **“Defaulted Securities**”) at the Time of Closing, the other Underwriters shall have the right, within 36 hours thereafter, to make arrangements to purchase all, but not less than all, of

the Defaulted Securities, in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms set forth herein. If, however, the Underwriters shall have not completed such arrangements within such 36 hour period, then:

^^if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed [[Percentage 1]]% of the number of Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligation of all non- defaulting Underwriters, or

^^if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds [[Percentage 1]]% of the number of Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.

^No action taken pursuant to this Section 17 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default to the Company or to any non-defaulting Underwriter.

^In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or the Over- Allotment Closing Date, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven calendar days in order to effect any required changes to the Prospectuses.

^**Action by Underwriters**

All steps which must or may be taken by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement, with the exception of the matters relating to termination contemplated by Section 12, may be taken by the Lead Underwriters on behalf of the Lead Underwriters and the other Underwriters, and the execution of this Agreement by the Company shall constitute the Company’s authority for accepting notification of any such steps from, and for delivering the definitive documents constituting the Offered Securities to, or to the order of, the Lead Underwriters. 

^**No Fiduciary Duty**

The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm’s-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principals and not as an agents or fiduciaries of the Company, and (c) the Company’s engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the Offering and the process leading up to the Offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the Offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be void or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such void or unenforceable provision shall not affect or impair the validity of any other provision of this Agreement and shall be severable from this Agreement.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Underwriters and the Company relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements between the Underwriters and the Company relating to the Offering. 

^**Obligations of the Underwriters**

In performing their respective obligations under this Agreement, the Underwriters shall be acting severally and not jointly and severally. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create any relationship in the nature of a partnership, or joint venture between the Underwriters. 

^**Market Stabilization**

In connection with the distribution of the Offered Securities, the Underwriters (or any of them) may effect transactions which stabilize or maintain the market price of the Common Shares at levels other than those which might otherwise prevail in the open market, but in each case as permitted by Applicable Securities Laws. Such stabilizing transactions, if any, may be discontinued by the Underwriters at any time. 

^**Judgement Currency**

The parties acknowledge and agree that: 

^^if, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into a particular currency (the “**Judgment Currency**”) any amount due in Canadian dollars, then the conversion shall be made on the basis of the rate of exchange prevailing on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which judgment is given. For the foregoing purposes “rate of exchange” means the rate at which such party, in accordance with its normal banking procedures, is able on the relevant date to purchase Canadian currency with the Judgment Currency after deducting any premium and costs of exchange; and

^^the obligation of the parties in respect of any sum due to any of the other parties hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than Canadian dollars, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such party of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency, such party may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase Canadian dollars with such other currency after deducting any premiums and costs of exchange. In the event that the amount of the Canadian dollars so purchased is less than the sum originally due in Canadian dollars, the party, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the other parties against such loss, and if the amount of Canadian dollars so purchased exceeds the sum originally due in Canadian dollars, the parties agree to remit such excess forthwith.

^**Effective Date**

This Agreement is intended to and shall take effect as of the date first set forth above, notwithstanding its actual date of execution or delivery.
