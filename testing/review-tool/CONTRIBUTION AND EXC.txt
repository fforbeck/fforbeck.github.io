^^**Indemnification Procedures**.  
^^A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third party claim must be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

^^In the event that any Proceedings shall be instituted or that any claim or demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which indemnification may be sought under **Section** [8.2](#_Ref221604243) (“**Third Party Claim**”), the indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying party’s obligations with respect thereto unless the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure. Subject to the provisions of this **Section** [8.3](#_Ref221604305), the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder; provided that the indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in writing to the indemnified party its unqualified obligation to indemnify the indemnified party as provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder, it shall within ten days of the indemnified party’s written notice of the assertion of such Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so; provided that the indemnifying party must conduct its defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this regard. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified party of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under this Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim. If the indemnified party defends any Third Party Claim, then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided that such indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified party a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate representation advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any Third Party Claim. Each party hereto agrees to provide each other party with reasonable access to such documents and information as may reasonably be requested in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this **Section** [8.3](#_Ref221604305) to the contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant (or claimants) and such party provide to such other party an unqualified release from all liab ility in respect of the Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

^^After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case with respect to an Third Party Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall pay all of such remaining sums so due and owing to the indemnified party by wire transfer of immediately available funds within 20 Business Days after the date of such notice.

The Overriding Royalty Interest shall be determined and administered in accordance with the provisions of Sections 1 through 3 of this PART II.

\centered **Definitions**

As used in this PART II, the following words, terms or phrases shall have the following meanings:

^“Conveyance” means this Assignment, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement.

^“Excess Production Costs” at any point in time means an amount equal to the excess of Production Costs over Gross Proceeds for the period ending with such point and beginning with the end of the most recent Period in which there were Net Proceeds.

^“General and Administrative Costs” means those additional costs, of whatever nature, deemed necessary by Assignee to properly operate and/or manage the Subject Properties under this Conveyance and that are not properly classified as Production Costs. Initially, General and Administrative Costs will be charged on a cents-per-mile or dollars-per-well basis utilizing surveys and escalators normally used in the oil and gas industry; provided, however, that the use of such surveys and escalators shall not act to place a floor or cap on such costs.

^“Gross Proceeds” means the amounts received on or after the Effective Date, generally on the cash method of accounting, by WI Owner, without duplication, from the sale or other disposition of Subject Minerals, subject to the following:

^^There shall be included any amount which WI Owner shall receive as a result of net profits interests, overriding and other royalty interests owned by WI Owner and included as part of the Subject Interests.

^^There shall be excluded any amount for Subject Minerals attributable to nonconsent operations conducted with respect to the Subject Interests (or any portion thereof) as to which WI Owner shall be a nonconsenting party and which is dedicated to the recoupment or reimbursement of costs and expenses of the consenting party or parties by the terms of the relevant operating agreement, unit agreement, contract for development or other agreement providing for such nonconsent operations.

^^If a controversy exists (whether by reason of any statute, order, decree, rule, regulation, contract or otherwise) between WI Owner and any purchaser from WI Owner or any other third party as to the correct sales price or sales volume of any Subject Minerals, then

^^^amounts withheld by the purchaser or any such third party or deposited by it in an interest bearing account with a commercial bank as escrow agent shall not be considered to be received by WI Owner and shall not be credited to the Net Proceeds Account (as defined in Section 2.4 below) until actually collected by WI Owner, and the proceeds of such account less the interest earned thereon, if any, shall thereafter be distributed in accordance with this Conveyance and the interest earned thereon, if any, allocable to the Royalty Owner shall (if agreed upon by depositor and escrow agent) be paid directly to the Royalty Owner by any such escrow agent upon resolution of such controversy, and such interest shall not be deemed to const itute a portion of Gross Proceeds; and

^^^amounts received by WI Owner and held in suspense (not paid) or promptly deposited by it in an interest bearing account with a commercial bank as escrow agent shall not be considered to have been received by WI Owner and shall not be credited to the Net Proceeds Account until removed by WI Owner from suspense or until disbursed to WI Owner by such escrow agent, and the proceeds of such account less the interest earned thereon, if any, shall thereafter be distributed in accordance with this Conveyance and the interest earned thereon, if any, allocable to the Royalty Owner shall be paid directly to the Royalty Owner by such escrow agent upon resolution of such controversy, and such interest shall not be deemed to constitute a po rtion of Gross Proceeds.

^^If any portion of the amounts described in Section 1.5(d) above are in good faith determined by WI Owner to be subject to cash balancing and WI Owner determines in good faith that the potential cash balancing amount may exceed future Net Proceeds when the cash balancing contingency occurs, then:

^^^an amount up to the amount subject to cash balancing (or a reasonable estimate thereof) shall be excluded from future Gross Proceeds, shall be held in suspense (not paid) or deposited by WI Owner in an interest bearing escrow account with an escrow agent and shall not be credited to the Net Proceeds Account until disbursed in accordance with the provisions of (ii) below; and

^^^amounts held in suspense (not paid) or placed in interest bearing escrow accounts as provided above shall be distributed either to (a) Royalty Owner and WI Owner in accordance with this Conveyance when WI Owner determines in good faith that the potential for cash balancing no longer exists as to all or a portion of the funds in suspense or in such account, provided, that interest earned, if any, on any such escrow account allocable to the Royalty Owner shall be paid directly to the Royalty Owner by the escrow agent, and such interest shall not be deemed to constitute either a portion of Gross Proceeds or a reduction to Production Costs as described in Section 1.14(c), or (b) WI Owner for the cash balancing due to any party due such cash balancing.

^^There shall be excluded any amount for Subject Minerals unavoidably lost or used in the production thereof and any imputed or calculated amount for domestic gas delivered but not sold or for line loss or fuel gas used in the production of Subject Minerals or used by WI Owner in conformity with prudent practices for drilling, production, operation or plant operations (including gas injection, compression, gathering, treating, conditioning, transporting, dehydration, secondary recovery, pressure maintenance, repressuring, recycling operations, plant fuel or shrinkage) (i) conducted for the purpose of producing Subject Minerals or marketing or making marketable the Subject Minerals or (ii) from any unit to which the Subject Interes ts are committed, but only so long as such Subject Minerals are so used and the cost thereof is not borne by others and paid to WI Owner.

^^Gross Proceeds shall not include any amounts described in Section 1.14(c) hereof.

^^Gross Proceeds shall not include any amounts received by WI Owner from third parties as the result of cash balancing obligations relating to underproduced positions which affect the Subject Interests.

^^Gross Proceeds shall include any amount received as bonus for any oil, gas and/or mineral lease executed by WI Owner after the Effective Date and covering any portion of the Subject Interests.

^^Gross Proceeds shall not include amounts attributable to the interests of parties other than WI Owner and the Royalty Owner in the lands described in Exhibit A and shall not include any amounts paid that are attributable to production payments, royalties or overriding royalties payable to such other parties.

^“Lease” or “Leases” means the oil, gas and mineral leases (or portions thereof or interests therein, including, without limitation, any royalty interests, overriding royalty interests and similar interests) described in Exhibit A attached hereto.

^“Minerals” means oil, gas, other liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons and other minerals, whether similar or dissimilar.

^“Net Proceeds” for any Period after the Effective Date means the excess of Gross Proceeds received by WI Owner during such Period over the sum of (a) Production Costs paid during such Period and (b) Excess Production Costs as of the end of the immediately preceding Period, as such Net Proceeds are computed in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof.

^“Overproduced Party” means a party to a gas balancing arrangement who, as a result of producing, in addition to its own share of production, that portion of another party’s share of production which such other party is unable or unwilling to market or otherwise to dispose of, is in a position of net over-production with respect to such other party or parties to such gas balancing arrangement.

^“Period” means one calendar month; provided, however, that the first Period shall run from the Effective Date to the last day of the calendar month in which the Effective Date falls.

^“Person” means any individual, corporation, partnership, trust, estate or other entity or organization.

\centered SECTION 2

\centered **Payment**

^**Payment**. On the 10th day of each Period (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the Business Day next preceding such day), WI Owner shall pay to the Royalty Owner as an overriding royalty hereunder an amount equal to [[Percentage 5]]% of the Net Proceeds for the preceding Period, computed in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof.

^**Interest on Past Due Payments**. Any amount not paid by WI Owner to the Royalty Owner when due shall bear, and WI Owner will pay, interest at the weighted average Prime Interest Rate in effect during the period of underpayment; provided that such interest shall not be in excess of the maximum amount allowed by law. Under no circumstances, however, shall WI Owner willfully withhold payment properly due the Royalty Owner hereunder.

^**Overpayment**. If at any time WI Owner inadvertently pays the Royalty Owner more than the amount due, the Royalty Owner shall not be obligated to return any such overpayment, but the amount or amounts otherwise payable for any subsequent Period or Periods shall be reduced by such overpayment.

^**Net Proceeds Account**. A Net Proceeds account (the “Net Proceeds Account”) shall be maintained by WI Owner for each Period after the Effective Date. The Net 

Proceeds Account shall be credited with the aggregate of any Gross Proceeds received during such Period, and shall be debited with the aggregate of any Production Costs paid during such Period. The amounts provided for in Section 1.14(c) hereof shall be taken into account for the sole and only purpose of reducing amounts that would otherwise be debited to the Net Proceeds Account in accordance herewith, and Royalty Owner shall have no right, title or claim to such amounts.

On or before the date of payment as set forth in Section 2.1 hereof, WI Owner shall furnish to the Royalty Owner a detailed statement clearly reflecting the credits and debits against and the balance of the Net Proceeds Account for the applicable Period. Any Excess Production Cost reflected by any such statement shall be carried forward to the next and succeeding Period or Periods until the Excess Production Costs shall have been liquidated. If, at the end of any Period, there are Excess Production Costs which have not been liquidated in accordance with the preceding sentence, then an amount equal to interest at the Prime Interest Rate in effect on the last day of such Period shall be computed on the unliquidated balance of the Excess Production Costs from the last day of such Period to the last day of the following Period, and such a mount shall be treated as a Production Cost in such following Period.

In the event that Net Proceeds exist in the Net Proceeds Account at the end of any month, payment to the Royalty Owner of the amount of the Net Proceeds pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be paid promptly by WI Owner to the Royalty Owner.

WI Owner shall maintain the Net Proceeds Account in accordance with good accounting practice and in a manner to minimize accounting difficulties but accomplish on a fiscal year basis the overall goal of this Conveyance, and the books and records relating thereto shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection, examination, copying and audit by the Royalty Owner and its duly authorized agents and representatives.

^**Limitation**. All payments made to Royalty Owner shall be made entirely and exclusively out of amounts received from the sale or other disposition of Subject Minerals produced from Subject Interests after the Effective Date, and in no event shall such payments exceed [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of the value of such production at the wellhead (based upon the terms upon which such production is marketed by WI Owner) before the application of any Processing. Should the payments to Royalty Owner, computed in accordance herewith ever exceed such amount (such excess amount being herein referred to as the “Overage”), such Overage shall be suspended and accrued; and if the payments calculated in accordance herewith are ever again less than [[Percentage 6]]% of the value of such production at the wellhead before the application of any Processing, the Overage shall be added to subsequent payments but not in an amount which would then cause payments to exceed [[Percentage 6]]% of the value of such production at the wellhead before the application of any Processing, so that Royalty Owner, if possible, shall be entitled to receive the total amount to be distributed hereunder as if the limitation imposed by this Section had not been in effect.

\centered SECTION 3

\centered **Miscellaneous**

^**Non-Liability of Royalty Owner**. In no event shall the Royalty Owner be liable or responsible in any way for payment of any Production Costs or other costs or liabilities incurred by WI Owner or other lessees attributable to the Subject Interests or to the Minerals produced therefrom.

^**Intention of the Parties**. Nothing herein contained is intended to create, nor shall the same be construed as creating (under state law or for tax purposes), any mining partnership, commercial partnership or other partnership relation or joint venture. If, however, the parties hereto are deemed to constitute a partnership for federal or state income tax purposes, the parties elect to be excluded from the application of Subchapter K, Chapter 1, Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or any similar state law, and agree not to take any position inconsistent with such election. In addition, the parties her eto intend that the Overriding Royalty Interest conveyed hereby by WI Owner to the Royalty Owner shall at all times be treated as a nonoperating “economic interest” in the Subject Minerals within the meaning of the Code (or any corresponding provisions of succeeding law) and a non-operating mineral right for state law purposes.

THE OVERRIDING ROYALTY INTEREST CREATED BY THIS CONVEYANCE IS A RIGHT AFFECTING AND BURDENING THE SUBJECT INTERESTS. THIS CONVEYANCE CREATES AN INTEREST IN REAL PROPERTY, AND THE COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THIS CONVEYANCE ARE COVENANTS RUNNING WITH AND BURDENING THE LAND.

\centered **PART III**

In connection with the foregoing transfer of the Subject Properties to the Assignee, the Assignee agrees, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to assume, at the Effective Date, and thereafter to pay (i) all Production Costs, as defined in PART II of this Conveyance, and any other costs, expenses, and liabilities relating to the Subject Properties, which are incurred on or after the Effective Date or relate to the period on or after the Effective Date, and (ii) all Production Costs which are incurred in the Period prior to the Effective Date and which are payable after the Effective Date in the ordinary course of business (collectively, the “Assumed Liabilities”).

The Assignor agrees to pay all those Production Costs which are incurred prior to the Effective Date other than those referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph.

\centered **PART IV**

This Assignment, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement is being executed in several counterparts, all of which are identical, except that, to facilitate recordation, a counterpart hereof being filed or recorded in a particular jurisdiction may have omitted therefrom those portions of 

Exhibit A which describe properties, rights or interests located in other jurisdictions. All of such counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Complete copies of this Assignment have been retained by Assignor and Assignee.

This Assignment shall bind and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
