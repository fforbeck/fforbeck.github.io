THIS AGREEMENT is effective as of the Grant Date, by and between the Participant and Assured Guaranty Ltd. (the “Company”).

WHEREAS, the Company maintains the Assured Guaranty Ltd. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and the Participant has been selected by the committee administering the Plan (the “Committee”) to receive a Non-Qualified Stock Option Award under the Plan; and

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED, by and between the Company and the Participant, as follows:

^Terms of Award. The following words and phrases used in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in this paragraph 1:

^^The “Participant” is

^^The “Grant Date” is [[Date 1: Date]]**.**

^^The number of “Covered Shares” shall be shares of Stock.

^^The “Exercise Price” is $ per share.

Other words and phrases used in this Agreement are defined pursuant to paragraph 17, elsewhere in this Agreement or the Plan.

^Non-Qualified Stock Option. This Agreement specifies the terms of the option (the “Option”) granted to the Participant to purchase the number of Covered Shares of Stock at the Exercise Price per share as set forth in paragraph 1. The Option is not intended to constitute an “incentive stock option” as that term is used in Code section 422.

^Date of Exercise. Subject to the limitations of this Agreement, each Installment of Covered Shares of the Option shall be exercisable on and after the Vesting Date for such Installment as described in the following schedule (but only if the Date of Termination has not occurred before the Vesting Date):

\centered **INSTALLMENT**      \centered **VESTING DATE APPLICABLE TO INSTALLMENT** 

\centered 1/3 of Covered Shares      \centered One year anniversary of the Grant Date 

\centered 1/3 of Covered Shares      \centered Two year anniversary of the Grant Date 

\centered 1/3 of Covered Shares      

\centered Three year anniversary of the Grant Date  

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 3, the Option shall become vested and exercisable as follows:

^^The Option shall become fully exercisable upon the Date of Termination, if the Date of Termination occurs by reason of the Participant’s death or Disability.

^^The Option shall become fully exercisable upon a Change in Control that occurs on or before the Date of Termination.

^^If the Option is not fully exercisable upon the Participant’s Date of Termination, and the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs because of Retirement, then, for purposes of this paragraph 3 and subject to paragraph 17(g), the Participant shall be treated as though employed by the Company and Subsidiaries after the Participant’s actual Date of Termination until the Vesting Date has occurred with respect to all of the Covered Shares.

^^If the Option is not fully exercisable upon the Participant’s Date of Termination, and the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs by virtue of a Termination Without Cause, then for purposes of applying the foregoing vesting schedule, the Participant shall be treated as though employed by the Company and Subsidiaries after the Participant’s actual Date of Termination until the two-year anniversary of the Date of Termination. The terms “Cause” and “Terminated Without Cause” shall be defined as set forth in the Employment Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive’s employment is Terminated without Cause, the provisions of this paragraph (d) shall apply, and the provisions of paragraph 4(e) with respect to Retirement shall apply only if the Executive executes and returns to the Company a general release and waiver of all claims against the Company as required under the Employment Agreement.

Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) above, the Option may be exercised on or after the Date of Termination only as to that portion of the Covered Shares for which it was exercisable immediately prior to (or became exercisable on) the Date of Termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 3, as of the Participant’s Date of Termination for Cause, the Option shall be canceled as to any Covered Shares as to which it has not previously been exercised.

^Expiration. The Option shall not be exercisable after the Company’s close of business on the last business day that occurs prior to the Expiration Date. The “Expiration Date” shall be the earliest to occur of:

^^the ten-year anniversary of the Grant Date;

^^if the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs by reason of death or Disability, the two-year anniversary of such Date of Termination;

^^if the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs for Cause, the Date of Termination;

^^if the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs because of a Termination Without Cause, the two-year anniversary of the Date of Termination;

^^if the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs because of Retirement, the ten-year anniversary of the Grant Date, subject to paragraph 17(g); or

^^if the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs for any reason other than those listed in subparagraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this paragraph 4, the 90 day anniversary of such Date of Termination.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 4, if a Change in Control occurs on or before the Participant’s Date of Termination, the Expiration Date shall be the ten-year anniversary of the Grant Date.

^Method of Option Exercise. Subject to this Agreement and the Plan, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part by filing a written notice with the Secretary of the Company at its corporate headquarters prior to the Company’s close of business on the last business day that occurs prior to the Expiration Date. Such notice shall specify the number of shares of Stock which the Participant elects to purchase, and shall be accompanied by payment of the Exercise Price for such shares of Stock indicated by the Participant’s election. Payment shall be by cash or by check payable to the Company. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee before the Option is exercised: (i) all or a portion of the Exercise Price may be paid by the Participant by delivery of shares of Stock owned by the Participant and acceptable to the Committee having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued as of the date of exercise) that is equal to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required; and (ii) the Participant may pay the Exercise Price by authorizing a third party to sell shares of Stock (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise. The Option shall not be exercisable if and to the extent the Company determines that such exercise would violate applicable state or Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of any securities exchange on which the Stock is traded. If the Company makes such a determination, it shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain compliance with such laws, rules and regulations. In making any determination hereunder, the Company may rely on the opinion of counsel for the Company.

^Withholding. All deliveries and distributions under this Agreement are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes. At the election of the Participant, and subject to such rules and limitations as may be established by the Committee from time to time, such withholding obligations may be satisfied through the surrender of shares of Stock which the Participant already owns, or to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the Plan; provided, however, that such shares may be used to satisfy not more than the Company’s minimum statutory withholding obligation (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for Federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income).

^Transferability. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, the Option is not transferable other than as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and during the Participant’s life, may be exercised only by the Participant.

^Cancellation and Rescission of Options.

^^The Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict the Option at any time if the Participant engages in any “Detrimental Activity.”

^^Upon exercise of the Option, the Participant shall certify, to the extent provided by the Committee, in a manner acceptable to the Committee, that the Participant is not engaging and has not engaged in any Detrimental Activity. In the event a Participant has engaged in any Detrimental Activity prior to, or during the twelve months after, any exercise of the Option, such exercise may be rescinded by the Committee within two years thereafter. In the event of any such rescission, the Participant shall pay to the Company the amount of any gain realized as a result of the rescinded exercise, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as may be required, and the Company shall be entitled to set-off against the amount of any such gain any amount owed to the Participant by the Company and/or Subsidiary.

^Heirs and Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the Company and its successors and assigns, and upon any person acquiring, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise, all or substantially all of the Company’s assets and business. If any rights exercisable by the Participant or benefits deliverable to the Participant under this Agreement have not been exercised or delivered, respectively, at the time of the Participant’s death, such rights shall be exercisable by the Designated Beneficiary, and such benefits shall be delivered to the Designated Beneficiary, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan. The “Designated Beneficiary” shall be the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the Participant in a writing filed with the Committee in such form and at such time as the Committee shall require. If a deceased Participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or if the Designated Beneficiary does not survive the Participant, any rights that would have been exercisable by the Participant and any benefits distributable to the Participant shall be exercised by or distributed to the legal representative of the estate of the Participant. If a deceased Participant designates a beneficiary and the Designated Beneficiary survives the Participant but dies before the Designated Beneficiary’s exercise of all rights under this Agreement or before the complete distribution of benefits to the Designated Beneficiary under this Agreement, then any rights that would have been exercisable by the Designated Beneficiary shall be exercised by the legal representative of the estate of the Designated Beneficiary, and any benefits distributable to the Designated Beneficiary shall be distributed to the legal representative of the estate of the Designated Beneficiary.

^Administration. The authority to manage and control the operation and administration of this Agreement shall be vested in the Committee, and the Committee shall have all powers with respect to this Agreement as it has with respect to the Plan. Any interpretation of this Agreement by the Committee and any decision made by it with respect to this Agreement is final and binding on all persons. The Committee shall have the authority to obtain such information from the Participant (including tax return information) as it determines may be necessary to confirm that the Participant is in compliance with the requirements applicable to Detrimental Activity, and if the Participant fails to provide such information, the Committee may conclude that the Participant is not in compliance with such requirements.

^Recoupment and Plan Provisions Govern.

Executive Officer Recoupment Policy as in effect on the Grant Date, a copy of which policy is set forth in the Company’s Code of Conduct.**

^Not an Employment Contract. The Option will not confer on the Participant any right with respect to continuance of employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary, nor will it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have to terminate or modify the terms of such Participant’s employment or other service at any time.
