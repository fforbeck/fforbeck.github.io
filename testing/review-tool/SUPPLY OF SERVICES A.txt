The Company may terminate the Agreement for “Cause” upon the giving of a Notice of Termination to [[Disclosed Relationships]] and the Contractor, subject to the terms of this sub-part, which shall be effective immediately.

In the event the Company should terminate this agreement for Cause prior to the Then Effective Expiration Date [[Disclosed Relationships]] and/or Contractor shall with thirty (30) days thereof reassign any overriding royalty interests they may have received from Company under this agreement during that Then Effective Term. Neither [[Disclosed Relationships]] nor Contractor will be responsible for reassigning any overriding royalty interests which Contractor may have assigned to others.

\centered ASSIGNMENT OF OVERRIDING ROYALTY INTEREST

State: 
County: 
Assignor:   Imperial Oil & Gas, Inc.

Assignee:   [[the Contractor]]

Effective Date:  

Assignor, named above, owns working interest in the Oil and Gas Lease (the "Lease") on lands located in the county and state named above (the "Lands"). The Lease and Lands are described in Exhibit "A" to this Assignment.

For adequate consideration, Assignor assigns, transfers, and conveys to Assignee an overriding royalty interest in all of the oil and gas produced, saved and marketed from the Lease equal to [[Percentage 1]]% of 8/8 (the "Override").

The Override shall be free and clear of all costs and expenses. However, the Override shall bear and pay its proportionate part of all applicable taxes. The Override shall be proportionately reduced if it is determined the Lease covers less than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the mineral estate in the Lands, or Assignor owns less than [[Percentage 3]]% of the Lease.

Should the Lease be renewed or extended as to all or a part of the Lands, the Override shall be effective as to the renewed or extended Lease. Assignor reserves the right to pool the Lease and the Lands with other leases and lands without the consent or joinder of Assignee, and the Override shall be proportionately reduced in accordance with such pooling.

This Assignment is made without warranty, express or implied, and its terms and provisions shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of Assignor and Assignee and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns.
