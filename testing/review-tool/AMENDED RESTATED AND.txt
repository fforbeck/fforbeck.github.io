In connection therewith, each of the Borrowers has requested that Bank extend the maturities of the Existing Loans and restructure certain of the terms and conditions applicable to the Existing Loans, including the repayment terms applicable thereto.

As of the date hereof, the outstanding balance of principal and accrued interest on the Existing Loans is accurately set forth below:

**Loan**   **Principal**   **Interest**

On the date hereof, Borrowers have paid to Bank all of such accrued interest and have made a principal payment of $[[USD Value 18: Number]] on the Existing Loans. Furthermore, Borrowers have agreed to be jointly and severally liable for the outstanding principal balance of $[[USD Value 19: Number]] owing on the Existing Loans (which balance reflects the application of the $[[USD Value 18]] principal payment), as amended hereby (as so amended, the “Refinancing Loan”).

Together with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Borrowers have executed and delivered to Bank (a) the $[[USD Value 19]] Amended, Restated and Consolidated Promissory Note of even date herewith payable to the order of Bank (as amended, modified, restated and supplemented from time to time, the “Refinancing Note”) evidencing Borrowers’ joint and several obligations with respect to the Refinancing Loan, (b) one or more modification agreements such that the Existing Real Estate shall secure, in addition to the Existing Loans secured thereby in accordance with the respective terms of the Existing Mortgages, Borrowers’ joint and several obligations with respect to the Refinancing Loan, (c) one or more mortgages, deeds of trust, and other instruments pledging the Additional Real Estate to Bank as security for Borrowers’ joint and several obligations with respect to the Refinancing Loan, (d) one or more assignments, pledges and other instruments pledging the Securitization Interests to Bank as security for Borrowers’ joint and several obligations with respect to the Refinancing Loan, and (e) certain other agreements, documents, instruments and certificates with respect to this Agreement and the Refinancing Loan.
