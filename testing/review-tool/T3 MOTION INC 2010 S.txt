\centered **T3 MOTION, INC.**  **2010 STOCK OPTION/STOCK ISSUANCE PLAN** 

^**GENERAL PROVISIONS**  

^PURPOSE OF THE PLAN  

This 2010 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan (the “Plan”) is intended to promote the interests of T3 Motion, Inc., a Delaware corporation, by providing eligible persons with the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest, or otherwise increase their proprietary interest, in the Corporation as an incentive for them to remain in the service of the Corporation. 

Capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the attached Appendix. 

^STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN  

^The Plan shall be divided into two (2) separate equity programs: 

^^the Option Grant Program under which eligible persons may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be granted options to purchase shares of Common Stock, and 

^^the Stock Issuance Program under which eligible persons may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be issued shares of Common Stock directly, either through the immediate purchase of such shares or as a bonus for services rendered the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary). 

^The provisions of Sections I and IV shall apply to both equity programs under the Plan and shall accordingly govern the interests of all persons under the Plan. 

^ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN  

^The Plan shall be administered by the Board. However, any or all administrative functions otherwise exercisable by the Board may be delegated to the Committee. Members of the Committee shall serve for such period of time as the Board may determine and shall be subject to removal by the Board at any time. The Board may also at any time terminate the functions of the Committee and reassume all powers and authority previously delegated to the Committee. 

^The Plan Administrator shall have full power and authority (subject to the provisions of the Plan) to establish such rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate for proper administration of the Plan and to make such determinations under, and issue such interpretations of, the Plan and any outstanding options thereunder as it may deem necessary or advisable. Decisions of the Plan Administrator shall be final and binding on all parties who have an interest in the Plan or any option thereunder. The Plan Administrator may delegate to one or more officers of the Company the authority to grant an Option under this Plan to Participants 

^^^^^ 
who are not Insiders of the Company. No member of the Plan Administrator shall be personally liable for any action taken or decision made in good faith relating to this Plan, and all members of the Plan Administrator shall be fully protected and indemnified to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law by the Company in respect to any such action, determination, or interpretation. 

^ELIGIBILITY  

^The persons eligible to participate in the Plan are as follows: 

^^Employees,  

^^non-employee members of the Board or the non-employee members of the board of directors of any Parent or Subsidiary, and 

^^consultants and other independent advisors who provide services to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary). 

^The Plan Administrator shall have full authority to determine, (i) with respect to the option grants under the Option Grant Program, which eligible persons are to receive option grants, the time or times when such option grants are to be made, the number of shares to be covered by each such grant, the status of the granted option as either an Incentive Option or a Non-Statutory Option, the time or times at which each option is to become exercisable, the vesting schedule (if any) applicable to the option shares and the maximum term for which the option is to remain outstanding, and (ii) with respect to stock issuances under the Stock Issuance Program, which eligible persons are to receive stock issuances, the time or times when such issuances are to be made, the number of shares to be issued to each Participant, the vesting schedule (if any) applicable to the issued shares and the consideration to be paid by the Participant for such shares. 

^The Plan Administrator shall have the absolute discretion either to grant options in accordance with the Option Grant Program or to effect stock issuances in accordance with the Stock Issuance Program. 

^STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN  

^The stock issuable under the Plan shall be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued over the term of the Plan shall not exceed six million five hundred thousand (6,500,000) shares. 

^Shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options shall be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan to the extent (i) the options expire or terminate for any reason prior to exercise in full or (ii) the options are cancelled in accordance with the cancellation-regrant provisions of Section II. Unvested shares issued under the Plan and subsequently repurchased by the Corporation, at the option exercise price paid per share, pursuant to the Corporation’s repurchase rights under the Plan shall be added back to the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan and shall accordingly be available for reissuance through one or more subsequent option grants or direct stock issuances under the Plan. 

^Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation’s receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be 

^^^^^ 
made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan and (ii) the number and/or class of securities and the exercise price per share in effect under each outstanding option in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of benefits thereunder. The adjustments determined by the Plan Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive. In no event shall any such adjustments be made in connection with the conversion of one or more outstanding shares of the Corporation’s preferred stock into shares of Common Stock. 

^^^**OPTION GRANT PROGRAM**  

^OPTION TERMS  

Each option shall be evidenced by one or more documents in the form approved by the Plan Administrator; provided, however, that each such document shall comply with the terms specified below. Each document evidencing an Incentive Option shall, in addition, be subject to the provisions of the Plan applicable to such options. 

^**Exercise Price**.  

^^The exercise price per share shall be fixed by the Plan Administrator in accordance with the following provisions: 

^^^The exercise price per share shall not be less than eighty-five percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the option grant date. 

^^^If the person to whom the option is granted is a [[Percentage 2: Number]]% Shareholder, then the exercise price per share shall not be less than one hundred ten percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the option grant date. 

^^The exercise price shall become immediately due upon exercise of the option and shall, subject to the provisions of Section IV.A and the documents evidencing the option, be payable in cash, cancellation of indebtedness of the Company to the Participant, waiver of compensation for services rendered (to the extent permitted under applicable law) or check made payable to the Corporation. Should the Common Stock be registered under Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act at the time the option is exercised, then the exercise price may also be paid as follows: 

^^^in shares of Common Stock held for the requisite period necessary to avoid a charge to the Corporation’s earnings for financial reporting purposes and valued at Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date, or 

^^^to the extent the option is exercised for vested shares, through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which the Optionee shall concurrently provide irrevocable written instructions (A) to a Corporation-designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of the purchased shares and remit to the Corporation, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased shares plus all applicable Federal, state and local income and employment taxes required to be withheld by the Corporation by reason of such exercise and (B) to the Corporation to deliver the certificates for the purchased shares directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale. 

^^^^^ 
Except to the extent such sale and remittance procedure is utilized, payment of the exercise price for the purchased shares must be made on the Exercise Date. 

^**Exercise and Term of Options**. Each option shall be exercisable at such time or times, during such period and for such number of shares as shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the documents evidencing the option grant. However, no option shall have a term in excess of ten (10) years measured from the option grant date. 

^**Effect of Termination of Service**.  

^^The following provisions shall govern the exercise of any options held by the Optionee at the time of cessation of Service or death: 

^^^Should the Optionee cease to remain in Service for any reason other than Disability or death, then the Optionee shall have a period of three (3) months following the date of such cessation of Service during which to exercise each outstanding option held by such Optionee. 

^^^Should Optionee’s Service terminate by reason of Disability, then the Optionee shall have a period of twelve (12) months following the date of such cessation of Service during which to exercise each outstanding option held by such Optionee. 

^^^If the Optionee dies while holding an outstanding option, then the personal representative of his or her estate or the person or persons to whom the option is transferred pursuant to the Optionee’s will or the laws of inheritance shall have a twelve (12)-month period following the date of the Optionee’s death to exercise such option. 

^^^Under no circumstances, however, shall any such option be exercisable after the specified expiration of the option term. 

^^During the applicable post-Service exercise period, the option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of vested shares for which the option is exercisable on the date of the Optionee’s cessation of Service. Upon the expiration of the applicable exercise period or (if earlier) upon the expiration of the option term, the option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any vested shares for which the option has not been exercised. However, the option shall, immediately upon the Optionee’s cessation of Service, terminate and cease to be outstanding with respect to any and all option shares for which the option is not otherwise at the time exercisable or in which the Optionee is not otherwise at that time vested. 

^^The Plan Administrator shall have the discretion, exercisable either at the time an option is granted or at any time while the option remains outstanding, to: 

^^^extend the period of time for which the option is to remain exercisable following Optionee’s cessation of Service or death from the limited period otherwise in effect for that option to such greater period of time as the Plan Administrator shall deem appropriate, but in no event beyond the expiration of the option term; and/or 

^^^permit the option to be exercised, during the applicable post-Service exercise period, not only with respect to the number of vested shares of Common Stock for which such 

^^^^^ 
option is exercisable at the time of the Optionee’s cessation of Service but also with respect to one or more additional installments in which the Optionee would have vested under the option had the Optionee continued in Service. 

^**Shareholder Rights**. The holder of an option shall have no shareholder rights with respect to the shares subject to the option until such person shall have exercised the option, paid the exercise price and become a holder of record of the purchased shares. 

^**Unvested Option Shares**. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretion to grant options which are exercisable for unvested shares of Common Stock (“Unvested Option Shares”). Should the Optionee cease Service while holding such Unvested Option Shares, the Corporation shall have the right to repurchase, at the exercise price paid per share, all or (at the discretion of the Corporation and with the consent of the Optionee) any of those Unvested Option Shares. The terms upon which such repurchase right shall be exercisable (including the period and procedure for exercise and the appropriate vesting schedule for the purchased shares) shall be established by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the document evidencing such repurchase right. The Plan Administrator may not impose a vesting schedule upon any option grant or any shares of Common Stock subject to the option which is more restrictive than twenty percent ([[Percentage 4: Number]]%) per year vesting, with the initial vesting to occur not later than one (1) year after the option grant date. 

^**First Refusal Rights**. Until such time as the Common Stock is first registered under Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act, the Corporation shall have the right of first refusal with respect to any proposed disposition by the Optionee (or any successor in interest) of any shares of Common Stock issued under the Plan. Such right of first refusal shall be exercisable in accordance with the terms established by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the document evidencing such right. 

^**Limited Transferability of Options**. During the lifetime of the Optionee, the option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee and shall not be assignable or transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution following the Optionee’s death. 

^**Withholding**. The Corporation’s obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of any options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the satisfaction of all applicable Federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding requirements. 

^INCENTIVE OPTIONS  

The terms specified below shall be applicable to all Incentive Options. Except as modified by the provisions of this Section B, all the provisions of the Plan shall be applicable to Incentive Options. Options which are specifically designated as Non-Statutory Options shall not be subject to the terms of this Section B. 

^**Eligibility**. Incentive Options may only be granted to Employees. 

^**Exercise Price**. The exercise price per share shall not be less than one hundred percent ([[Percentage 5: Number]]%) of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the option grant date. 

^**Dollar Limitation**. The aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock (determined as of the respective date or dates of grant) for which one or more options granted to any Employee under the Plan (or any other option plan of the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary) may for the first time 

^^^^^ 
become exercisable as Incentive Options during any one (1) calendar year shall not exceed the sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]). If the Fair Market Value of shares on the date of grant with respect to which Incentive Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year exceeds $[[USD Value 2: Number]] then the Options for the first $[[USD Value 1]] worth of shares to become exercisable in such calendar year will be Incentive Options and the Options for the amount in excess of $[[USD Value 1]] that become exercisable in that calendar year will be Non-Statutory Options. In the event that the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder are amended after the Effective Date of this Plan to provide for a different limit on the Fair Market Value of shares permitted to be subject to Incentive Options, such different limit will be automatically incorporated herein and will apply to any Options granted after the effective date of such amendment. To the extent the Employee holds two (2) or more such options which become exercisable for the first time in the same calendar year, the foregoing limitation on the exercisability of such options as Incentive Options shall be applied on the basis of the order in which such options are granted. 

^[[Percentage 2]]% Shareholder. If any Employee to whom an Incentive Option is granted is a [[Percentage 2]]% Shareholder, then the option term shall not exceed five (5) years measured from the option grant date. 

^**Modification, Extension or Renewal**. The Plan Administrator may modify, extend or renew outstanding Options and authorize the grant of new Options in substitution therefore, provided that any such action may not, without the written consent of a Participant, impair any of such Participant’s rights under any Option previously granted. Any outstanding ISO that is modified, extended, renewed or otherwise altered will be treated in accordance with Section 424(h) of the Code. The Plan Administrator may reduce the Exercise Price of outstanding Options without the consent of Participants affected by a written notice to them; provided, however, that the Exercise Price may not be reduced below the minimum Exercise Price that would be permitted under Section 6.4 of this Plan for Options granted on the date the action is taken to reduce the Exercise Price. 

^**No Disqualification**. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, no term of this Plan relating to Incentive Options will be interpreted, amended or altered, nor will any discretion or authority granted under this Plan be exercised, so as to disqualify this Plan under Section 422 of the Code or, without the consent of the Participant affected, to disqualify any ISO under Section 422 of the Code. 

^CORPORATE TRANSACTION  

^The Plan and each option outstanding under the Plan at the time of a Corporate Transaction shall terminate and cease to be outstanding. However, the outstanding options shall not terminate and cease to be outstanding if and to the extent such options are assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in the Corporate Transaction. 

^Each option which is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after such Corporate Transaction, to apply to the number and class of securities which would have been issuable to the Optionee in consummation of such Corporate Transaction, had the option been exercised immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction. Appropriate adjustments shall also be made to (i) the number and class of securities available for issuance under the Plan following the consummation of such Corporate Transaction and (ii) the exercise price payable per share under each outstanding option, provided the aggregate exercise price payable for such securities shall remain the same. 

^The Plan Administrator shall have the discretion, exercisable either at the time the option is granted or at any time while the option remains outstanding, to provide for the automatic acceleration (in 

^^^^^ 
whole or in part) of one or more outstanding options or Unvested Option Shares (and the automatic termination of one or more outstanding repurchase rights, with the immediate vesting of the shares of Common Stock subject to those terminated rights) upon the occurrence of a Corporate Transaction, whether or not those options or Unvested Option Shares are to be assumed or replaced in the Corporate Transaction. 

^The Plan Administrator shall also have full power and authority, exercisable either at the time the option is granted or at any time while the option remains outstanding, to structure such option so that the shares subject to that option will automatically vest on an accelerated basis should the Optionee’s Service terminate by reason of an Involuntary Termination within a period designated by the Plan Administrator following the effective date of any Corporate Transaction in which the option is assumed and the repurchase rights applicable to those shares do not otherwise terminate. Any such option shall remain exercisable for the fully-vested option shares until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the option term or (ii) the expiration of the one (1)-year period measured from the effective date of the Involuntary Termination, or for such other period of time as the Plan Administrator may designate. In addition, the Plan Administrator may provide that one or more of the outstanding repurchase rights with respect to shares held by the Optionee at the time of such Involuntary Termination shall immediately terminate on an accelerated basis, and the shares subject to those terminated rights shall accordingly vest. 

^The portion of any Incentive Option accelerated in connection with a Corporate Transaction shall remain exercisable as an Incentive Option only to the extent the applicable One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($[[USD Value 1]]) limitation is not exceeded. To the extent such dollar limitation is exceeded, the accelerated portion of such option shall be exercisable as a Non-Statutory Option under the Federal tax laws. 

^The grant of options under the Plan shall in no way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 

^CANCELLATION AND REGRANT OF OPTIONS  

The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to effect, at any time and from time to time, with the consent of the affected option holders, the cancellation of any or all outstanding options under the Plan and to grant in substitution therefor new options covering the same or different number of shares of Common Stock but with an exercise price per share based on the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the new option grant date. 

^^^**STOCK ISSUANCE PROGRAM**  

^STOCK ISSUANCE TERMS  

Shares of Common Stock may be issued under the Stock Issuance Program through direct and immediate issuances without any intervening option grants. Each such stock issuance shall be evidenced by a Stock Issuance Agreement which complies with the terms specified below. 

^**Purchase Price****.**  

^^The purchase price per share shall be fixed by the Plan Administrator but shall not be less than eighty-five percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the issue date. 

^^^^^ 
However, the purchase price per share of Common Stock issued to a [[Percentage 2]]% Shareholder shall not be less than one hundred and ten percent ([[Percentage 3]]%) of such Fair Market Value. 

^^Subject to the provisions of Section IV.A, shares of Common Stock may be issued under the Stock Issuance Program for any of the following items of consideration which the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate in each individual instance: 

^^^cash or check made payable to the Corporation, or 

^^^past services rendered to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary). 

^**Vesting Provisions****.**  

^^Shares of Common Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program may, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be fully and immediately vested upon issuance or may vest in one or more installments over the Participant’s period of Service or upon attainment of specified performance objectives. However, the Plan Administrator may not impose a vesting schedule upon any stock issuance effected under the Stock Issuance Program which is more restrictive than twenty percent ([[Percentage 4]]%) per year vesting, with initial vesting to occur not later than one (1) year after the issuance date. 

^^Any new, substituted or additional securities or other property (including money paid other than as a regular cash dividend) which the Participant may have the right to receive with respect to the Participant’s unvested shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation’s receipt of consideration shall be issued subject to (i) the same vesting requirements applicable to the Participant’s unvested shares of Common Stock and (ii) such escrow arrangements as the Plan Administrator shall deem appropriate. 

^^The Participant shall have full shareholder rights with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued to the Participant under the Stock Issuance Program, whether or not the Participant’s interest in those shares is vested. Accordingly, the Participant shall have the right to vote such shares and to receive any regular cash dividends paid on such shares. 

^^Should the Participant cease to remain in Service while holding one or more unvested shares of Common Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program or should the performance objectives not be attained with respect to one or more such unvested shares of Common Stock, then those shares shall be immediately surrendered to the Corporation for cancellation, and the Participant shall have no further shareholder rights with respect to those shares. To the extent the surrendered shares were previously issued to the Participant for consideration paid in cash or cash equivalent (including the Participant’s purchase-money indebtedness), the Corporation shall repay to the Participant the cash consideration paid for the surrendered shares and shall cancel the unpaid principal balance of any outstanding purchase-money note of the Participant attributable to such surrendered shares. 

^^The Plan Administrator may in its discretion waive the surrender and cancellation of one or more unvested shares of Common Stock (or other assets attributable thereto) which would otherwise occur upon the non-completion of the vesting schedule applicable to such shares. Such waiver shall result in the immediate vesting of the Participant’s interest in the shares of Common Stock as to which the waiver 

^^^^^ 
applies. Such waiver may be effected at any time, whether before or after the Participant’s cessation of Service or the attainment or non-attainment of the applicable performance objectives. 

^**First Refusal Rights****.** Until such time as the Common Stock is first registered under Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act, the Corporation shall have the right of first refusal with respect to any proposed disposition by the Participant (or any successor in interest) of any shares of Common Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program. Such right of first refusal shall be exercisable in accordance with the terms established by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the document evidencing such right. 

^CORPORATE TRANSACTION  

^Upon the occurrence of a Corporate Transaction all unvested shares not assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) shall be immediately surrendered to the Corporation for cancellation, and the Participant shall have no further shareholder rights with respect to those shares. To the extent the surrendered shares were previously issued to the Participant for consideration paid in cash or cash equivalent (including the Participant’s purchase-money indebtedness), the Corporation shall repay to the Participant the cash consideration paid for the surrendered shares and shall cancel the unpaid principal balance of any outstanding purchase-money note of the Participant attributable to such surrendered shares. 

^The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority, exercisable either at the time the unvested shares are issued or any time while the Corporation’s repurchase rights with respect to those shares remaining outstanding, to provide that those rights shall automatically terminate on an accelerated basis, and the shares of Common Stock subject to those terminated rights shall immediately vest, in the event of a Corporate Transaction or in the event that the Participant’s Service should subsequently terminate by reason of an Involuntary Termination within a period designated by the Plan Administrator following the effective date of any Corporate Transaction in which those repurchase rights are assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof). 

^SHARE ESCROW/LEGENDS  

Unvested shares may, in the Plan Administrator’s discretion, be held in escrow by the Corporation until the Participant’s interest in such shares vests or may be issued directly to the Participant with restrictive legends on the certificates evidencing those unvested shares. 

^^^**MISCELLANEOUS**  

^FINANCING  

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan Administrator may permit any Optionee or Participant to pay the option exercise price or the purchase price for shares issued to such person under the Plan by delivering a full-recourse, interest-bearing promissory note payable in one or more installments and secured by the purchased shares. In no event shall the maximum credit available to the Optionee or Participant exceed the sum of (i) the aggregate option exercise price or purchase price payable for the purchased shares plus (ii) any Federal, state and local income and employment tax liability incurred by the Optionee or the Participant in connection with the option exercise or share purchase. 

^EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF PLAN  

^^^^^ 
^This Plan will become effective on the date on which it is adopted by the Board (the “Effective Date”). Upon the Effective Date, the Committee may grant Options and Shares pursuant to the Plan. The Company intends to seek stockholder approval of the Plan within twelve (12) months after the date this Plan is adopted by the Board; provided, however, if the Company fails to obtain stockholder approval of the Plan during such 12-month period, pursuant to Section 422 of the Code, any Option granted as an Incentive Option at any time under the Plan will not qualify as an ISO within the meaning of the Code and will be deemed to be an Non-Statutory Option. 

^The Plan shall terminate upon the earliest of (i) the expiration of the ten (10)-year period measured from the date the Plan is adopted by the Board, (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Plan shall have been issued or (iii) the termination of all outstanding options in connection with a Corporate Transaction. All options and unvested stock issuances outstanding at that time under the Plan shall continue to have full force and effect in accordance with the provisions of the documents evidencing such options or issuances. 

^AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN  

^The Board shall have complete and exclusive power and authority to amend or modify the Plan in any or all respects. However, no such amendment or modification shall adversely affect the rights and obligations with respect to options or unvested stock issuances at the time outstanding under the Plan unless the Optionee or the Participant consents to such amendment or modification. In addition, certain amendments may require shareholder approval pursuant to applicable laws and regulations. 

^Options may be granted under the Option Grant Program and shares may be issued under the Stock Issuance Program which are in each instance in excess of the number of shares of Common Stock then available for issuance under the Plan, provided any excess shares actually issued under those programs shall be held in escrow until there is obtained shareholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan. If such shareholder approval is not obtained within twelve (12) months after the date the first such excess issuances are made, then (i) any unexercised options granted on the basis of such excess shares shall terminate and cease to be outstanding and (ii) the Corporation shall promptly refund to the Optionees and the Participants the exercise or purchase price paid for any excess shares issued under the Plan and held in escrow, together with interest (at the applicable Short Term Federal Rate) for the period the shares were held in escrow, and such shares shall thereupon be automatically cancelled and cease to be outstanding.

Any cash proceeds received by the Corporation from the sale of shares of Common Stock under the Plan shall be used for general corporate purposes. 

^WITHHOLDING

^REGULATORY APPROVALS  

^^^^^ 
The implementation of the Plan, the granting of any options under the Plan and the issuance of any shares of Common Stock (i) upon the exercise of any option or (ii) under the Stock Issuance Program shall be subject to the Corporation’s procurement of all approvals and permits required by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Plan, the options granted under it and the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to it. 

^NO EMPLOYMENT OR SERVICE RIGHTS  

Nothing in the Plan shall confer upon the Optionee or the Participant any right to continue in Service for any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining such person) or of the Optionee or the Participant, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate such person’s Service at any time for any reason, with or without cause. 

^FINANCIAL REPORTS  

The Corporation shall deliver a balance sheet and an income statement at least annually to each individual holding an outstanding option under the Plan, unless such individual is a key Employee whose duties in connection with the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary) assure such individual access to equivalent information.
