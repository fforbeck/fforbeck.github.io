Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the grant of Options permitting exercise in excess of the maximums established hereby where such excess amount is treated as a Nonstatutory Option.

^^**Certain Grant Limitations**. The following limitations shall apply to grants of Awards under this Plan:

^^No individual Grantee shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the Company, Awards with respect to more than [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of Stock in total.

^^The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 5.3.

^^If an Award is cancelled in the same fiscal year of the Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Article XVI), the cancelled Award will be counted against the limits set forth in Sections 6.2(a) and (b) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option and the grant of a new Option.

^^For purposes of the limits in Sections 6.2(a) and (b) above, any shares subject to an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units will be multiplied by 1.5.

^^**Duration of the Plan**. The Plan shall be in effect until [[Date 2: Date]]. Any Awards outstanding at the end of such period shall remain in effect in accordance with their terms.

^^**Grant of Options**. Subject to Section 5.1 and Article VI, Options may be granted to Employees, Directors or Consultants at any time and from time to time as determined by the Committee; provided, however, that Directors and Consultants may receive only Nonstatutory Options and may not receive Incentive Stock Options. The Committee shall have complete discretion in determining the number of Options granted to each Grantee. In making such determinations, the Committee may take into account the nature of services rendered by such Employee or Consultant, their present and potential contributions to the Company, and such other factors as the Committee in its discretion shall deem relevant. The Committee shall also determi ne whether an Option is to be an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Option.

^^**No Tandem Options**. Where an Option granted under this Plan is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option, the Option shall not contain terms pursuant to which the exercise of the Option would affect the Grantee's right to exercise another Option, or vice versa, such that the Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option would be deemed a tandem stock option within the meaning of the regulations under Section 422 of the Code.

^^**Option Agreement; Terms and Conditions to Apply Unless Otherwise Specified**. As determined by the Committee on the date of grant, each Option shall be evidenced by an Option agreement (the "Option Agreement") that includes the nontransferability provisions required by Section 14.2 hereof and specifies: whether the Option is an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Option; the Option price; the duration of the Option; the number of shares of Stock to which the Option applies; any vesting or exercisability restrictions which the Committee may impose; in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, a provision implementing the $[[USD Value 3]] Limitation; and any other terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant of the Option.

All Option Agreements shall incorporate the provisions of this Plan by reference, with certain provisions to apply depending upon whether the Option Agreement applies to an Incentive Stock Option or to a Nonstatutory Option.

^^**Option Price**. No Option granted pursuant to this Plan shall have an Option price that is less than the Fair Market Value of Stock on the date the Option is granted. Incentive Stock Options granted to Significant Stockholders shall have an Option price of not less than 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of Stock on the date of grant.

^^**Term of Options**. Each Option shall expire at such time as the Committee shall determine when it is granted, provided, however, that no Option shall be exerciseable later than the tenth anniversary date of its grant.

^^**Exercise of Options**. Options granted under this Plan shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee shall in each instance approve, which need not be the same for all Grantees.

^^**Payment**. Payment for all shares of Stock shall be made at the time that an Option, or any part thereof, is exercised, and no shares shall be issued until full payment therefor has been made. Such payment may be made in cash, outstanding shares of Stock, in combinations thereof, or any other method of payment approved by the Committee; provided, however, that (i) the deposit of any withholding tax shall be made in accordance with applicable law and (ii) that such shares of Stock used to pay the exercise price have been held by the Grantee for at least six months prior to the exercise date. If shares of Stock are being used in part or full payment for the shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Option, such shares shall be va lued for the purpose of such exchange as of the date of exercise of the Option at the Fair Market Value of the shares. Any certificates evidencing shares of Stock used to pay the purchase price shall be accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank by the registered holder of the certificate (with signatures thereon guaranteed). In the event the certificates tendered by the holder in such payment cover more shares than are required for such payment, the certificate shall also be accompanied by instructions from the holder to the Company's transfer agent with regard to the disposition of the balance of the shares covered thereby.

^^**Prohibition on Repricing**. Except for adjustments pursuant to Section 5.3 and Article XVI, the per share Option price for any Option granted pursuant to this Plan may not be decreased after the date of grant nor may an outstanding Option be surrendered to the Company as consideration for the grant of a new Option with a lower Option price without the approval of the Company's stockholders.

^^**Death**. If a Grantee's employment in the case of an Employee, or provision of services as a Director or Consultant in the case of a Director or Consultant, terminates by reason of death, the Option may thereafter be exercised at any time prior to the expiration date of the Option or within 12 months after the date of such death, whichever period is the shorter, by the person or persons entitled to do so under the Grantee's will or, if the Grantee shall fail to make a testamentary disposition of an Option or shall die intestate, the Grantee's legal representative or representatives. The Option shall be exercisable only to the extent that such Option was exercisabl e as of the date of death, provided that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, at any time before or after the date of death accelerate the vesting of any such Option to be exercisable in whole or in part as of the date of death.

^^**Termination Other Than for Cause or Due to Death**.

The Committee may condition the grant of Restricted Stock upon the attainment of specified Performance Goals or such other factors or criteria as the Committee shall determine.

If applicable, a Stock Appreciation Right may not be exercised for a fraction of a share.

^^A Stock Appreciation Right shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Stock Appreciation Right Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right. If applicable, shares issued upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be issued in the name of the Grantee or, if requested by the Grantee, in the name of the Grantee and his or her spouse. If applicable, until the shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Stock subject to the Stock Appreciation Right, notwithstanding the exercise of the Stock Appr eciation Right. If applicable, the Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such shares promptly after the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised, and the Company shall not permit a Grantee to defer receipt of such shares following exercise.

^^**Prohibition on Repricing**. Except for adjustments pursuant to Section 5.3 and Article XVI, the per share exercise price for any Stock Appreciation Right granted pursuant to this Plan may not be decreased after the date of grant nor may an outstanding Stock Appreciation Right be surrendered to the Company as consideration for the grant of a new Stock Appreciation Right with a lower exercise price without the approval of the Company's stockholders.

^^**Privileges of a Stockholder**. A Grantee or any other person entitled to exercise a Stock Appreciation Right under this Plan shall not have stockholder privileges with respect to any Stock covered by the Stock Appreciation Right until the date of issuance of a stock certificate for such Stock.

^^**Termination of Employment or Services**. Except as otherwise expressly specified by the Committee, all Stock Appreciation Rights granted under this Plan shall be subject to the following termination provisions.

^^**Death**. If a Grantee's employment in the case of an Employee, or provision of services as a Director or Consultant in the case of a Director or Consultant, terminates by reason of death, the Stock Appreciation Right may thereafter be exercised at any time prior to the expiration date of the Stock Appreciation Right or within 12 months after the date of such death, whichever period is the shorter, by the person or persons entitled to do so under the Grantee's will or, if the Grantee shall fail to make a testamentary disposition of a Stock Appreciation Right or shall die intestate, the Grantee's legal representative or representatives. The Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable only to the extent that such Stock Appreciation Rig ht was exercisable as of the date of death, provided that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, at any time before or after the date of death accelerate the vesting of any such Stock Appreciation Right to be exercisable in whole or in part as of the date of death.

^^**Termination Other Than for Cause or Due to Death**. In the event of a Grantee's termination of employment in the case of an Employee, or termination of the provision of services as a Director or Consultant in the case of a Director or Consultant, other than for Cause or by reason of death, the Grantee may exercise such portion of his Stock Appreciation Right as was exercisable by him at the date of such termination (the "Termination Date") at any time within three months of the Termination Date; provided, however, that where the Grantee is an Employee, and is terminated due to disability within the meaning of Code Section 422, he may exercise such portion of his Stock Appreciation Right as was exercisable by him on his Termination Date within on e year of his Termination Date. In any event, the Stock Appreciation Right cannot be exercised after the expiration of the original term of the Stock Appreciation Right. Stock Appreciation Rights not exercised within the applicable period specified above shall terminate.

In the case of an Employee, a change of duties or position within the Company, if any, shall not be considered a termination of employment for purposes of this Plan. The Stock Appreciation Right Agreements may contain such provisions as the Committee shall approve with respect to the effect of approved leaves of absence upon termination of employment.

^^**Termination for Cause**. In the event of a Grantee's termination of employment in the case of an Employee, or termination of the provision of services as a Director or Consultant in the case of a Director or Consultant, which termination is by the Company for Cause, any Stock Appreciation Right or Stock Appreciation Rights held by him under the Plan, to the extent not exercised before such termination, shall forthwith terminate.

^^**Grant of Performance-Based Awards**. To the extent permitted by Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee is authorized to design any Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units so that the shares of Stock issuable pursuant to such Award are treated as "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and related regulations.

^^**Establishment of Performance Goals for Covered Employees**. No later than the end of the Establishment Period for any Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee shall establish in writing: (a) the Performance Goals applicable to the Performance Period; (b) the targets to be used to measure the Performance Goals in terms of an objective formula or standard; (c) the Award Formula for computing the amount of compensation payable to the Grantee if such Performance Goals are obtained; and (d) the Grantee or class of Grantees to which such Performance Goals apply. The outcome of such Performance Goals must be substantially uncertain when the Committee establishes the Performance Goals.

^^**Adjustment of Performance-Based Compensation**. Awards that are designed to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation may not be adjusted upward. The Committee shall retain the discretion to adjust such Awards downward, either on a formula or discretionary basis or any combination thereof, as the Committee determines.

^^**Certification of Performance**. Except for Awards that pay compensation attributable solely to an increase in the value of Stock, no Award designed to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation shall be vested, credited or paid, as applicable, with respect to any Grantee until the Committee certifies in writing that the Performance Goals and any other material terms applicable to such Performance Period have been satisfied.

^^**Terms of Performance-Based Awards**. For each Award of Performance-Based Compensation to a Covered Employee under the Plan, prior to the expiration of the applicable Establishment Period, the terms of such Award shall be established in a written agreement which sets forth the applicable Performance Period, Performance Measure(s), Performance Goal(s), Award Formula(s), and such other information as the Committee may determine. Once established for a Performance Period, such items shall not be amended or otherwise modified.

^^**Code Section 162(m)**. It is the intent of the Company that all Awards of Performance-Based Compensation made to any Covered Employee satisfy the applicable requirements of "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m) so that the Company's tax deduction for remuneration in respect of this Plan for services performed by Covered Employees is not disallowed in whole or in part by the operation of such Code section. If any provision of this Plan or if any Award would otherwise frustrate or conflict with such intent, that provision to the extent possible shall be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid such conflict, and, to the extent of any remaining irreconcilable conflict with such intent, that provision shall be deemed void as applicable to such Covered Employees.

^^**Impact of Event**. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in Section 13.2), the Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion (or, if required pursuant to any Grantee's written employment agreement, the Committee shall for such Grantee), cause (a) any Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred and not then exercisable and vested to become fully exercisable and vested to the full extent of the original grant, (b) all restrictions applicable to any Restricted Stock to lapse and such Restricted Stock to become free of all restrictions and fully vested to the full extent of the original gran t and/or (c) all restrictions or other conditions to the delivery of shares of Stock pursuant to any Restricted Stock Units to lapse and such shares to become deliverable to the full extent of the original grant.

^^**Definition of Change of Control**. For purposes of the Plan, a "Change of Control" shall mean the happening of any of the following events:

^^the acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of [[Percentage 2: Number]]% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of Company (the "Outstanding Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of Company entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors (the "Outstanding Voting Securities"); provided, however, that the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control: (i) any acquisition directly from Company, (ii) any acquisition by Company, (iii) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by Company or any corpora tion controlled by Company or (iv) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which complies with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 13.2(c); or

^^individuals who, as of [[Date 3: Date]], constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a Director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by Company's stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the Directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of Directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or

^^the consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company (a “Business Combination”), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (i) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Common Stock and Outstanding Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns Company through o ne or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Common Stock and Outstanding Voting Securities, as the case may be, (ii) no Person (excluding any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, [[Percentage 2]]% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the approval of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or

^^the consummation of (i) a complete liquidation or dissolution of Company or (ii) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Company, other than to a corporation, with respect to which following such sale or other disposition, [a] more than [[Percentage 3]]% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Common Stock and Outstanding Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or other disposition in substantially the same proportion as their ownership, immediately prior to such sale or other disposition, of the Outstanding Common Stock and Outstanding Voting Securities, as the case may be, [b] less than [[Percentage 2]]% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any Person (excluding any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of Company or such corporation), except to the extent that such Person owned [[Percentage 2]]% or more of the Outstanding Common Stock or Outstanding Voting Securities prior to the sale or disposition, and [c] at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of such corporation were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the approval of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board of Directors, providing for such sale or other disposition of assets of Company or wer e elected, appointed or nominated by the Board.

^^**Service**. Nothing in this Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate any Employee's employment, or any Director's or Consultant's services, at any time, nor confer upon any Employee any right to continue in the employ of the Company, or upon any Director or Consultant any right to continue to provide services to the Company.

^^**Nontransferability**. Options, Restricted Stock Units and Stock Appreciation Rights granted under this Plan shall be nontransferable by the Grantee, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercisable during the Grantee's lifetime only by the Grantee.

\centered **and Termination of the Plan**

^^**Amendment, Modification, and Termination of the Plan.**

The Board may at any time terminate and from time to time may amend or modify the Plan. The Company shall obtain the approval of the stockholders to any amendment to this Plan to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable laws or the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which the Stock is listed or quoted. No amendment, modification or termination of the Plan shall in any manner adversely affect any outstanding Award under the Plan without the consent of the Grantee holding the Award.

^^**Acquisition**. Notwithstanding anything herein to contrary, in the event that an Acquisition (as defined below) occurs with respect to the Company, the Company shall have the option, but not the obligation, to (a) cancel Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the effective date of Acquisition, whether or not such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights are then exercisable, in return for payment to the Grantees for each Option and Stock Appreciation Right of an amount equal to a reasonable, good faith estimate of an amount (hereinafter the "Spread") equal to the difference between the net amount per share payable in the Acquisition, or as a result of the Acquisition, less the exercise price per share of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right and/or (b) cancel Restricted Stock Units outstand ing as of the effective date of Acquisition, whether or not the restrictions or other conditions to the delivery of shares of Stock pursuant to such Restricted Stock Units have lapsed, in return for payment to the Grantees for each Restricted Stock Unit of an amount equal to a reasonable, good faith estimate of an amount equal to the net amount per share payable in the Acquisition or as a result of the Acquisition (the "RSU Value"). In estimating the Spread and the RSU Value, as applicable, appropriate adjustments to give effect to the existence of the Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Units may be made, such as deeming the Options and Stock Appreciation Rights to have been exercised and the shares of Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Units to have been issued, with the Company receiving the exercise price payable under the Options, and treating the shares receivable upon exercise of the Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Units as being outstanding in determining the net amount per share. For purposes of this section, an "Acquisition" shall mean any transaction in which substantially all of the Company's assets are acquired or in which a controlling amount of the Company's outstanding shares are acquired, in each case by a single person or entity or an affiliated group of persons and/or entities. For purposes of this section a controlling amount shall mean more than [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the Company. The Company shall have such an option regardless of how the Acquisition is effectuated, whether by direct purchase, through a merger or similar corporate transaction, or otherwise.

In cases where the Acquisition consists of the acquisition of assets of the Company, the net amount per share shall be calculated on the basis of the net amount receivable with respect to shares upon a distribution and liquidation by the Company after giving effect to expenses and charges, including but not limited to taxes, payable by the Company before the liquidation can be completed.

Where the Company does not exercise its option under this Section 16.1, the remaining provisions of this Article XVI shall apply, to the extent applicable.

^^**Merger or Consolidation**. Subject to Section 16.1 and to any required action by the stockholders, if the Company shall be the surviving corporation in any merger or consolidation, any Option, Restricted Stock Units or Stock Appreciation Right granted hereunder shall pertain to and apply to the securities to which a holder of the number of shares of Stock subject to the Option, Restricted Stock Units or Stock Appreciation Right would have been entitled in such merger or consolidation.

^^**Other Transactions**. Subject to Section 16.1, dissolution or a liquidation of the Company or a merger and consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation shall cause every Option, Restricted Stock Unit and Stock Appreciation Right outstanding hereunder to terminate as of the effective date of the dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation. However, the Grantee either (i) shall be offered a firm commitment whereby the resulting or surviving corporation in a merger or consolidation will tender to the Grantee an option, restricted stock unit or stock appreciation right, as applicable (the "Substitute Award") on terms and conditions both as to number of shares and otherwise, which will substantially preserve t o the Grantee the rights and benefits of the Option, Restricted Stock Unit or Stock Appreciation Right outstanding hereunder granted by the Company, or (ii) shall have the right immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation, merger, or consolidation to exercise any unexercised Options and Stock Appreciation Rights whether or not then exercisable, and to receive the shares of Stock subject to any Restricted Stock Units, subject to the provisions of this Plan. The Committee shall have absolute and uncontrolled discretion to determine whether the Grantee has been offered a firm commitment and whether the tendered Substitute Award will substantially preserve to the Grantee the rights and benefits of the Options, Restricted Stock Units and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding hereunder. In any event, any Substitute Award for an Incentive Stock Option shall comply with the requirements of the Code.

^^**Securities Registration**. In the event that the Company shall deem it necessary or desirable to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any other applicable statute, any Awards or any Stock with respect to which an Award may be or shall have been granted or exercised, or to qualify any such Awards or Stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any other statute, then the Grantee shall cooperate with the Company and take such action as is necessary to permit registration or qualification of such Awards or Stock.

Unless the Company has determined that the following representation is unnecessary, each person exercising an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or receiving an Award of Restricted Stock under the Plan may be required by the Company, as a condition to the issuance of the shares pursuant to exercise of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right or Award, to make a representation in writing (a) that he is acquiring such shares for his own account for investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, the distribution of any part thereof, and (b) that before any transfer in connection with the resale of such shares, he will obtain the written opinion of counsel to the Company, or other counsel acceptable to the Company, that such shares may be transferred. The Company may also require that the certificates representin g such shares contain legends reflecting the foregoing.

^^**Tax Withholding**. Whenever shares of Stock, cash or other property are to be issued in satisfaction of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights exercised under this Plan or pursuant to an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, the Company shall have the power to require the recipient of the Stock, cash or other property to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local withholding tax requirements. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, withholding obligations may be settled with Stock, including Stock that is part of the Award that gives rise to the withholding requirement. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and th e Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the Grantee. The maximum number of shares that a Grantee may use toward satisfying the withholding reimbursement shall not exceed the minimum funding required for the withholding. Where a Grantee's withholding reimbursement obligation arises by reason of the Grantee's election under Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to the Award, the Grantee may not remit unvested shares in satisfaction of the Grantee's withholding reimbursement obligation.

^^**Indemnification**. To the extent permitted by law, each person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he may be a party or in which he may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him in satisfaction of judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding against him, provided he shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle an d defend it on his own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.

^^**Requirements of Law**. The granting of Awards and the issuance of shares of Stock shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.

^^**Governing Law**. The Plan and all agreements hereunder shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the state of Delaware.

^^**Compliance with Code**. Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder are intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" under Code Section 422. If any provision of this Plan is susceptible to more than one interpretation, such interpretation shall be given thereto as is consistent with Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan being treated as incentive stock options under the Code. Awards granted hereunder to any person who is a "covered employee" under Code Section 162(m) at any time when the Company is subject to Code Section 162(m) are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Code Section 162(m)(4)(C). If any provision of this Plan is susceptible to more than one interpreta tion, such interpretation shall be given thereto as is consistent with Awards granted under this Plan to such "covered employees" being treated as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m).
