SECTION 5.04  Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither the Purchaser, on the one hand, nor the Seller, on the other hand, may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this Article to be satisfied if such failure was caused by the Purchaser’s, in the first instance, or the Seller’s, in the second instance, failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, including such party’s obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur, as required by  Section 4.02. 

^\centered Termination, Amendment and Waiver 

SECTION 6.01  Termination. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

^^^by the Seller or the Purchaser, if the Closing does not occur on or prior to the date that is four months after the date of this Agreement (the “Outside Date”); or 

^^^^^ 
^^by the Seller or the Purchaser if the Master Purchase Agreement is terminated; 

provided, however, that the party seeking termination pursuant to clauses (ii) through (iv) above is not then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. 

^^In the event of termination by the Seller or the Purchaser pursuant to this Section, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated without further action by any party.

SECTION 6.03  Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. By an instrument in writing, any party may waive compliance by any other party hereto with any term or provision of this Agreement that such other party was or is obligated to comply with or perform.

^^^^^ 
Both indemnification claims arising under Section 7.01(a) of this Agreement and indemnification claims arising under Section 10.01(a)(i) of the Master Purchase Agreement shall reduce the unused portion of the Shared Deductible, such that the reduction in the amount of the Seller’s indemnification obligations under this Agreement and the Parent’s indemnification obligations under the Master Purchase Agreement as a result of the deductibles under such both agreements shall not, on an aggregate basis, exceed $[[USD Value 2: Number]] 

Both indemnification claims arising under Section 7.01(a) of this Agreement (other than claims for indemnification arising out of a breach of Section 2.02 or Section 2.04 of this Agreement) and indemnification claims arising under Section 10.01(a)(i) of the Master Purchase Agreement (other than claims for indemnification arising out a breach of any of the Fundamental Reps (as defined in the Master Purchase Agreement) or the IP Rep (as defined in the Master Purchase Agreement)) shall reduce the unused portion of the Shared Cap, such that the maximum amount of the Seller’s indemnification obligations under Section 7.01(a) of this Agreement (other than claims for indemnification arising out of a breach of Section 2.02 or Section 2.04 of this Agreement) and the Parent’s indemnification obligations under Section 10.01(a)(i) of the Master Purchase Agreement (other than claims for indemnification arising out a breach of any of the Fundamental Reps or the IP Rep) shall not, on an aggregate basis, exceed the Shared Cap.

^^^Both indemnification claims arising under Section 7.02(a) of this Agreement (other than claims for indemnification arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.02 of this Agreement) and indemnification claims arising under Section 10.02(a) of the Master Purchase Agreement (other than claims for indemnification arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.02 of the Master Purchase Agreement) shall reduce the unused portion of the General Purchaser Shared Cap, such that the maximum amount of the Purchaser’s indemnification obligations under Section 7.02(a) of this Agreement (other than claims for indemnification arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.02 of this Agreement) and indemnification claims arising under Section 10.02(a) of the Master Purchase Agreement (other than claims for indemnification arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.02 of the Master Purchase Agreement) shall not, on an aggregate basis, exceed the General Purchaser Shared Cap. 

^^^Both indemnification claims arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.02 of this Agreement and indemnification claims arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties set 

^^^^^ 
forth in Section 5.02 of the Master Purchase Agreement shall reduce the unused portion of the Fundamental Purchaser Shared Cap, such that the maximum amount of the Purchaser’s indemnification obligations under Section 7.02(a) of this Agreement for claims arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.02 of this Agreement and under Section 10.02(a) of the Master Purchase Agreement for claims arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.02 of the Master Purchase Agreement shall not, on an aggregate basis, exceed the Fundamental Purchaser Shared Cap.

^^^^^ 
^Exclusive Monetary Remedy; Suits Against the Seller’s Affiliates and Associates; Nature of Payments; Materiality Qualifications; Payments to the Company. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the parties acknowledge that their sole and exclusive monetary remedy after the Closing with respect to any claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) for damages it may have against any other party arising under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith or therewith, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

^^The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), successors and assigns not to pursue or bring any claim against the Seller’s Affiliates and Associates, in each case, with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to (i) any claims of fraud or (ii) any claims that any distribution or other payment made by the Seller or, with respect to the Seller’s interest in the Final Closing Date Payment, if any, the Parent constituted a fraudulent conveyance, resulted in the insolvency of the Seller or the Parent or was otherwise made in violation of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (including Section 18-607 thereof) or the comparable Laws then applicable to the Seller or the Parent. 

^^Except as required by a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, the Purchaser and the Seller agree to treat any amounts payable pursuant to this Article as adjustments to the purchase price for the Membership Interests for all Tax purposes. 

^^For purposes of calculating the amount of any Loss in connection with a claim by any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty for which indemnification is sought pursuant to this Article (but not for purposes of determining whether such a breach has occurred), all materiality references (including references to Seller Material Adverse Effect, Company Material Adverse Effect and Purchaser Material Adverse Effect) shall be disregarded. 

^^The Purchaser shall be deemed to incur [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of all Losses suffered or incurred by the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries that are indemnifiable under Section 7.01 and, in connection therewith, the Purchaser may, at its option, recover the full amount of such indemnifiable Losses on behalf of Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Purchaser shall have no obligation to pay over, reimburse, indemnify or otherwise transfer to the Company or any such Subsidiary any amount so recovered by the Purchaser. 

SECTION 7.07  Calculation of Losses. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article shall be net of (a) any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party under insurance policies with respect to such Loss, as reduced by any 

^^^^^ 
increase to the insurance premiums payable resulting from such recovery and (b) any net Tax benefit actually realized by the indemnified party as a result of the incurrence of such Loss. 

SECTION 7.08  Procedures. (a)  Third Party Claims. (i) In order for a Person (the “ indemnified party”) to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under  Section 7.01 or  Section 7.02 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any third Person against the indemnified party (a “ Third Party Claim”), such indemnified party must notify the party that will potentially be obligated to provide indemnification hereunder (the “ indemnifying party”) in writing of the Third Party Claim promptly following receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the Third Party Claim, stating in reasonable detail the nature, basis and amount thereof (to the extent then known), along with copies of the relevant notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party evidencing such Third Party Claim, and the basis for indemnification sought;  provided,  however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under this Agreement except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure; it being understood and agreed that the failure of the indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party prior to settling a Third Party Claim (including by paying a claim or executing a settlement agreement with respect thereto) or consenting to the entry of a Judgment or the issuance of an award with respect to a Third Party Claim shall constitute actual prejudice to the indemnifying party. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, promptly following the indemnified party’s receipt thereof, copies of all other notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim. 

^^^If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof by written notice to the indemnified party (which such notice shall state without qualification that such indemnifying party is liable under this Article with respect to such Third Party Claim) within 30 days after the indemnifying party’s receipt of the notice of the Third Party Claim contemplated by paragraph (i) above with counsel selected by the indemnifying party; provided that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party; and provided further that notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and, instead, shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket legal fees, costs and expenses of counsel retained by the indemnified party if (A) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the indemnified party, (C) after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure (not to exceed five Business Days), the indemnifying party failed or is failing to reasonably prosecute or defend such claim, (D) the claim is subject to a cap in Section 7.03 and such claim, together with all other then outstanding and unresolved claims that are subject to such cap, could reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses which are more than the remaining amount indemnifiable by such indemnifying party with respect to such claims pursuant to this Article or (E) in the indemnified party’s reasonable judgment, a conflict of interest between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party exists with respect to the claim. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, (1) the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the 

^^^^^ 
defense thereof and (2) the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. Subject to the limitations and conditions contained in this Article, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof (including in respect of Third Party Claims the defense of which the indemnifying party was not entitled to assume or continue in accordance with the second proviso of the first sentence of this paragraph (ii)). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, all the indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party’s request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, no party shall admit any liability with respect thereto, or settle, compromise or discharge such Third Party Claim without the other applicable party’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, which releases the indemnified party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim and that would not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party. The parties hereto will act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling and otherwise dealing with all Third Party Claims. 

^^^Subject to Section 7.09, the indemnification required by Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense of the Third Party Claim, as and when bills are received or Losses are incurred. 

^^^All claims under Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 other than Third Party Claims shall be governed by paragraph (b) below. 

^^Direct Claims. If any indemnified party should have a claim against any indemnifying party under Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such indemnified party (any such claim, a “Direct Claim”), the indemnified party shall deliver notice of such Direct Claim promptly following its discovery of such matter, with such notice stating in reasonable detail the nature, basis and amount thereof (to the extent then known), along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing such matter, if any, and the basis for indemnification sought; provided that the failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under this Agreement except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been adversely prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party within 30 calendar days following its receipt of such notice that the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party under Section 7.01 or Section 7.02, as the case may be, such Direct Claim 

^^^^^ 
specified in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under Section 7.01 or Section 7.02, as the case may be, and the indemnifying party shall, subject to Section 7.09, pay the amount of such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the Direct Claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such Direct Claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined (provided that the indemnifying party shall have 30 calendar days following its receipt of such final determination to dispute the amount of such final determination). If the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such Direct Claim as provided above, the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction. 

SECTION 7.09  Setoff Against the Final Closing Date Payment under the Master Purchase Agreement. 

^^Finally Determined Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article and in accordance with Section 10.10 of the Master Purchase Agreement, the parties agree that the Seller’s obligation to make indemnification payments under Section 7.01(a) shall, in lieu of being satisfied through payments in cash in accordance with Section 7.08(a)(iii) and Section 7.08(b), be instead satisfied through a dollar-for-dollar setoff by the Purchaser against the Final Closing Date Payment (as defined in the Master Purchase Agreement); provided, however, that, at the option of the Purchaser, such indemnification obligations shall not be satisfied through such a dollar-for-dollar setoff and, instead, the Seller shall be required to make such payments in cash in accordance with Section 7.08(a)(iii) and Section 7.08(b): 

^^^with regard to any indemnification claim arising under Section 7.01(a), if the Final Closing shall have already occurred by the time that the Purchaser delivers notice of such indemnification claim to the Seller under Section 7.08(a)(i) or the first sentence of Section 7.08(b); or 

^^^with regard to any indemnification obligation arising in connection with a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.02 or Section 2.04. 

^^Undetermined or Disputed Claims. With regard to any claim for indemnification under Section 7.01(a) that the Purchaser shall have provided notice to the Seller under Section 7.08(a)(i) or the first sentence of Section 7.08(b), but for which the Seller’s payment obligation under Section 7.08(a)(iii) or Section 7.08(b) shall not yet, as of the Final Closing Date, have become due (any such amount, a “Disputed Amount”), then in lieu of a dollar-for-dollar setoff against the Final Closing Date Payment as provided for in the preceding paragraph (a), the Purchaser shall instead include any Disputed Amounts in the Final Closing Date Payment, and Purchaser shall instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to hold such Disputed Amounts in escrow until the first to occur of (i) resolution of the applicable dispute, including through the payment of any amount required under this Article (in which case the Purchaser and the Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to release the applicable Disputed Amount accordingly) and (ii) the entry of a final and nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the release of any Disputed Amount by the Escrow Agent. 

^^^^^

SECTION 8.05  Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Schedule hereto but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this Agreement. Whenever the words “include”, “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”. The words “hereof”, “hereto”, “hereby”, “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The terms “or”, “any” and “either” are not exclusive. The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if”. The word “will” shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word “shall”. The words “assets” and “properties” shall be deemed to have the same meaning, and to refer to all assets and properties, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible. Any references to the masculine, feminine or neuter gender shall include such other genders, unless the context otherwise requires. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms.

^^^^^ 
Person’s death or incapacity, such Person’s executors, administrators, guardians and other legal representatives.

SECTION 8.07  Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements (in each case, in the form in existence on the date hereof) and the Confidentiality Agreement, along with the schedules and exhibits hereto and thereto, contain the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter. None of the parties hereto shall be liable or bound to any other Person in any manner by any representations, warranties or covenants relating to such subject matter except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, in the Ancillary Agreements to which such party is a party, and in the Confidentiality Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, but not any Ancillary Agreement that is an Exhibit), on one hand, and the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (including the schedules and exhibits thereto, but not including the Master Purchase Agreement), on the other hand, the provisions of this Agreement shall control. 

SECTION 8.08  Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under this Section with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

SECTION 8.09  Governing Law. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or related in any way to this Agreement, the relationship of the parties, the transactions leading to this Agreement or contemplated hereby or the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereunder or related in any way to the foregoing, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal, substantive laws of the State of [[Address 5: Address]] agreements entered into and to be performed solely within such State without regard to the conflict of laws principles of such State.
