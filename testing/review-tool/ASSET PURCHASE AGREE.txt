If the restrictions against engaging in competition contained in this Section 5.2 are determined in accordance with Section 9.1 to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too great a period of time or over too great a geographical area or by reason of its being too extensive in any other respect, this Section 5.2 shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time for which it may be enforceable and over the maximum geographical areas as to which it may be enforceable and to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may be enforceable all as determined in accordance with Section 9.1. Each Party hereby waives any right to assert that any provision of law renders the restrictions contained in this Section 5.2 as invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect. 

^^Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Section 5.2 will cause irreparable damage and great loss to the other Party or its Affiliates, the exact amount of which will be difficult to ascertain, and that the remedies at law for any such breach will be inadequate. Accordingly, each Party acknowledges and agrees that in the event of such a breach, the other Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, without posting bond or other security and without a showing of the inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy.

^Indemnification by Seller. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates, and the directors, officers, managers, employees and Representatives of Buyer and its Affiliates, from and against any and all liabilities, judgments, claims, settlements, losses, damages, fees, Liens, Taxes, penalties, obligations and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses and costs and expenses of investigation) (collectively, “***Losses***”) incurred or suffered, directly or indirectly, by any such Person arising from, by reason of or in connection with: 

^^any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement or any Related Document;

^^except with respect to the laws of Barbados, the failure of Seller to comply with any Applicable Laws relating to bulk sales or Tax applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

^^any Transfer Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to Section 5.4; 

^^any Permitted Lien relating to the Acquired Assets; and 

^^any fees payable by Seller to any entity set forth on Schedule 3.16 hereto. 

^Indemnification by Buyer.

^^The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article VIII shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such Losses (net of any Tax or expenses incurred in connection with such recovery). For purposes of clarification, nothing set forth in this provision shall require the Buyer to seek recovery under its insurance policies with respect to such Losses. 

^^Any indemnity payment hereunder shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. Where the receipt of any such payment is treated for Tax purposes in a manner other than as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, the amount of the payment shall be adjusted to take account of any net Tax cost actually incurred, or benefit actually enjoyed, by the Indemnified Party in respect thereof. 

^^Each Party shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

^Certain Procedures for Indemnification. 

^^If any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an “***Indemnified Party***”) asserts a claim for indemnification, or receives notice of the assertion of any claim or of the commencement of any Action by any Person not a party to this Agreement against such Indemnified Party, for which a Party is required to provide indemnification under this Article VIII (an “***Indemnifying Party***”), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that Action; *provided, however*, that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such Action. 

^^With respect to third party claims for which indemnification is claimed hereunder (each, an “***Indemnification Claim***”), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such Indemnification Claim, and (ii) if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, such Indemnification Claim can properly be resolved by money damages alone and the Indemnifying Party has the financial resources to pay such damages and commits to diligently and vigorously conduct such defense, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled (A) to direct the defense of any Indemnification Claim at its sole cost and expense, but such defense shall be conducted by legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and (B) to settle and compromise any such Indemnification Claim or Action for money damages alone; *provided, however*, that if the Indemnified Party has elected to be represented by separate counsel pursuant to the proviso below, or if such settlement or compromise does not include an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party for any liability arising out of such Indemnification Claim or Action, such settlement or compromise shall be effected only with the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement or compromise offer solely for money damages is made by the applicable third party claimant, and the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing of the Indemnifying Party’s willingness to accept the offer and, subject to the applicable limitations of Sections 8.6, pay the amount called for by such offer, and the Indemnified Party declines to accept such offer, the Indemnified Party may continue to contest such Indemnification Claim, free of any participation by the Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such Indemnification Claim that the Indemnifying Party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement or compromise offer that the Indemnified Party declined to accept plus the Losses of the Indemnified Party relating to such Indemnification Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the aggregate Losses of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Indemnification Claim. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or Action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Section 8.5 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; *provided, however*, that if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, an actual or potential conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that would make such separate representation advisable, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel to represent it and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party; *provided further*, that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the fees of more than one law firm for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall each render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such Action. 

^^In the event that Seller owes any amounts to Buyer with respect to Seller’s indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VIII, then without limiting any other rights or remedies of Buyer hereunder, and subject to the Cap, the Buyer shall be entitled to offset any unpaid and indemnifiable Losses against any Milestone Payments remaining due to the Seller hereunder. 

^Certain Limitations on Indemnification. 

^^Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VIII, no Party shall have any indemnification obligations for Losses under Sections 8.2(a) or 8.3(a) unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $[***] (the “***Basket***”), in which case Seller or Buyer, as applicable, shall be liable for all Losses arising from such Indemnification Claim (subject to the Cap, as defined below). In no event shall the aggregate indemnification to be paid by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, for any indemnification obligations for Losses under Sections 8.2(a) or 8.3(a) exceed $[***] (the “***Cap***”). 

^^If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any Indemnification Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Indemnification Claim. For purposes of clarification, nothing set forth in this provision shall require the Indemnifying Party to seek recovery under its insurance policies with respect to such Indemnification Claim.

^Exclusive Remedy. The sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or failure to be true and correct, of any representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the Related Documents, shall be indemnification in accordance with this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Parties hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have against the other Party, arising under or based upon any Applicable Law (including any such law relating to environmental matters or arising under or based upon common law or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.7 shall not operate to limit the rights of the Parties to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief) or limit the rights of the Parties to pursue claims based upon fraud. 

\centered **MISCELLANEOUS** 

^Governing Law. Construction and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive Applicable Law of another jurisdiction.

Neither the failure of either Party to enforce, nor the delay of either Party in enforcing, any condition or part of this Agreement at any time shall be construed as a waiver of that condition or part or forfeit any rights to future enforcement thereof.

^Arbitration. 

^^Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any disputes, claims or controversies arising between the Parties relating to, arising out of or in any way connected with this Agreement or any term or condition hereof, or the performance by either Party of its obligations hereunder, shall be promptly presented to the Chief Executive Officers of Buyer and Seller (or alternative officers designated by Buyer or Seller) for resolution and if such officers cannot promptly resolve such disputes, claims or controversies then such dispute, claim or controversey shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration. Whenever a Party shall decide to institute arbitration proceedings, it shall give written notice to that effect to the other Party. The Party giving such notice shall refrain from instituting the arbitration proceedings for a period of sixty (60) days following such notice. 

^^Any arbitration hereunder shall be conducted before the American Arbitration Association, or its successor. The arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator and shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the American Arbitration Association unless specifically modified herein. The arbitration shall be located in New York, New York. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant specific performance, and to allocate between the Parties the costs of arbitration in such equitable manner as he or she determines. 

^^The parties covenant and agree that the arbitration shall commence within ninety (90) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either Party (the “***Filing Date***”). In connection with the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall have the power to order the production of documents by each Party and any third-party witnesses. In addition, each Party may take up to three (3) depositions as of right, and the arbitrator may in his or her discretion allow additional depositions upon good cause shown by the moving party. However, the arbitrator shall not have the power to order the answering of interrogatories or the response to requests for admission. In connection with any arbitration, each Party shall provide to the other, no later than seven (7) Business Days before the date of the arbitration, the identity of all persons that may testify at the arbitration and a copy of all documents that may be introduced at the arbitration or considered or used by a Party’s witnesses or experts.

The arbitrator’s decision shall set forth a reasoned basis for any award of damages or finding of liability. 

^^The Parties covenant and agree that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith. Any Party unsuccessfully refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrator shall be 

\centered ***[***]: CONFIDENTIAL PORTIONS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION.*** liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the other Party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, this Section 9.7 shall not apply to any request by any Party to this Agreement for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief or other forms of equitable relief. 

^^Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. 

^Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by either Party hereto without the prior written consent of the other Party hereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld; *provided, however*, that, upon prior written notice to the other Party, either Party may assign, sublicense, subcontract or delegate this Agreement and any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (i) to any of its Affiliates, (ii) in connection with a merger, consolidation, sale of substantially all of such Party’s assets or (iii) otherwise by operation of Applicable Law without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any attempted assignment, sublicense, subcontract or delegation in violation of this Section 9.8 shall be null and void. 

^Enforceability; Severability. Without limitation to Section 5.2(e), (a) if any covenant or provision hereof is determined to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, it shall not be deemed to affect or impair the validity of any other covenant or provision hereof if the rights and obligations of a Party hereto will not be materially and adversely affected, each of which is hereby declared to be separate and distinct, (b) if any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, and (c) if any provision of this Agreement is declared invalid or unenforceable for any reason other than overbreadth, the Parties hereto agree to modify the offending provision so as to maintain the essential benefits of the bargain (including the rights and obligations hereunder) between the Parties to the maximum extent possible, consistent with Applicable Law and public policy. 

^Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Schedules and Exhibits expressly contemplated hereby and attached hereto, the Related Documents and the other agreements, certificates and documents delivered in connection herewith or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, contain the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements or understandings among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed original counterpart of this Agreement.
