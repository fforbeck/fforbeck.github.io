The Closing Payment payable by Buyer at Closing shall be adjusted pursuant to the Closing Settlement Statement which shall be based on a good faith estimate by Seller when complete, actual information is not available.

^^No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, in accordance with this Agreement, a statement (the “**Final Settlement Statement**”) setting forth each adjustment to the Base Purchase Price under **Sections 3.3(a)** and (b) of this Agreement as finally determined as of the Closing and showing the calculation of such adjustments. As soon as practicable after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, but no later than thirty (30) days after such receipt, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report containing all changes that Buyer proposes to the Final Settlement Statement. The Parties shall undertake to agree with respect to the amounts due pursuant to such post-Closing adjustments not later than fifteen (15) days after delivery of Buyer’s requested changes. If Buyer fails to propose any changes to the Final Settlement Statement within the time set forth above, it shall be deemed that Buyer agrees with the Final Settlement Statement, which shall become final and binding on the Parties.

^^If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree upon any adjustment to the Base Purchase Price under Section 3.3(d) no later than fifteen (15) days after delivery of Buyer’s requested changes, if any, then Weaver, LLP, Ft.

Such decision shall be final and binding upon the Parties. If such firm is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, Seller and Buyer shall attempt, in good faith, to designate another acceptable Person or firm as the sole arbiter of such matters.

^^It is the intent of the Parties that any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall be made only once and without duplication.

^^**Allocated Values**  
. **Schedule 3.4 (a)** sets forth an allocation of that portion of the Base Purchase Price allocated to the Subject Interests. (Such allocated value for any individual Subject Interest, an “**Allocated Value**” and for all Subject Interests collectively, the “**Allocated Values**”).

\centered **DEFECTS AND ADJUSTMENTS**

^^**Defects**  
.  
^^Buyer may conduct, at its sole cost, such title examination or investigation, and other examinations and investigations, as it may in its discretion determine with respect to Subject Interests in order to determine whether any Defects exist. Buyer must deliver to Seller in writing by 5:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time on the Defect Notice Date a written notice specifying each alleged Defect associated with a Subject Interest, a description of each such Defect, the amount of the adjustment that it asserts based on such Defect (which can in no case be greater than the Allocated Value of the related Subject Interest) and its method of calculating such adjustment. Except for the Defects set forth in such notice tim ely received, Buyer will be deemed to have absolutely waived its right to any adjustment, and every other Claim, with respect to any potential or actual Defect affecting, or allegedly affecting, any Subject Interest. Seller may, at its election at or prior to Closing, elect to remove from the sale to Buyer and retain a Subject Interests to the extent affected by an asserted Defect if Seller is receiving payment of production proceeds from such Subject Interest despite such asserted Defect and reduce the Base Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of the retained Subject Interest.

^^Upon timely delivery of a notice under Section 4.1(a), Buyer and Seller will in good faith negotiate the validity of the Defects and the amount of the adjustment, if any, using the following criteria:

^^^No single Defect shall be taken into account as an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price unless the value of such Defect is determined to be more than Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 3: Number]]) (the “**Individual Defect Threshold**”).

^^^No adjustment will be made under this Section 4.1 unless the net total Defect Value of all Defects that exceed the Individual Defect Threshold exceeds the Aggregate Defect Threshold. By way of example, if the net total Defect Value of all Defects that exceed the Individual Defect Threshold equals $[[USD Value 4: Number]] then an adjustment of $[[USD Value 5: Number]] may, subject to the further provisions of this Section 4.1, be made.

^^^If a requested adjustment is based on Seller owning a net revenue interest for a Subject Interest less than that shown in **Schedule 3.4**, then a downward adjustment shall be calculated by multiplying the Allocated Value set forth on **Schedule 3.4** for such Subject Interest by a fraction (A) the numerator of which is an amount equal to the net revenue interest shown on **Schedule 3.4** for such Subject Interest less the net revenue interest to which the Seller would be entitled as a result of its ownership in such Subject Interest after conside ration of such Title Defect and (B) the denominator of which is the net revenue interest shown for such Subject Interest on **Schedule 3.4**.

^^^If the adjustment is based on an increase or decrease in the Company’s expense interest for a Subject Interest from that shown on **Schedule 3.4**, but without a proportionate adjustment in the Company’s net revenue interest, then the adjustment shall be calculated by rerunning the economics used in determining the Allocated Value for the Subject Interest as set forth on **Schedule 3.4** using a discount rate of [[Percentage 3]]%.

^^^To the extent that any downward adjustments are requested by Buyer, Seller may offset the downward adjustments by upward adjustments (“Upward Adjustment”) in any of the Subject Interests, calculated on the same basis as **Section 4(b)(iii), and (iv)**, provided the Seller asserts such upward adjustments by the Defect Notice Date.

^^^If a requested adjustment is based on a Lien or other monetary charge upon a Subject Interest that is liquidated in amount, then the adjustment is the amount necessary to remove such Lien or other monetary charge from the affected Subject Interest.

^^^If a requested adjustment is based on an obligation, burden or liability upon the affected Subject Interest for which Buyer’s economic detriment is not liquidated but can be estimated with reasonable certainty, then the adjustment is the amount necessary to compensate Buyer at Closing for the adverse economic effect on the affected Subject Interest.

^^^The existence of any imbalances with respect to natural gas shall not be deemed a Title Defect.

^^^It is the intent of the Parties that any adjustment made pursuant to this Agreement with respect to a Defect shall be made only once and without duplication.

^^If the Aggregate Defect Threshold is exceeded and therefore adjustments are to be made to the Base Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 4.1, Seller may, at its sole option, elect to cure some or all of the Defects submitted by Buyer.

^^At Closing the Seller shall transfer to the Escrow Agent immediately available funds equal to the amount (the “**Contested Amount**”), if any, by which (i) the aggregate Defect Value of all uncured or unresolved Defects listed by Buyer in the notice given to Seller on or prior to the Defect Notice Date less the Defect Value of Subject Interests that Seller elects to retain and exclude from the sale pursuant to Section 4.1(a) exceeds (ii) the Aggregate Defect Threshold. The Escrow Funds, with such interest as is earned thereon, shall be retained by the Escrow Agent to hold and disburs e pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.1; provided that if the Contested Amount is less than $[[USD Value 6: Number]] then the Contested Amount shall be paid to and held by Seller pending the resolution of the uncured or unresolved Defects as provided in **Sections 4.1(e)** and **4.1(f)** and Seller shall retain or return part or all of the Contested Amount as directed by arbiter pursuant to Section 4.1(f). The Escrow Agreement shall provide that Seller shall have the right to direct the investment of the Escrow Funds. From time to time after the Closing Date the Parties shall cause the release of Escrow Funds as set forth in Section 4.1(e) below. Following the dat e that is sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, the only Escrow Funds that are to remain in the Escrow Account are funds related to Defects, if any, that are disputed by Seller or Buyer, such disputed Defects to be resolved pursuant to Section 4.1(f) below. Buyer recognizes and agrees that its only recourse with respect to Defects is against the Escrow Funds, or the Contested Amount if held by Seller, pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.1.

^^Buyer will reasonably cooperate (without being required to incur any costs or expenses) with Seller after the Closing to cure Defects that Seller has elected to cure. If Seller is able to cure any Defect and Buyer agrees that such Defect has been cured, then the Parties will cause the Escrow Agent to pay Seller the applicable Defect Value. With respect to any interest that is determined to be defective but which for which Buyer is receiving payment of production proceeds despite such Defect, Seller may require Buyer to reconvey the defective Subject Interest to Seller, and Buyer will be paid the Allocated Value for such defective Subject Interest in the manner and as adjusted pursuant to Section 4.1(f)(i). In the event that cured Defects cause the total Defect Value to fall beneath the Aggregate Defect Threshold, then the Parties shall cause all Escrow Funds to be paid to Seller. If, by the date that is sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, Seller is unable to cure an asserted Defect that Seller elected to cure, and Seller agrees that it is a valid Defect and with the Defect Value asserted by Buyer, then the Parties will cause the Escrow Agent to pay Buyer the applicable Defect Value to the extent Escrow Funds are available.

^^If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree upon any Defect, Defect Value or Upward Adjustment under this Section 4.1, the following shall occur:

^^^Seller, at its option, may elect to have Buyer reconvey the Subject Interest to the extent affected by the alleged Defect if Buyer is receiving payment of production proceeds from such affected Subject Interest and to refund to Buyer the Allocated Value of such affected Subject Interest to be paid initially from the Escrow Funds in the amount of any Defect Value of such affected Subject Interest with any balance remaining in the Allocated Value for such affected Subject Interest payable directly from Seller. In this case, the Subject Interest shall be re-conveyed from Buyer to Seller in the same form of conveyance as Seller assigned the same to Buyer; the amount refunded to Buyer shall be adjusted to reflect the rever sal of any adjustments theretofore made under **Sections 3.3(a)** through **3.3(d)** as well as any payments made to and expenses paid by Buyer with respect to such affected Subject Interest subsequent to the Closing; or

^^^Seller and Buyer shall attempt, in good faith, to designate an attorney experienced in oil and gas law licensed to practice law in the State of Mississippi as the arbiter of the alleged Defects, Defect Values or Upward Adjustments with respect to such Subject Interests that Seller does not elect to have reconveyed, whose decision on all such matters must be rendered within thirty (30) days of the date of his or her joint designation, and will be final and binding on all Parties. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the designation of an attorney as the arbiter prior to the date that is sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, then Seller or Buyer, or either of them, may in writing request the American Arbi tration Association to appoint such an arbiter, whose decision must be rendered within thirty (30) days of the date on which the arbiter is appointed by the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of any applicable state statutes or laws or this Agreement. The costs and expenses of the arbiter shall be shared one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer. Within five (5) days after the decision of the arbiter, Seller and Buyer shall issue written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release funds in accordance with the arbiter’s decision.

^^**Title Defect Values**  
. In determining the value of a Title Defect, it is the intent of the Parties to include, to the extent possible, only that portion of the Subject Interests, whether an undivided interest, separate interest or otherwise, materially and adversely affected by the Title Defect. The Title Defect value shall in no event exceed the Allocated Value of the affected Subject Interest. Subject to such limitation, the Title Defect value shall be determined by the Parties in good faith taking into account all relevant factors.

^^**TITLE WARRANTY**  
. SELLER SHALL CONVEY SELLER’S INTERESTS IN AND TO THE PROPERTIES TO BUYER SUBJECT TO ALL ROYALTIES, OVERRIDING ROYALTIES, BURDENS, AND ENCUMBRANCES, WITH A SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE AS TO THE NET REVENUE INTERESTS AND THE EXPENSE INTERESTS SET FORTH ON **SCHEDULE 3.4**, AS PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF ASSIGNMENT, BILL OF SALE AND CONVEYANCE ATTACHED AS **EXHIBIT B**HERETO.

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from and after Closing, Seller's and Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy against each other with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements of the Parties contained in Article 5, Article 6, Article 7 (excluding **Sections 7.1** and 7.3, which shall be separately enforceable by Seller pursuant to whatever rights and remedies are available to it outside this Article 13), and Article 8 is set forth in this Section 13.2.

^^**Indemnification Actions**  
. All claims for indemnification under Section 13.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

^^For purposes of this Article 13, the term "Indemnifying Person" when used in connection with a particular Claim shall mean the Person having an obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Claim pursuant to this Article 13, and the term "Indemnified Person" when used in connection with a particular Claim shall mean a Person having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Claim pursuant to this Article 13 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those Persons identified in Section 13.3(h)).

^^To make a claim for indemnification under Section 13.2, an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim, including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "**Claim Notice**"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the Indemnified Person (a "**Third Party Claim**"), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall en close a complete copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 13.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under Section 13.2, except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Person's ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached and the reasonably specific details of, and specific basis for, suc h asserted inaccuracy or breach.

^^In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Party Claim under this Article 13. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period regarding whether the Indemnifying Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be deemed to have denied its obligation to provide such indemnification hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

^^If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Clai m controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 13.3(d). An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that (i) does not result in a final, non-appealable, resolution of the Indemnified Person's liability with respect to the Third Party Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person from all further liability in respect of such Third Party Claim) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

^^If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Third Party Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified Person's choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume the defense of the Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final, non-appealable determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation for indemnification with respect to such Third Party Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, including the power to reject the proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Third Party Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation for indemnification in writing and assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity therefor.

^^If a Party would be required to defend a Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 13.3, which Third Party Claim is liquidated in amount, but for the assertion that the other Party would not be entitled to indemnification for any liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award, judgment, or other damages incurred or suffered by such Party due solely to the limitations set forth in Section 13.5(c) with respect to the amount of such Claim, such Party shall nevertheless have the right and obligation to defend against such Third Party Claim as set forth in Section 13.3(d), subject to the indemnification o bligations of such Party set forth in this Article 13; provided, however, that if, upon final, non-appealable liquidation of the amount of such Third Party Claim, the Party defending such Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 13.3(f) would not have had the obligation to defend such Claim under Section 13.5(c) due solely to the limitations set forth in Section 13.5(c) with respect to the amount of such Third Party Claim, the Party defending such Third Party Claim shall be entitled to reimbursement of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim.

^^In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Claims complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such Claims or (iii) dispute the assertion for such Claims. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the Claims or that it disputes the assertion for such Claims, the Indemnifying Person shall be conclusively deemed to have disputed the claim for indemnification hereunder.

^^Any claim for indemnity under Section 13.2 by any Affiliate, director, officer, employee or agent must be brought and administered by the applicable Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person other than the Seller and Buyer shall have any rights against either Seller or Buyer under the terms of Section 13.2 except as may be exercised on its behalf by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 13.3(h). Each of Seller and Buyer may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this Section 13.3 on behalf of the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Person for any action or inaction under this Section 13.3.

^^**Casualty and Condemnation**.  
^^Subject to **Section 12(e)**, if, after the date of this Agreement but prior to Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (a "**Casualty Loss**"), this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close.

^^In the event of a Casualty Loss, (i) if the Parties shall agree, Seller shall cause the Assets affected by any Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored, at Seller's sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), and indemnify Buyer through a document reasonably acceptable to Seller and Buyer against any damages or other costs or expenses that Buyer incurs with respect to the Properties subject to the Casualty Loss (and in each case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance and other claims against third Persons with respect to the Casualty Loss or taking except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing), or, (ii) if the Parties do not agree to act pursuant to clause (i), then the affected Assets shall be excluded from the Properties, and the Base Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value thereof.

.  
^^Except with respect to Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6, the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article 5 and the covenants and agreements of Seller in Article 8 shall survive the Closing until [[Date 7: Date]]. Except with respect to Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5, the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in Article 6 shall survive until [[Date 7]].

Representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fid e claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement prior to its expiration date.

The indemnities in Sections 13.2(a)(i) and 13.2(b)(i) shall continue without time limit.

^^No Party shall have any liability for any indemnification under Sections 13.2(a)(ii), 13.2(a)(iii), 13.2(b)(ii) or 13.2(b)(iii) for an individual matter until and unless the amount of the liability for Damages with respect to which such Party admits, or it is otherwise finally determined, that such Party has an obligation to indemnify the other Party pursuant to the terms of one of such subsections exceeds Four Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 10: Number]]) (the "Individual Indemnity Threshold"). Without limiting the foregoing, no Party shall have any liability for any indemnification under Sections 13.2(a)(ii), 13.2(a)(iii), 13.2(b)(ii) or 13.2(b)(iii) until the aggregate amount of the liability for all Damages which satis fies all of the following clauses exceeds $[[USD Value 5]]:

^^^Claim Notices for such Damages have been delivered by the other Party in accordance with this Agreement;

^^^such Party admits (or it is otherwise finally determined) that such Party has an obligation to indemnify the other Party pursuant hereto for such Damages, and

^^^each individual matter related to a Damage claim exceeds the Individual Indemnity Threshold**;**

provided, however, that in no event shall this subsection (c) limit indemnification of Buyer for the Retained Liabilities or indemnification of Seller for the Assumed Liabilities**;** and provided, further, that, for the purposes of this Article 13, any representation, warranty, or covenant set forth in this Agreement which is qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed not to be so qualified.

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to indemnify the other Party under this Article 13 for aggregate Damages in excess of ten percent ([[Percentage 3]]%) of the Base Purchase Price; provided, however, that this Section 13.5(d) shall not apply to or limit indemnification for the Retained Liabilities, the Assumed Liabilities, or Seller's obligations under the special warranty of title in the Assignment and Bill of Sale.

^^The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under this Article 13 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to such Damages (net of any collection costs); provided, however, that no Party shall be required to seek recovery under any policy of insurance as a condition to indemnification hereunder.

^^As used in this Agreement, the term "Damages" means the amount of any actual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award, or judgment incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Person arising out of or resulting from the indemnified matter, whether attributable to personal injury or death, property damage, contract claims, torts, or otherwise, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants, or other agents and experts reasonably incident to matters indemnified against, and the costs of investigation and/or monitoring of such matters, and the costs of enforcement of the indemnity; provided, however, that "Damages" shall not include any adjustment for Taxes that may be assessed on payments under this Ar ticle 13 or for Tax benefits received by the Indemnified Person as a consequence of any Damages.
