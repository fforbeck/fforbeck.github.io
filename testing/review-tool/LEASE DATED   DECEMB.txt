^^^Landlord shall within fifteen (15) days following the date on which Landlord receives an Option Exercise Notice select a surveyor and notify Tenant in writing of the name, address and qualifications of such surveyor. Within fifteen (15) days following Tenant’s receipt of Landlord’s notice of the surveyor selected by Landlord, Tenant shall select a surveyor and notify Landlord of the name, address and qualifications of such surveyor. Such two surveyors shall endeavour to agree upon Fair Market Value based on a written appraisal made by each of them as of the date of the Option Exercise Notice. If such two surveyors shall agree upon a Fair Market Value, the amount of such Fair Market Value as so agreed shall be binding and conclusive upon Landlord and Tenant.

^^^If such two surveyors shall be unable to agree upon a Fair Market Value within twenty (20) days after the selection of a surveyor by Tenant then such surveyors shall advise Landlord and Tenant of then respective determination of Fair Market Value, the two appraisers shall select a third surveyor to make the determination of Fair Market Value. The selection of the third surveyor shall be binding and conclusive upon Landlord and Tenant.

^^^If such two surveyors shall be unable to agree upon the designation of a third surveyor within ten (10) days after the expiration of the twenty (20) day period referred to in clause (ii) above, or if such third surveyor does not make a determination of Fair Market Value within twenty (20) days after his selection, then such third surveyor or a substituted third surveyor, as applicable, shall, at the request of either party hereto, be appointed by the Chairman of the Scottish RIGS. If the said Chairman shall, for any reason, not be available or shall be unable to make such appointment at the time of the application therefor, then the appointment may be made by the next senior officer of the Scottish RICS then available and able to make such appointment or, if no such officer of the Scottish RICS shall be so available and able, by such officer of such professional body of surveyors as the Landlord shall designate (and any reference to the Chairman shall be deemed to include a reference to such senior office holder or other officer). The determination of Fair Market Value made by the third surveyor appointed pursuant hereto shall be made within twenty (20) days after such appointment.

^^^If a third surveyor is selected, Fair Market Value shall be the average of the determination of Fair Market Value made by the third surveyor and the determination of Fair Market Value made by the surveyor (selected pursuant to clause 10.1(i) hereof) whose determination of Fair Market Value is nearest to that of the third surveyor. Such average shall be binding and conclusive upon Landlord and Tenant.

^^^All appraisers selected or appointed pursuant to this clause 10.1 shall (A) be independent qualified Scottish RICS surveyors (B) have no right, power or authority to alter or modify the provisions of this Lease, (C) utilize the definition of Fair Market Value set forth in clause 10.3, and (D) be registered in the Scottish RICS. For all purposes, the third surveyor shall be deemed an arbiter.

^^^The Cost of the procedure described in this clause 10.1 above shall be borne equally by Landlord and Tenant.

^^If, by virtue of any delay, Fair Market Value is not determined by the Option Purchase Date, then the Option Purchase Date shall be extended to a date no later than ten (10) days following a determination of Fair Market Value.

^**PROCEDURES UPON PURCHASE**

11.1.1   Unless otherwise agreed in writing, if the Premises are purchased by the Tenant pursuant to clause (A) of Part 6 of the Schedule, the Landlord need not convey any better title thereto than that which was conveyed to the Landlord provided always that the Premises shall be sold free and clear of all encumbrances effected or granted by the Landlord (other than servitudes, wayleaves and others agreed to by the Tenant in accordance with the requirements of Scottish law).

11.1.2   Upon the date fused for any such purchase pursuant to any provision of this Lease, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord, or to any Person to whom the Landlord directs payment, the Offer Amount specified herein, in immediately available cleared funds, and the Landlord shall deliver to the Tenant such instruments as shall be necessary to transfer to the Tenant or its nominee any other property then required to be sold by the Landlord to the Tenant pursuant to this Lease together with an amount equal to all Net Awards and proceeds received and retained by the Landlord arising out of any insurance claims dining the Term which the Landlord has not paid over to the Tenant or has not used to reinstate the Premises or has not been applied in reducing the Rent payable by the Tenant.

^**ALIENATION**

^^Except as otherwise expressly provided to the contrary in this clause 12, Tenant may not (i) assign this Lease either in whole or in part, voluntarily or involuntarily, whether by operation of law or otherwise (including through merger or consolidation) to any Person, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent may be granted or withheld by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion or (ii) enter into subleases. Tenant shall have the right, with no consent of Landlord being required or necessary (a Preapproved Assignation) to assign the whole of the Tenant’s interest in this Lease by operation of law or otherwise to any Preapproved Assignee. Any purported sublease or assignation in breach of this clause 12 shall be null and void. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this clause 12, Tenant shall not have the right to assign this Lease (voluntarily or involuntarily, whether by operation of law or otherwise), or sublet the Premises to any Person at any time that a Breach Event exists.

^^Notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary upon each assignation of all or any of the Tenant’s rights and/or interests under the Lease:

12.2.1   the assignee under such assignation shall expressly assume all the obligations of Tenant hereunder, actual or contingent, including obligations of Tenant which may have arisen on or prior to the date of such assignation, by a written instrument delivered to Landlord at the time of such assignation;

12.2.2   if such assignation is a permitted assignation of the whole of the Tenant interest in this Lease to either (i) a Credit Entity, (ii) an Asset Credit Entity or (iii) a Person whose obligations are guaranteed by a Credit Entity or an Asset Credit Entity pursuant to a Guarantee in the form annexed hereto as Part 10 of the Schedule (but in no other circumstances), then the assignor thereunder and its predecessors in title and any guarantor of this Lease shall, on the date of the entry thereunder be discharged from all liability under this Lease and any guarantee of this Lease, as applicable, but that entirely without prejudice to the Landlord’s right and any assignees obligations hereunder, including those assumed by virtue of the instrument specified at 12.2.1 hereof;

12.2.3   if such assignation is a permitted assignation of the whole of the Tenant interest in this Lease to any Person that is and continues for the balance of the Term to be a member of Tenant’s Group (but in no other circumstances) then the Guarantor shall not be discharged from any liability under the Guarantee, and if required by the Landlord, the Guarantor shall again execute the Guarantee concurrently with such assignation;

12.2.4   if such assignation is an assignation other than that set out in 12.2.2 hereof the assignor thereunder shall remain jointly and severally liability for the performance and implementation of the obligation and conditions contained in the Lease and on the part of the Tenant and the assignation shall not affect or reduce any of the obligations of the assignor nor the Tenant (for the time being) hereunder or of the Guarantor and without prejudice to the provisions of clause 12.2.2 any discharge by the Landlord of the Tenant and for the assignor or their predecessors in title shall only be validly given if executed by the Landlord in self proving manner.

^^Tenant shall have the right, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Landlord, to enter into one or more subleases with any third parties that let, in the aggregate, up to, but not to exceed twenty-five percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the gross lettable area of the Buildings at the Premises, with no consent or approval of Landlord being required or necessary (each, a Preapproved Sublease). Other than pursuant to Preapproved Sublease, at no time during the Term shall subleases exist for more than twenty-five percent ([[Percentage 2]]%) of the gross lettable area of the Buildings at the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any Preapproved Sublease and any other sublease consented to by Landlord in accordance with this clause 12.3 shall provide that, as a condition thereto and shall not be effective unless, the applicable subtenant enter into a direct contract with the Landlord to enable the Landlord to achieve the intents of the provisions set forth in clause 12.7.

^^Each sublease of the Premises shall (A) not extend beyond the then current Term minus one day; (B) terminate upon any termination of this Lease, unless Landlord elects in writing, to cause the subtenant to recognize Landlord as the Landlord under such sublease, whereupon such sub tenant shall continue as a direct lease between sub tenant and Landlord upon all the terms and conditions of such sublease; and (C) bind the sub-tenant to all undertakings contained in clause 8.14 with respect to sublet premises to the same extent as if the sub-tenants were Tenant.

^^Notwithstanding any provision in this clause 12 or elsewhere in this Lease to the contrary, including any right or option Tenant may have to assign this Lease or sublease all or any portion of the Premises without Landlord’s consent, Tenant shall, upon the request of Landlord, provide and cause such assignee or sub-tenant to provide, such information (including, without limitation, any certification) as to any proposed assignee or sub-tenant and its principals as may be required for Landlord and Tenant to comply with regulations administered by OFAC or other governmental action regarding persons or entities with whom U.S. persons or entities are restricted from doing business.

^^Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after the execution and delivery of any assignation or sublease, deliver a duplicate original copy thereof to Landlord which, in the event of an assignation, shall be in a form capable of registration in the Books of Council and Session or an Extract Registered Copy of same. With respect to any assignation to any Preapproved Assignee or any Preapproved Sublease, at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such assignation or sublease, Tenant shall provide to Landlord information reasonably required by Landlord to establish that the Person involved in any such proposed assignation or sublease satisfies the criteria set forth in this Lease for a Preapproved Assignation or Preapproved Sublease.

^^During the continuation of any Breach Event, Landlord shall have the right upon notice to Tenant and any subtenants to collect all rents, issues and profits in connection with any subleases now in existence or hereafter entered into for any or all of the Premises, including any and all extensions, modifications and renewals thereof. Any amounts collected shall be applied to Rent payments next due and owing with any excess amounts paid to Tenant hereunder. Tenant shall not consent to, cause or allow any modification or alteration of any of the terms, conditions or undertakings of any of the subleases or the termination thereof, without the prior written approval of Landlord which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld nor shall Tenant accept any rents more than thirty (30) days in advance of the accrual thereof.

^^Tenant shall not have the power to grant any standard security, charge, pledge or otherwise encumber its interest under this Lease or any sublease of the Premises, and any such standard security, charge, pledge or encumbrance made in breach of this clause 12 shall be void and of no force and effect provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause 12.8 shall prevent the Tenant from including its interest in the Lease in a floating charge over all or substantially all of its assets in the case of a bank or major financial institution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall be entitled to grant a security over the whole of Tenant’s interest under this Lease provided that Landlord’s consent is first obtained, which consent shall require, without limitation, that (1) the terms of the security are first approved by Landlord, (ii) any conflict between the terms of the security and the terms of this Lease is resolved in favour of the terms of this Lease, and (iii) the security is granted in favour of a bank or other major financial institution.

^^Landlord may sell or transfer the Premises at any time without Tenant’s consent to any third party (each a Third Party Purchaser). In the event of any such transfer, Tenant shall be bound and obliged to any Third Party Purchaser as Landlord so long as such Third Party Purchaser and Landlord notify Tenant in writing of such transfer. At the request of Landlord, Tenant will execute such documents confirming the agreement referred to above and such other agreements as Landlord may reasonably request, provided that such agreements do not increase the liabilities and obligations of Tenant hereunder.

^^Tenant shall not, in a single transaction or series of transactions (including any merger or consolidation), sell or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets (an Asset Transfer) to any Person, and any such Asset Transfer shall be deemed an assignation in breach of this Lease; except that Tenant shall have the right to conduct an Asset Transfer to a Person without Landlord’s consent if the following conditions are met: the Asset Transfer is to a Person that (i) (A) immediately following such transaction or transactions, taken in, the aggregate, is (or would be, on a pro forma basis) a Credit Entity or (B) is approved in writing by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion or (C) (1) purchases all or substantially all of the assets of Tenant with the stated intention of continuing to operate the business of Tenant and (2) immediately after such transaction or transactions, taken in the aggregate, such Person has on a consolidated basis (or would, on a consolidated pro forma basis, have) for the Applicable Period (x) a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1.0 and (y) a Total Debt to EBITDAR Ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.0 (any such other Person under this clause 12.10(i)(C), an Asset Credit Entity); and (ii) this Lease is assigned to and assumed by such Person as a part of such Asset Transfer. In the event of an Asset Transfer to a member of Tenant’s Group, any subsequent sale of the assets of the original Tenant named herein by such member of Tenant’s Group shall be governed by the requirements of this clause 12.10 irrespective of whether or not such sale would be considered a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of such member of Tenant’s Group.

\centered PROVISIONS FOR RENT REVIEW 

In this Part 4 of the Schedule the following expressions have the following meanings: 

**Beginning Index** means the average Index for the calendar month in which the Commencement Date occurs; 

**First Rent Review Date** means the fifth anniversary of the Commencement Date. 

**Index** means the index known as the UK Consumer Price Index or the successor index that most closely approximates the Index; 

**Index Adjustment** means an adjustment of Basic Rent for the Index as calculated in accordance with clause 3 below; 

**Relevant Rent Review Date** means the Rent Review Date in respect of which the Basic Rent is to be adjusted; 

**Rent Review Dates** means the First Rent Review Date and each second anniversary of the First Rent Review Date thereafter during the Term. 

**Review** means a review of Basic Rent for Index as calculated in accordance with clause 3 below; 

^At each Relevant Rent Review Date the annual Basic Rent then in effect shall be increased by the Index Adjustment. In no circumstances shall the annual Basic Rent be reduced from the annual Basic Rent in effect immediately prior to each such review.

^If the Index shall be discontinued with no successor or comparable successor Index, the Landlord and the Tenant shall attempt to agree upon a substitute Index or formula, but if they are unable to so agree, then the matter shall be finally determined in the English language by an international accounting firm with offices in Scotland provided that if the Landlord and Tenant cannot agree on such firm, the Landlord and the Tenant shall have a coin toss and the winner of the coin toss shall make the selection of the accounting firm. Any decision or award resulting from such arbitration shall be final and binding upon the Landlord and the Tenant and judgement thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

^As of each Rent Review Date, an Index Adjustment shall be calculated as follows: when the average Index determined in clause (i) below exceeds, in the case of the first Review, the Beginning Index or, in the case of any subsequent Review, the Index as of the previous Rent Review Date, the Basic Rent in effect immediately prior to the applicable Rent Review Date shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the difference between (i) the Index for the most recent calendar month (the Prior Month) ending prior to such Rent Review Date for which the Index has been published on or before the forty-fifth (45 th) day preceding such Rent Review Date and (ii) in the case of the first Review, the Beginning Index or, in the case of any subsequent Review, the Index as of the previous Rent Review Date, and the denominator of which shall be, in the case of the first Review, the Beginning Index or, in the case of any subsequent Review, the Index as of the previous Rent Review Date. The product of such multiplication shall be added to the Basic Rent in effect immediately prior to such Rent Review Date. If the average Index determined in clause (i) is the same or less than, in the case of the first Review, the Beginning Index or, in the case of any subsequent Review, the Index as of the previous Rent Review Date, the annual Basic Rent will remain the same until the next Relevant Rent Review Date.

^Effective as of a given Rent Review Date, Basic Rent payable under this Lease until the next succeeding Rent Review Date shall be the Basic Rent in effect after the adjustment provided for as of such Rent Review Date.

^Notice of the new annual Basic Rent shall be delivered to the Tenant on or before the fifteenth (15th) day prior to each Rent Review Date, but any failure to do so by the Landlord shall not be or be deemed to be a waiver by the Landlord of the Landlord’s rights to collect such sums. The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord, within ten (10) days after a notice of the new annual Basic Rent is delivered to the Tenant, all amounts due from the Tenant, but unpaid, where notice of the stated amount as set forth above was not delivered to the Tenant at least fifteen (15) days preceding the Relevant Rent Review Date.

^The Guarantor PIPE ACQUISITION LIMITED (Company No. 05501083) HEREBY UNDERTAKES to the Landlord, (STEELS (UK) QRS 16-58, INC., a Company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and having an address care of W P Carey & Co LLC, [[Address 17: Address]], USA and its successors as landlord under the Lease aftermentioned) as guarantor, cautioner, co-obligant and principal debtor that the Tenant (MURRAY INTERNATIONAL METALS LIMITED (Company No. 1241058) having its Registered Office at 95 High Street, Edgeware, Middlesex HAS 7BD and its successors as Tenant under the said Lease) will observe and perform the obligations and conditions whatsoever (present and future) undertaken by or binding on the Tenant directly or indirectly under or by virtue of the Lease between the Landlord and the Tenant dated [ ] [[Date 6: Date]] (which Lease, as the same may be or may hereafter be amended or supplemented by agreement between the Landlord and the Tenant is herein called the Lease) relative to office premises and two warehouses (all with associated land and rights) at [[Address 7: Address]], Midlothian and that if the Tenant shall make any default in observing and performing the said obligations and conditions or any of them, then and in every such case the Guarantor will pay and make good to the Landlord on demand anything whatsoever which ought to be or have been paid, observed or performed as aforesaid as well as all damages, losses, and costs properly sustained by the Landlord through the default of the Tenant or the Guarantor PROVIDED ALWAYS that any neglect, delay or forbearance of the Landlord in enforcing observance of the Tenant’s obligations against the Tenant or the Guarantor or against any other guarantors of the Tenant’s obligations or the unenforceability of the obligations of the Tenant or any other guarantor (or the Tenant or any other such guarantor acting outwith their respective powers either in the entering into of the Lease or of the relevant Guarantee) or the giving of time by the Landlord to in relation thereto or any other act, matter or thing whereby, (but for this provision) the Guarantor would be exonerated either in whole or in part from its obligations to the Landlord (other than a discharge of the Guarantor’s obligations executed by the Landlord in writing) shall not release or in any way lessen or affect the liability of the Guarantor hereunder. 

^This Guarantee will apply not only to the obligations of the Tenant under the Lease but also to the obligations arising under any variation of the Lease executed by the Tenant and the Guarantor agrees, if requested (but without prejudice to the Guarantor’s obligations in the event that no such request is made), to be a party to any such variation as consentor. 

^The Guarantor HEREBY FURTHER UNDERTAKES with the Landlord that if:- 

^^The Tenant shall go into liquidation or administration or receivership and the Liquidator or Administrator or Receiver shall disclaim the Lease either expressly or by reason of failing to provide to the Landlord the personal undertaking required by Clause 13.1.2 of the Lease within the fourteen day period referred to in that Clause; or 

^^The Tenant shall be wound up or cease to exist; or 

^^an event shall occur which shall entitle the Landlord to irritate the Lease following due notice; then, at the option of the Landlord, the Guarantor will:- 

^^^procure that the Tenant renounces its right to the Lease; and 

^^^accept a new lease of the property leased by the Lease for a period equal to the remainder (which if there had been no disclaimer or if the Lease had continued to have had effect as aforesaid would have remained) of the period of the Lease at the same rent and subject to the like obligations and conditions as are provided for and contained in the Lease (subject to any variation which may then have occurred and to the provisions for further review of the rental provided for in the Lease); which new lease will take effect as from the date of the said disclaimer or entitlement to irritate; and 

^^^pay all costs properly and reasonably incurred by the Landlord in connection with the grant of the new lease and the renunciation.

^Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Landlord from exercising its rights in full under the Lease relative to any default by the Tenant and nothing herein contained will grant to the Guarantor any right of occupancy or other right to the leased subjects other than pursuant to a request by the Landlord under Condition 3 of this Guarantee. 

^The Guarantor in so far as it is not or may in the future not be subject to the jurisdiction of the Scottish Courts and the English Courts hereby prorogates and binds itself to submit to the non exclusive jurisdiction of both the Scottish Courts and the English Courts in relation to all actions at the instance of the Landlord arising out of or in connection with the Lease and this Guarantee and also in relation to all lawful execution which may follow as a result of the registration of the Lease and/or this Guarantee for execution and accepts that the choice of jurisdiction (Scotland or England) in which to bring or defend any proceedings or to take any enforcement steps shall in relation to each of such proceedings (and without prejudice to the use of the other jurisdiction for other proceedings or steps) be at the discretion of the Landlord. 

^The Landlord shall have the right to assign this Guarantee to its successors as landlords under the Lease. 

^The Guarantor accepts that it shall not be entitled to rank in the liquidation, bankruptcy or receivership of the Tenant in respect of any payment made by it under the Lease , the new Lease or this Guarantee nor to have any benefits of any securities held by the Landlord or of any payments dividends or composition which the Landlord may receive until the whole claims of the Landlord against the Tenant are satisfied.

If, for the purpose of obtaining in any judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert into lawful currency of Singapore (herein called Singapore Dollars) a sum due hereunder in Sterling or the lawful currency of Scotland, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures, the Landlord could purchase Sterling or the lawful currency of Scotland with Singapore Dollars at the spot exchange rate available in New York, New York (USA) on the business day on which a final judgment is given. The obligation of the Guarantor in respect of any such sum due hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in Singapore Dollars, be discharged only to the extent that on the business day following receipt by the Landlord of any sum adjudged to be so due in Singapore Dollars at the spot exchange rate available in New York, New York (USA), the Landlord may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase Sterling or the lawful currency of Scotland with Singapore Dollars; if the Sterling or the lawful currency of Scotland so purchased are less than the sum originally due in Sterling or the lawful currency of Scotland, the Guarantor agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Landlord against such loss and if Sterling or the lawful currency of Scotland so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Landlord in Sterling or the lawful currency of Scotland, the Landlord agrees to remit such excess to the Guarantor or its assigns. 

^The Guarantor makes (as at the date of this Guarantee only) the warranties set out in this Clause 11 to the Landlord. 

^^It is a company, duly incorporated and validly existing under the law of its jurisdiction of incorporation. 

^^It has the power to own its assets and carry on its business as it is being conducted. 

^^Subject to any general principles of law limiting its obligations and referred to in any legal opinion issued on behalf of the Guarantor with respect to this Guarantee on the date hereof, the obligations expressed to be assumed by it in this Guarantee are legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations. 

^^Subject to any general principles of law limiting its obligations and referred to in any legal opinion issued on behalf of the Guarantor with respect to this Guarantee on the date hereof; the entry into and performance by it of this Guarantee do not and will not conflict with: 

^^any law or regulation applicable to it; 

^^its constitutional documents; or 

^^that certain Indenture executed by and between the Tenant, the Guarantor and The Bank of New York, as trustee, dated [ ], 2005. 

^^It has the power to enter into, perform and deliver, and has taken all necessary action to authorise its entry into, performance and delivery of this Guarantee. 

^^All authorisations, consents, approvals, resolutions, licences, exemptions, filings, notarisations and registrations required: 

^^to enable it lawfully to enter into, exercise its rights and comply with its obligations in this Guarantee; and 

^^to make this Guarantee admissible in evidence in its jurisdiction of incorporation, have been obtained or effected and are in full force and effect. 

^^Its payment obligations under this Guarantee rank at least pari passu with the claims of all its other unsecured and unsubordinated creditors, except for obligations mandatorily preferred by law applying to companies generally. 

^^Subject to any general principles of law limiting its obligations and referred to in any legal opinion issued on behalf of the Guarantor with respect to this Guarantee on the date hereof: 

^^the choice of Scottish law as the governing law of this Guarantee will be recognised and enforced in its jurisdiction of incorporation. 

^^any judgment obtained in Scotland or England in relation to this Guarantee will be recognised and enforced in its jurisdiction of incorporation. 

^The Guarantor shall supply to the Landlord all documents required to be supplied by the Tenant and the Guarantor pursuant to Clause 2 of Part S of the Schedule to the Lease. 

^^^The Guarantor shall make all payments to be made by it without any deduction, withholding or set off whatsoever for or on account of any present and future taxes levies imposts duties fees charges or withholdings of whatever nature and wherever levied charged or assessed, together with any interest thereon and any fines surcharge or penalties in respect thereof (herein called a Tax Deduction), unless a Tax Deduction is required by law. 

^^The Guarantor shall promptly upon becoming aware that it must make a Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction) notify the Landlord accordingly. Similarly the Landlord shall notify the Guarantor on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to it. 

^^If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by the Guarantor, the amount of the payment due from the Guarantor shall be increased to an amount which, after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have become due if no Tax Deduction had been required. PROVIDED THAT the Guarantor shall not be liable to pay any such increase to the extent to which the Tax Deduction in question arises by reason of the Landlord’s failure in (a) completion of procedural formalities necessary to achieve the ability for non-resident Landlords to receive rents gross of deduction of tax at source under a scheme then capable of allowing the Landlord to achieve that on completion of such formalities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an application to HM Revenue & Customs for a certificate that the Landlord may receive rents gross of deduction at source) or (b) the provision to the Tenant and/or the Guarantor of a certificate or other suitable evidence that these formalities have been completed in reasonable time before the payment was required to be made under this Guarantee. 

^^If the Guarantor is required to make a Tax Deduction, it shall make that Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law. 

^^Within thirty days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction, the Guarantor shall deliver to the Landlord evidence that the Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid to the relevant taxing authority. 

^The Guarantor shall not, in a single transaction or series of transactions (including any merger or consolidation), sell or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets (excluding (a) the disposal of stock or cash on an arm’s length basis in the ordinary course of trading, (b) disposals of obsolete or redundant assets which are no longer required for the business of the Guarantor, (c) disposals of assets (other than any shares, heritable or leased properties in Scotland or any trade or business) in exchange for replacement assets comparable or superior as to type, value and quality) (herein called a Guarantor Asset Transfer) to any Person (as such term is defined in the Lease) unless this Guarantee is assigned to and assumed by such Person as a part of such Guarantor Asset Transfer, including all the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder, actual or contingent, and which may have arisen on or prior to the date of such assignation by a written instrument delivered to Landlord at the time of such Guarantor Asset Transfer. Upon any such assignation and assumption by any Person as a part of such Guarantor Asset Transfer in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the Guarantor hereunder shall, on the date of such assignation and assumption, be discharged from all liability under this Guarantee, but entirely without prejudice to the Landlord’s right and any assignee’s obligations hereunder, including those assumed by virtue of the instrument specified in this clause 14.
