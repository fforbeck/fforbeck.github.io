To this end, the Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units (including deferred stock units), unrestricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, and cash bonus awards. Any of these awards may, but need not, be made as performance incentives to reward attainment of annual or long-term performance goals in accordance with the terms hereof.

The Board shall have full power and authority to take all actions and to make all determinations required or provided for under the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement, and shall have full power and authority to take all such other actions and make all such other determinations not inconsistent with the specific terms and provisions of the Plan that the Board deems to be necessary or appropriate to the administration of the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement. All such actions and determinations shall be by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board present at a meeting or by unanimous consent of the Board executed in writing in accordance with the Company’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws and applicable law. The interpretation and construction by the Board of any provision of the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive. 

^^^^^ 
^^Committee  

The Board from time to time may delegate to the Committee such powers and authorities related to the administration and implementation of the Plan, as set forth in Section 3.1 above and other applicable provisions, as the Board shall determine, consistent with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company and applicable law. 

^^^Except as provided in Subsection (ii) and except as the Board may otherwise determine, the Committee, if any, appointed by the Board to administer the Plan shall consist of two or more Outside Directors of the Company who: (a) qualify as “outside directors” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and who (b) meet such other requirements as may be established from time to time by the Securities and Exchange Commission for plans intended to qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3 (or its successor) under the Exchange Act and who (c) comply with the independence requirements of the stock exchange on which the Common Stock is listed. 

^^^The Board may also appoint one or more separate committees of the Board, each composed of one or more directors of the Company who need not be Outside Directors, who may administer the Plan with respect to employees or other Service Providers who are not officers or directors of the Company, may grant Awards under the Plan to such employees or other Service Providers, and may determine all terms of such Awards. 

In the event that the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement entered into hereunder provides for any action to be taken by or determination to be made by the Board, such action may be taken or such determination may be made by the Committee if the power and authority to do so has been delegated to the Committee by the Board as provided for in this Section. Unless otherwise expressly determined by the Board, any such action or determination by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. To the extent permitted by law, the Committee may delegate its authority under the Plan to a member of the Board. Discretionary Awards made to Outside Directors under the Plan must be approved and administered by the Committee. 

^^Jurisdictions  

In order to assure the viability of Awards granted to Grantees employed in various jurisdictions, the Committee may provide for such special terms as it may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy, or custom applicable in the jurisdiction in which the Grantee resides or is employed. Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements to, or amendments, restatements, or alternative versions of, the Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes without thereby affecting the terms of the Plan as in effect for any other purpose; provided, however, that no such supplements, amendments, restatements, or alternative versions shall increase the share limitations contained in Section 4.1 of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate any Applicable Laws. 

^^Terms of Awards  

Subject to the other terms and conditions of the Plan, the Board shall have full and final authority to: 

^^^designate Grantees,  

^^^determine the type or types of Awards to be made to a Grantee, 

^^^^^ 
^^^determine the number of shares of Stock to be subject to an Award, 

^^^establish the terms and conditions of each Award (including, but not limited to, the exercise price of any Option, the nature and duration of any restriction or condition (or provision for lapse thereof) relating to the vesting, exercise, transfer, or forfeiture of an Award or the shares of Stock subject thereto, the treatment of an Award in the event of a change of control, and any terms or conditions that may be necessary to qualify Options as Incentive Stock Options), 

^^^prescribe the form of each Award Agreement evidencing an Award, and 

^^^amend, modify, or supplement the terms of any outstanding Award. Such authority specifically includes the authority, in order to effectuate the purposes of the Plan but without amending the Plan, to make or modify Awards to U.S. Grantees and eligible individuals who are foreign nationals or are individuals who are employed outside the United States to recognize differences in local law, tax policy, or custom. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, modification or supplement of any Award shall, without the consent of the Grantee, impair the Grantee’s rights under such Award. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any provision of any Award Agreement, if the Company is required to prepare a material accounting restatement, then the Board shall have the discretion to determine whether any Grantee shall forfeit any Award, in whole or in part, including any cash or shares of Stock received in connection with such Award (or an amount equal to the fair market value of such Stock on the date of delivery if the Grantee no longer holds the shares of Stock) if: (1) the Board or Committee, in their sole discretion, determines that the Grantee engaged in misconduct relating to such accounting restatement, (2) pursuant to the terms of the Award Agreement for such Award, the amount of the Award earned or the vesting in the Award was explicitly based on the achievement of pre-established performance goals set forth in the Award Agreement (including earnings, gains, or other criteria) that are later determined, as a result of the accounting restatement, not to have been achieved, and (3) the Award was earned within the three (3) years following the date of the first public issuance or filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the financial statements that subsequently required restatement. In determining the amount of forfeiture, the Company shall credit the Grantee with any taxes already paid in connection with such Award. 

In addition, if, at any time within one (1) year after the date on which a Grantee exercises an Option or SAR, or receives payment of a Short-Term Incentive Award, Long-Term Incentive Award, or on which Restricted Shares or Stock Units vest or on which income is realized by a Grantee in connection with any other Award (each of which events shall be a “realization event”), the Board determines in its discretion that the Company has been materially harmed by the Grantee, whether such harm (a) results in the Grantee’s termination or deemed termination of employment for Cause or (b) results from any activity of the Grantee determined by the Board to be in competition with any activity of the Company, or otherwise prejudicial, contrary or harmful to the interests of the Company (including, but not limited to, accepting employment with or serving as a consultant, adviser or in any other capacity to an entity that is in competition with or acting against the interests of the Company), then any gain realized by the Grantee from the realization event shall be paid by the Grantee to the Company upon notice from the Company. Such gain shall be determined as of the date of the realization event, without regard to any subsequent change in the Fair Market Value of the Stock. The Company shall have the right to offset such gain against any amounts otherwise owed to the Grantee by the Company (whether as wages, vacation pay, or pursuant to any benefit plan or other compensatory arrangement). 

^^^^^ 
^^No Repricing  

Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, no amendment or modification may be made to an outstanding Option or SAR, including, without limitation, by replacement of Options or SARs with cash or other award type, that would be treated as a repricing under the rules of the stock exchange on which the Stock is listed, in each case, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, provided, that, appropriate adjustments may be made to outstanding Options and SARs pursuant to Section 17 or Section 5.3 and may be made to make changes to achieve compliance with applicable law, including Code Section 409A. 

^^Deferral Arrangement  

The Board may permit or require the deferral of any award payment into a deferred compensation arrangement, subject to such rules and procedures as it may establish, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of interest or dividend equivalents, including converting such credits into deferred Stock equivalents. Any such deferrals shall be made in a manner that complies with Code Section 409A. 

^^No Liability  

No member of the Board or the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Award or Award Agreement. 

^^Share Issuance/Book-Entry  

Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, the issuance of the Stock under the Plan may be evidenced in such a manner as the Board, in its discretion, deems appropriate, including, without limitation, book-entry registration or issuance of one or more Stock certificates. 

^STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN  

^^Number of Shares Available for Awards 

Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 17 hereof, the number of shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be the sum of (i) up to two million (2,000,000) shares and (ii) the number of shares remaining as of the date that this Plan is approved by the Company’s stockholders under the Prior Plan and increased by shares of Stock covered by awards granted under the Prior Plan that are not purchased or are forfeited or expire, or otherwise terminate without delivery of any Stock subject thereto, to the extent such shares would again be available for issuance under such Prior Plan. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 17 hereof, the number of shares of Stock available for issuance as Incentive Stock Options shall be two million (2,000,000). Stock issued or to be issued under the Plan shall be authorized but unissued shares; or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, issued shares that have been reacquired by the Company. 

^^Adjustments in Authorized Shares  

The Board shall have the right to substitute or assume Awards in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies. The number of shares of Stock reserved pursuant to Section 4 shall be increased by the corresponding number of Awards assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of shares of Stock subject to Awards before and after the substitution. 

^^^^^ 
^^Share Usage  

Shares covered by an Award shall be counted as used as of the Grant Date. Any shares of Stock that are subject to Awards shall be counted against the limit set forth in Section 4.1 as one (1) share for every one (1) share subject to an Award. With respect to SARs, the number of shares subject to an award of SARs will be counted against the aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the Plan regardless of the number of shares actually issued to settle the SAR upon exercise. If any shares covered by an Award granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan are not purchased or are forfeited or expire, or if an Award otherwise terminates without delivery of any Stock subject thereto or is settled in cash in lieu of shares, then the number of shares of Stock counted against the aggregate number of shares available under the Plan with respect to such Award shall, to the extent of any such forfeiture, termination or expiration, again be available for making Awards under the Plan in the same amount as such shares were counted against the limit set forth in Section 4.1. The number of shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall not be increased by (i) any shares of Stock tendered or withheld or Award surrendered in connection with the purchase of shares of Stock upon exercise of an Option as described in Section 13, (ii) any shares of Stock deducted or delivered from an Award payment in connection with the Company’s tax withholding obligations as described in Section 18.3, or (iii) any shares of Stock repurchased by the Company using proceeds from the purchase of shares of Stock upon exercise of an Option as described in Section 13. 

^EFFECTIVE DATE, DURATION AND AMENDMENTS 

^^Effective Date  

The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date, subject to approval of the Plan by the Company’s stockholders within one year of the Effective Date. Upon approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company as set forth above, all Awards made under the Plan on or after the Effective Date shall be fully effective as if the stockholders of the Company had approved the Plan on the Effective Date. If the stockholders fail to approve the Plan within one year of the Effective Date, any Awards made hereunder shall be null and void and of no effect. Following the date the Plan is approved by the Company’s stockholders, no awards will be made under the Prior Plan. 

^^Term  

The Plan shall terminate automatically ten (10) years after the Effective Date and may be terminated on any earlier date as provided in Section 5.3. 

^^Amendment and Termination of the Plan 

The Board may, at any time and from time to time, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan as to any shares of Stock as to which Awards have not been made; provided however, that the Company shall submit for stockholder approval any amendment required to be submitted for stockholder approval by Applicable Law or applicable stock exchange listing requirements, or that would otherwise materially: (i) increase the benefits accrued to Participants under the Plan, (ii) increase the numbers of securities which may be issued under the Plan (other than an increase pursuant to the adjustment provisions of Section 17), or (iii) modify the requirements for participation in the Plan. No amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall, without the consent of the Grantee, impair rights or obligations under any Award theretofore awarded under the Plan.

Subject to this Section 6, Awards may be made under the Plan to: (i) any Service Provider to the Company or of any Affiliate, including any Service Provider who is an officer or director of the Company, or of any Affiliate, as the Board shall determine and designate from time to time and (ii) any other individual whose participation in the Plan is determined to be in the best interests of the Company by the Board. 

^^Adjustments in Authorized Shares  

An eligible person may receive more than one Award, subject to such restrictions as are provided herein. The Board shall have the right to substitute or assume Awards in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies. The number of shares of Stock reserved pursuant to Section 4 shall be increased by the corresponding number of Substitute Awards. 

^^Limitation on Shares of Stock Subject to Awards and Cash Awards. 

During any time when the Company has a class of equity security registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and the transition period under Treasury Reg. section 1.162-27(f)(2) has lapsed or does not apply: 

^^^the maximum number of shares of Stock subject to Options or SARs that can be awarded under the Plan to any person eligible for an Award under Section 6 hereof is four hundred thousand (400,000) per calendar year; 

^^^the maximum number of shares that can be awarded under the Plan, other than pursuant to an Option or SARs, to any person eligible for an Award under Section 6 hereof is four hundred thousand (400,000) per calendar year; and 

^^^the maximum amount that may be earned as an Short-Term Incentive Award or other cash Award in any calendar year by any one Grantee shall be four million dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]) and the maximum amount that may be earned as a Long-Term Incentive Award or other cash Award in respect of a performance period by any one Grantee shall be seven millions dollars ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]). 

The preceding limitations in this Section 6.3 are subject to adjustment as provided in Section 17 hereof. 

^AWARD AGREEMENT  

Each Award granted pursuant to the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement, in such form or forms as the Board shall from time to time determine. Award Agreements granted from time to time or at the same time need not contain similar provisions but shall be consistent with the terms of the Plan. Each Award Agreement evidencing an Award of Options shall specify whether such Options are intended to be Non-qualified Stock Options or Incentive Stock Options, and in the absence of such specification such options shall be deemed Non-qualified Stock Options. 

^^^^^ 
^TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS  

^^Option Price  

The Option Price of each Option shall be fixed by the Board and stated in the Award Agreement evidencing such Option. Except in the case of Substitute Awards, the Option Price of each Option shall be at least the Fair Market Value on the Grant Date of a share of Stock; provided, however, that in the event that a Grantee is a Ten Percent Stockholder, the Option Price of an Option granted to such Grantee that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Grant Date. In no case shall the Option Price of any Option be less than the par value of a share of Stock. 

^^Vesting  

Subject to **Sections 8.3 and 17.3** hereof, each Option granted under the Plan shall become exercisable at such times and under such conditions as shall be determined by the Board and stated in the Award Agreement. For purposes of this Section 8.2, fractional numbers of shares of Stock subject to an Option shall be rounded down to the next nearest whole number. 

^^Term  

Each Option granted under the Plan shall terminate, and all rights to purchase shares of Stock thereunder shall cease, upon the expiration of ten years from the date such Option is granted, or under such circumstances and on such date prior thereto as is set forth in the Plan or as may be fixed by the Board and stated in the Award Agreement relating to such Option; provided, however, that in the event that the Grantee is a Ten Percent Stockholder, an Option granted to such Grantee that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall not be exercisable after the expiration of five years from its Grant Date. If on the day preceding the date on which a Grantee’s Options would otherwise terminate, the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock underlying a Grantee’s Options is greater than the Option Price of such Options, the Company shall, prior to the termination of such Options and without any action being taken on the part of the Grantee, consider such Options to have been exercised by the Grantee. The Company shall deduct from the shares of Stock deliverable to the Grantee upon such exercise the number of shares of Stock necessary to satisfy payment of the Option Price and all withholding obligations. 

^^Termination of Service  

Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement, the Grantee shall have the right to exercise the Option for ninety (90) days following termination of the Grantee’s Service, unless terminated for Cause, in which case there shall be no post-termination exercise period. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months after termination of the Grantee’s Service due to death or Disability. The post-termination provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Board, need not be uniform among all Options issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of Service. 

^^Limitations on Exercise of Option  

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, in no event may any Option be exercised, in whole or in part, prior to the date the Plan is approved by the stockholders of the Company as provided herein or after the occurrence of an event referred to in Section 17 hereof which results in termination of the Option. 

^^^^^ 
^^Method of Exercise  

Subject to the terms of Section 13 and Section 18.3, an Option that is exercisable may be exercised by the Grantee’s delivery to the Company of notice of exercise on any business day, at the Company’s principal office, on the form specified by the Company. Such notice shall specify the number of shares of Stock with respect to which the Option is being exercised and shall be accompanied by payment in full of the Option Price of the shares for which the Option is being exercised plus the amount (if any) of federal and/or other taxes which the Company may, in its judgment, be required to withhold with respect to an Award. 

^^Rights of Holders of Options  

Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement, an individual holding or exercising an Option shall have none of the rights of a stockholder (for example, the right to receive cash or dividend payments or distributions attributable to the subject shares of Stock or to direct the voting of the subject shares of Stock) until the shares of Stock covered thereby are fully paid and issued to him. Except as provided in Section 17 hereof, no adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date of such issuance. 

^^Delivery of Stock Certificates  

Promptly after the exercise of an Option by a Grantee and the payment in full of the Option Price, such Grantee shall be entitled to the issuance of a stock certificate or certificates evidencing his or her ownership of the shares of Stock subject to the Option. 

^^Transferability of Options  

Except as provided in Section 8.10, during the lifetime of a Grantee, only the Grantee (or, in the event of legal incapacity or incompetency, the Grantee’s guardian or legal representative) may exercise an Option. Except as provided in Section 8.10, no Option shall be assignable or transferable by the Grantee to whom it is granted, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 

^^Family Transfers  

If authorized in the applicable Award Agreement, a Grantee may transfer, not for value, all or part of an Option which is not an Incentive Stock Option to any Family Member. For the purpose of this Section 8.10, a “not for value” transfer is a transfer which is (i) a gift, (ii) a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights; or (iii) unless applicable law does not permit such transfers, a transfer to an entity in which more than fifty percent of the voting interests are owned by Family Members (or the Grantee) in exchange for an interest in that entity. Following a transfer under this Section 8.10, any such Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer, and shares of Stock acquired pursuant to the Option shall be subject to the same restrictions on transfer of shares as would have applied to the Grantee. Subsequent transfers of transferred Options are prohibited except to Family Members of the original Grantee in accordance with this Section 8.10 or by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The events of termination of Service of Section 8.4 hereof shall continue to be applied with respect to the original Grantee, following which the Option shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and for the periods specified, in Section 8.4. 

^^^^^ 
^^Limitations on Incentive Stock Options 

An Option shall constitute an Incentive Stock Option only (i) if the Grantee of such Option is an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company; (ii) to the extent specifically provided in the related Award Agreement; and (iii) to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of the shares of Stock with respect to which all Incentive Stock Options held by such Grantee become exercisable for the first time during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other plans of the Grantee’s employer and its Affiliates) does not exceed $[[USD Value 3: Number]] This limitation shall be applied by taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted. 

^^Notice of Disqualifying Disposition 

If any Grantee shall make any disposition of shares of Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option under the circumstances described in Code Section 421(b) (relating to certain disqualifying dispositions), such Grantee shall notify the Company of such disposition within ten (10) days thereof. 

^TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS 

^^Right to Payment and Grant Price  

^SAR shall confer on the Grantee to whom it is granted a right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock on the date of exercise over (B) the grant price of the SAR as determined by the Board. The Award Agreement for a SAR shall specify the grant price of the SAR, which shall be at least the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant. SARs may be granted in conjunction with all or part of an Option granted under the Plan or at any subsequent time during the term of such Option, in conjunction with all or part of any other Award or without regard to any Option or other Award; provided that a SAR that is granted subsequent to the Grant Date of a related Option must have a SAR Price that is no less than the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock on the SAR Grant Date. 

^^Other Terms  

The Board shall determine at the date of grant or thereafter, the time or times at which and the circumstances under which a SAR may be exercised in whole or in part (including based on achievement of performance goals and/or future service requirements), the time or times at which SARs shall cease to be or become exercisable following termination of Service or upon other conditions, the method of exercise, method of settlement, form of consideration payable in settlement, method by or forms in which Stock will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Grantees, whether or not a SAR shall be in tandem or in combination with any other Award, and any other terms and conditions of any SAR. 

^^Term  

Each SAR granted under the Plan shall terminate, and all rights thereunder shall cease, upon the expiration of ten years from the date such SAR is granted, or under such circumstances and on such date prior thereto as is set forth in the Plan or as may be fixed by the Board and stated in the Award Agreement relating to such SAR. 

^^^^^ 
^^Transferability of SARS  

Except as provided in Section 9.5, during the lifetime of a Grantee, only the Grantee (or, in the event of legal incapacity or incompetency, the Grantee’s guardian or legal representative) may exercise a SAR. Except as provided in Section 9.5, no SAR shall be assignable or transferable by the Grantee to whom it is granted, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 

^^Family Transfers  

If authorized in the applicable Award Agreement, a Grantee may transfer, not for value, all or part of a SAR to any Family Member. For the purpose of this Section 9.5, a “not for value” transfer is a transfer which is (i) a gift, (ii) a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights; or (iii) unless applicable law does not permit such transfers, a transfer to an entity in which more than fifty percent of the voting interests are owned by Family Members (or the Grantee) in exchange for an interest in that entity. Following a transfer under this Section 9.5, any such SAR shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer, and shares of Stock acquired pursuant to a SAR shall be subject to the same restrictions on transfer or shares as would have applied to the Grantee. Subsequent transfers of transferred SARs are prohibited except to Family Members of the original Grantee in accordance with this Section 9.5 or by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 

^TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND STOCK UNITS 

^^Grant of Restricted Stock or Stock Units 

Awards of Restricted Stock or Stock Units may be made for no consideration (other than par value of the shares which is deemed paid by Services already rendered). 

^^Restrictions  

At the time a grant of Restricted Stock or Stock Units is made, the Board may, in its sole discretion, establish a period of time (a “restricted period”) applicable to such Restricted Stock or Stock Units. Each Award of Restricted Stock or Stock Units may be subject to a different restricted period. The Board may in its sole discretion, at the time a grant of Restricted Stock or Stock Units is made, prescribe restrictions in addition to or other than the expiration of the restricted period, including the satisfaction of corporate or individual performance objectives, which may be applicable to all or any portion of the Restricted Stock or Stock Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Restricted Stock and Stock Units that vest solely by the passage of time shall not vest in full in less than three (3) years from the grant date (provided, however, Restricted Stock and Stock Units may vest pro-rata during that period and vesting may accelerate on death, Disability or a Corporate Transaction), and (ii) Restricted Stock and Stock Units for which vesting may be accelerated by achieving performance targets shall not vest in full in less than one (1) year from the grant date (provided, however, vesting may accelerate on death, Disability or a Corporate Transaction); provided, however, up to ten percent of the shares reserved for issuance under this Plan may be granted pursuant to this Section 10 or the other provisions of this Plan without being subject to the foregoing restrictions. Neither Restricted Stock nor Stock Units may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the restricted period or prior to the satisfaction of any other restrictions prescribed by the Board with respect to such Restricted Stock or Stock Units. 

^^^^^ 
^^Restricted Stock Certificates  

The Company shall issue, in the name of each Grantee to whom Restricted Stock has been granted, stock certificates representing the total number of shares of Restricted Stock granted to the Grantee, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Grant Date. The Board may provide in an Award Agreement that either (i) the Secretary of the Company shall hold such certificates for the Grantee’s benefit until such time as the Restricted Stock is forfeited to the Company or the restrictions lapse, or (ii) such certificates shall be delivered to the Grantee, provided, however, that such certificates shall bear a legend or legends that comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and makes appropriate reference to the restrictions imposed under the Plan and the Award Agreement.

The Board may provide that any dividends paid on Restricted Stock must be reinvested in shares of Stock, which may or may not be subject to the same vesting conditions and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock. All distributions, if any, received by a Grantee with respect to Restricted Stock as a result of any stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares, or other similar transaction shall be subject to the restrictions applicable to the original Grant. 

^^Rights of Holders of Stock Units  

**10.5.1. Voting and Dividend Rights**  

Holders of Stock Units shall have no rights as stockholders of the Company. The Board may provide in an Award Agreement evidencing a grant of Stock Units that the holder of such Stock Units shall be entitled to receive, upon the Company’s payment of a cash dividend on its outstanding Stock, a cash payment for each Stock Unit held equal to the per-share dividend paid on the Stock. Such Award Agreement may also provide that such cash payment will be deemed reinvested in additional Stock Units at a price per unit equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date that such dividend is paid. 

**10.5.2. Creditor’s Rights**  

^holder of Stock Units shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Award Agreement. 

^^Termination of Service  

Unless the Board otherwise provides in an Award Agreement or in writing after the Award Agreement is issued, upon the termination of a Grantee’s Service, any Restricted Stock or Stock Units held by such Grantee that have not vested, or with respect to which all applicable restrictions and conditions have not lapsed, shall immediately be deemed forfeited. Upon forfeiture of Restricted Stock or Stock Units, the Grantee shall have no further rights with respect to such Award, including but not limited to any right to vote Restricted Stock or any right to receive dividends with respect to shares of Restricted Stock or Stock Units. Notwithstanding the terms of this Section 10.6, but subject to the ten percent limitation set forth in Section 10.2, the Board may not waive restrictions or conditions applicable to Restricted Stock or Stock Units except in the case of a Grantee’s death, Disability or a Corporate Transaction or as specified in Section 18.3. If the Board waives restrictions or conditions applicable to Restricted Stock or Stock Units, the shares subject to 

^^^^^ 
such Restricted Stock or Stock Units shall be deducted from the ten percent limitation set forth in Section 10.2. 

^^Purchase of Restricted Stock and Shares Subject to Stock Units 

The Grantee shall be required, to the extent required by applicable law, to purchase the Restricted Stock or shares of Stock subject to vested Stock Units from the Company at a Purchase Price equal to the greater of (i) the aggregate par value of the shares of Stock represented by such Restricted Stock or Stock Units and (ii) the Purchase Price, if any, specified in the Award Agreement relating to such Restricted Stock or Stock Units. The Purchase Price shall be payable in a form described in Section 13 or, in the discretion of the Board, in consideration for past or future Services rendered to the Company or an Affiliate. 

^^Delivery of Stock  

Upon the expiration or termination of any restricted period and the satisfaction of any other conditions prescribed by the Board, the restrictions applicable to shares of Restricted Stock or Stock Units settled in Stock shall lapse, and, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, a stock certificate for such shares shall be delivered, free of all such restrictions, to the Grantee or the Grantee’s beneficiary or estate, as the case may be. Neither the Grantee, nor the Grantee’s beneficiary or estate, shall have any further rights with regard to a Stock Unit once the share of Stock represented by the Stock Unit has been delivered. 

^TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF UNRESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS 

The Board may, in its sole discretion, grant (or sell at par value or such other higher purchase price determined by the Board) an Unrestricted Stock Award to any Grantee pursuant to which such Grantee may receive shares of Stock free of any restrictions (“Unrestricted Stock”) under the Plan; provided, however, that in the aggregate, no more than ten percent of the shares reserved for issuance under this Plan may be granted pursuant to this Section 11 and the exceptions set forth in Section 10.2 and Section 10.6. Unrestricted Stock Awards may be granted or sold as described in the preceding sentence in respect of past services and other valid consideration, or in lieu of, or in addition to, any cash compensation due to such Grantee. 

^TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS 

^^Dividend Equivalent Rights  

^Dividend Equivalent Right is an Award entitling the recipient to receive credits based on cash distributions that would have been paid on the shares of Stock specified in the Dividend Equivalent Right (or other award to which it relates) if such shares had been issued to and held by the recipient. A Dividend Equivalent Right may be granted hereunder to any Grantee. The terms and conditions of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be specified in the grant. Dividend equivalents credited to the holder of a Dividend Equivalent Right may be paid currently or may be deemed to be reinvested in additional shares of Stock, which may thereafter accrue additional equivalents. Any such reinvestment shall be at Fair Market Value on the date of reinvestment. Dividend Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or Stock or a combination thereof, in a single installment or installments, all determined in the sole discretion of the Board. A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall be settled upon exercise, settlement, or payment of, or lapse of restrictions on, such other award, and that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall expire or be forfeited or annulled under the same conditions as such other award. A Dividend Equivalent Right 

^^^^^ 
granted as a component of another Award may also contain terms and conditions different from such other award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of a Performance Share or Performance Unit award shall not settle prior to payment of such Performance Share or Performance Unit award and shall expire or be forfeited and annulled under the same conditions as such Performance Share or Performance Unit award. 

^^Termination of Service  

Except as may otherwise be provided by the Board either in the Award Agreement or in writing after the Award Agreement is issued, a Grantee’s rights in all Dividend Equivalent Rights or interest equivalents shall automatically terminate upon the Grantee’s termination of Service for any reason. 

^PAYMENT  

^^General Rule.  

Payment of the Option Price for the shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option or the Purchase Price for Restricted Stock shall be made in cash or in cash equivalents acceptable to the Company. 

^^Surrender of Stock.  

To the extent the Award Agreement so provides, payment of the Option Price for shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option or the Purchase Price for Restricted Stock may be made all or in part through the tender or attestation to the Company of shares of Stock, which shall be valued, for purposes of determining the extent to which the Option Price or Purchase Price has been paid thereby, at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise or surrender. 

^^Cashless Exercise.  

With respect to an Option only (and not with respect to Restricted Stock), to the extent permitted by law and to the extent the Award Agreement so provides, payment of the Option Price for shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option may be made all or in part by delivery (on a form acceptable to the Board) of an irrevocable direction to a licensed securities broker acceptable to the Company to sell shares of Stock and to deliver all or part of the sales proceeds to the Company in payment of the Option Price and any withholding taxes described in Section 18.3, or, with the consent of the Company, by issuing the number of shares equal in value to the difference between the Option Price and the Fair Market Value of the shares subject to the portion of the Option being exercised. 

^^Other Forms of Payment.  

To the extent the Award Agreement so provides and/or unless otherwise specified in an Award Agreement, payment of the Option Price for shares purchased pursuant to exercise of an Option or the Purchase Price for Restricted Stock may be made in any other form that is consistent with applicable laws, regulations and rules, including, without limitation, Service. 

^^^^^ 

^**TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES, PERFORMANCE UNITS, LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS AND SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS**

^^Grant of Performance Units/Performance Shares. 

Subject to the terms and provisions of this Plan, the Board, at any time and from time to time, may grant Performance Units and/or Performance Shares to Grantees in such amounts and upon such terms as the Committee shall determine. 

^^Value of Performance Units/Performance Shares. 

Each Performance Unit shall have an initial value that is established by the Board at the time of grant. Each Performance Share shall have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. The Board shall set performance goals in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the value and/or number of Performance Units/Performance Shares that will be paid out to the Grantee. 

^^Earning of Performance Units/Performance Shares. 

Subject to the terms of this Plan, after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Performance Shares shall be entitled to receive payout on the value and number of Performance Units/Performance Shares earned by the Grantee over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved. 

^^Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units/Performance Shares. 

Payment of earned Performance Units/Performance Shares shall be as determined by the Board and as evidenced in the Award Agreement. Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Board, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Units/Performance Shares in the form of cash or in shares (or in a combination thereof) equal to the value of the earned Performance Units/Performance Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period, or as soon as practicable after the end of the Performance Period. Any shares of Stock may be granted subject to any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Committee. The determination of the Committee with respect to the form of payout of such Awards shall be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the Award. 

^^Performance Conditions.  

The right of a Grantee to exercise or receive a grant or settlement of any Award, and the timing thereof, may be subject to such performance conditions as may be specified by the Board. The Board may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions. If and to the extent required under Code Section 162(m), any power or authority relating to an Award intended to qualify under Code Section 162(m), shall be exercised by the Committee and not the Board. 

^^^^^ 
^^**Long-Term Incentive Awards or Short-Term Incentive Awards Granted to Designated Covered Employees.**

If and to the extent that the Board determines that an Award to be granted to a Grantee who is designated by the Committee as likely to be a Covered Employee should qualify as “performance-based compensation” for purposes of Code Section 162(m), the grant, exercise and/or settlement of such Award shall be contingent upon achievement of pre-established performance goals and other terms set forth in this Section 14.6. 

**14.6.1.**      **Performance Goals Generally.**

The performance goals for such Awards shall consist of one or more business criteria and a targeted level or levels of performance with respect to each of such criteria, as specified by the Committee consistent with this Section 14.6. Performance goals shall be objective and shall otherwise meet the requirements of Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder including the requirement that the level or levels of performance targeted by the Committee result in the achievement of performance goals being “substantially uncertain.” The Committee may determine that such Awards shall be granted, exercised and/or settled upon achievement of any one performance goal or that two or more of the performance goals must be achieved as a condition to grant, exercise and/or settlement of such Awards. Performance goals may differ for Awards granted to any one Grantee or to different Grantees. 

**14.6.2.**      **Timing For Establishing Performance Goals.**

Performance goals shall be established not later than 90 days after the beginning of any performance period applicable to such Awards, or at such other date as may be required or permitted for “performance-based compensation” under Code Section 162(m). 

**14.6.3.**      **Settlement of Awards; Other Terms.**

Settlement of such Awards shall be in cash, Stock, other Awards or other property, in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of a settlement otherwise to be made in connection with such Awards. The Committee shall specify the circumstances in which such Long-Term or Short-Term Incentive Awards shall be paid or forfeited in the event of termination of Service by the Grantee prior to the end of a performance period or settlement of Awards. 

**14.6.4.**      **Performance Measures.**

The performance goals upon which the payment or vesting of an Award to a Covered Employee that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation shall be limited to the following Performance Measures: 

^^net earnings or net income;  
^^operating earnings;  
^^pretax earnings;  
^^earnings per share;  

^^^^^ 
^^share price, including growth measures and total stockholder return; 

^^earnings before interest and taxes;  
^^earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization; 

^^sales or revenue growth, whether in general, by type of product or service, or by type of customer; 

^^gross or operating margins;  
^^return measures, including return on assets, capital, investment, equity, sales or revenue; 

^^cash flow, including operating cash flow, free cash flow, cash flow return on equity and cash flow return on investment; 

^^productivity ratios;  
^^expense targets;  
^^market share;  
^^financial ratios as provided in credit agreements of the Company and its subsidiaries; 

^^working capital targets;  
^^completion of acquisitions of business or companies. 

^^completion of divestitures and asset sales; and 

^^any combination of any of the foregoing business criteria. 

Any Performance Measure(s) may be used to measure the performance of the Company, Subsidiary, and/or Affiliate as a whole or any business unit of the Company, Subsidiary, and/or Affiliate or any combination thereof, as the Committee may deem appropriate, or any of the above Performance Measures as compared to the performance of a group of comparator companies, or published or special index that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate, or the Company may select Performance Measure (f) above as compared to various stock market indices. The Committee also has the authority to provide for accelerated vesting of any Award based on the achievement of performance goals pursuant to the Performance Measures specified in this Section 14. 

^^^^^ 
**14.6.5.**      **Evaluation of Performance.**

The Committee may provide in any such Award that any evaluation of performance may include or exclude any of the following events that occur during a Performance Period: (a) asset write-downs; (b) litigation or claim judgments or settlements; (c) the effect of changes in tax laws, accounting principles, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results; (d) any reorganization and restructuring programs; (e) extraordinary nonrecurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 and/or in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in the Company’s annual report to shareholders for the applicable year; (f) acquisitions or divestitures; (g) foreign exchange gains and losses; (h) award expense related to the restricted stock units awarded in [[Date 2: Date]] pursuant to the Prior Plan; (i) tax valuation allowance reversals; (j) impairment expense; and (k) environmental expense. To the extent such inclusions or exclusions affect Awards to Covered Employees, they shall be prescribed in a form that meets the requirements of Code Section 162(m) for deductibility. 

**14.6.6.**      **Adjustment of Performance-Based Compensation.**

Awards that are intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation may not be adjusted upward. The Board shall retain the discretion to adjust such Awards downward, either on a formula or discretionary basis, or any combination as the Committee determines. 

**14.6.7.**      **Board Discretion.**

In the event that applicable tax and/or securities laws change to permit Board discretion to alter the governing Performance Measures without obtaining shareholder approval of such changes, the Board shall have sole discretion to make such changes without obtaining shareholder approval provided the exercise of such discretion does not violate Code Section 409A. In addition, in the event that the Committee determines that it is advisable to grant Awards that shall not qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee may make such grants without satisfying the requirements of Code Section 162(m) and base vesting on Performance Measures other than those set forth in Section 14.6.4. 

^^**Status of Section Awards Under Code Section** **162(m)****.**

It is the intent of the Company that Awards under Section 14.6 hereof granted to persons who are designated by the Committee as likely to be Covered Employees within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder shall, if so designated by the Committee, constitute “qualified performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, the terms of Section 14.6, including the definitions of Covered Employee and other terms used therein, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder. The foregoing notwithstanding, because the Committee cannot determine with certainty whether a given Grantee will be a Covered Employee with respect to a fiscal year that has not yet been completed, the term Covered Employee as used herein shall mean only a person designated by the Committee, at the time of grant of an Award, as likely to be a Covered Employee with respect to that fiscal year. If any provision of the Plan or any agreement relating to such Awards does not comply or is inconsistent with the requirements of Code Section 162(m) or regulations thereunder, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements. 

^PARACHUTE LIMITATIONS  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or of any other agreement, contract, or understanding heretofore or hereafter entered into by a U.S. Grantee with the Company or any Affiliate, 

^^^^^ 
except an agreement, contract, or understanding that expressly addresses Section 280G or Section 4999 of the Code (an “Other Agreement”), and notwithstanding any formal or informal plan or other arrangement for the direct or indirect provision of compensation to the U.S. Grantee (including groups or classes of U.S. Grantees or beneficiaries of which the U.S. Grantee is a member), whether or not such compensation is deferred, is in cash, or is in the form of a benefit to or for the U.S. Grantee (a “Benefit Arrangement”), if the U.S. Grantee is a “disqualified individual,” as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code, any Option, Restricted Stock, Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit held by that U.S. Grantee and any right to receive any payment or other benefit under this Plan shall not become exercisable or vested (i) to the extent that such right to exercise, vesting, payment, or benefit, taking into account all other rights, payments, or benefits to or for the U.S. Grantee under this Plan, all Other Agreements, and all Benefit Arrangements, would cause any payment or benefit to the U.S. Grantee under this Plan to be considered a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code as then in effect (a “Parachute Payment”) and (ii) if, as a result of receiving a Parachute Payment, the aggregate after-tax amounts received by the U.S. Grantee from the Company under this Plan, all Other Agreements, and all Benefit Arrangements would be less than the maximum after-tax amount that could be received by the U.S. Grantee without causing any such payment or benefit to be considered a Parachute Payment. In the event that the receipt of any such right to exercise, vesting, payment, or benefit under this Plan, in conjunction with all other rights, payments, or benefits to or for the U.S. Grantee under any Other Agreement or any Benefit Arrangement would cause the U.S. Grantee to be considered to have received a Parachute Payment under this Plan that would have the effect of decreasing the after-tax amount received by the U.S. Grantee as described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, then the U.S. Grantee shall have the right, in the U.S. Grantee’s sole discretion, to designate those rights, payments, or benefits under this Plan, any Other Agreements, and any Benefit Arrangements that should be reduced or eliminated so as to avoid having the payment or benefit to the U.S. Grantee under this Plan be deemed to be a Parachute Payment; provided, however, that in order to comply with Code Section 409A, the reduction or elimination will be performed in the order in which each dollar of value subject to an Award reduces the Parachute Payment to the greatest extent. 

^REQUIREMENTS OF LAW  

^^General  

The Company shall not be required to sell or issue any shares of Stock under any Award if the sale or issuance of such shares would constitute a violation by the Grantee, any other individual exercising an Option, or the Company of any provision of any law or regulation of any governmental authority, including without limitation any federal or state securities laws or regulations. If at any time the Company shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of any shares subject to an Award upon any securities exchange or under any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the issuance or purchase of shares hereunder, no shares of Stock may be issued or sold to the Grantee or any other individual exercising an Option pursuant to such Award unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company, and any delay caused thereby shall in no way affect the date of termination of the Award. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with the Securities Act, upon the exercise of any Option or any SAR that may be settled in shares of Stock or the delivery of any shares of Stock underlying an Award, unless a registration statement under such Act is in effect with respect to the shares of Stock covered by such Award, the Company shall not be required to sell or issue such shares unless the Board has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Grantee or any other individual exercising an Option may acquire such shares pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Any determination in this connection by the Board shall be final, binding, and conclusive. The Company may, but shall in no event be obligated to, register any securities covered hereby pursuant to the Securities Act. The Company shall not be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the exercise of an Option or a SAR or the issuance of shares of Stock pursuant to the Plan to comply with any 

^^^^^ 
law or regulation of any governmental authority. As to any jurisdiction that expressly imposes the requirement that an Option (or SAR that may be settled in shares of Stock) shall not be exercisable until the shares of Stock covered by such Option (or SAR) are registered or are exempt from registration, the exercise of such Option (or SAR) under circumstances in which the laws of such jurisdiction apply shall be deemed conditioned upon the effectiveness of such registration or the availability of such an exemption. 

^^Rule 16b-3  

During any time when the Company has a class of equity security registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that Awards pursuant to the Plan and the exercise of Options and SARs granted hereunder will qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. To the extent that any provision of the Plan or action by the Board does not comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed inoperative to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Board, and shall not affect the validity of the Plan. In the event that Rule 16b-3 is revised or replaced, the Board may exercise its discretion to modify this Plan in any respect necessary to satisfy the requirements of, or to take advantage of any features of, the revised exemption or its replacement. 

^EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION  
^^**Changes in Stock**

If the number of outstanding shares of Stock is increased or decreased or the shares of Stock are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company on account of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse split, combination of shares, exchange of shares, stock dividend or other distribution payable in capital stock, or other increase or decrease in such shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company occurring after the Effective Date, the number and kinds of shares for which grants of Options and other Awards may be made under the Plan, shall be adjusted proportionately and accordingly by the Company. In addition, the number and kind of shares for which Awards are outstanding shall be adjusted proportionately and accordingly so that the proportionate interest of the Grantee immediately following such event shall, to the extent practicable, be the same as immediately before such event. Any such adjustment in outstanding Options or SARs shall not change the aggregate Option Price or SAR Exercise Price payable with respect to shares that are subject to the unexercised portion of an outstanding Option or SAR, as applicable, but shall include a corresponding proportionate adjustment in the Option Price or SAR Exercise Price per share. The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as an increase in shares effected without receipt of consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any distribution to the Company’s stockholders of securities of any other entity or other assets (including an extraordinary dividend but excluding a non-extraordinary dividend of the Company) without receipt of consideration by the Company, the Company shall, in such manner as the Company deems appropriate, adjust (i) the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding Awards and/or (ii) the exercise price of outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights to reflect such distribution. 

^^**Reorganization in Which the Company Is the Surviving Entity Which does not Constitute a Corporate Transaction**

Subject to Section 17.3 hereof, if the Company shall be the surviving entity in any reorganization, merger, or consolidation of the Company with one or more other entities which does not constitute a Corporate Transaction, any Option or SAR theretofore granted pursuant to the Plan shall pertain to and apply to the securities to which a holder of the number of shares of Stock subject to such Option or SAR would have been entitled immediately following such reorganization, merger, or consolidation, with a corresponding proportionate adjustment of the Option Price or SAR Exercise Price per share so that the 

^^^^^ 
aggregate Option Price or SAR Exercise Price thereafter shall be the same as the aggregate Option Price or SAR Exercise Price of the shares remaining subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to such reorganization, merger, or consolidation. Subject to any contrary language in an Award Agreement evidencing an Award, any restrictions applicable to such Award shall apply as well to any replacement shares received by the Grantee as a result of the reorganization, merger or consolidation. In the event of a transaction described in this Section 17.2, Stock Units shall be adjusted so as to apply to the securities that a holder of the number of shares of Stock subject to the Stock Units would have been entitled to receive immediately following such transaction. 

^^Corporate Transaction in which Awards are not Assumed 

Upon the occurrence of a Corporate Transaction in which outstanding Options, SARs, Stock Units and Restricted Stock are not being assumed or continued**:** 

^^^all outstanding shares of Restricted Stock shall be deemed to have vested, and all Stock Units shall be deemed to have vested and the shares of Stock subject thereto shall be delivered, immediately prior to the occurrence of such Corporate Transaction, and 

^^^either of the following two actions shall be taken: 

^fifteen days prior to the scheduled consummation of a Corporate Transaction, all Options and SARs outstanding hereunder shall become immediately exercisable and shall remain exercisable for a period of fifteen days, or 

^the Board may elect, in its sole discretion, to cancel any outstanding Awards of Options, Restricted Stock, Stock Units, and/or SARs and pay or deliver, or cause to be paid or delivered, to the holder thereof an amount in cash or securities having a value (as determined by the Board acting in good faith), in the case of Restricted Stock or Stock Units, equal to the formula or fixed price per share paid to holders of shares of Stock and, in the case of Options or SARs, equal to the product of the number of shares of Stock subject to the Option or SAR (the “Award Shares”) multiplied by the amount, if any, by which (I) the formula or fixed price per share paid to holders of shares of Stock pursuant to such transaction exceeds (II) the Option Price or SAR Exercise Price applicable to such Award Shares. 

^^^Long-Term Incentive Awards shall be treated as though target performance has been achieved and will be paid in cash or converted into Unrestricted Stock. 

With respect to the Company’s establishment of an exercise window, (i) any exercise of an Option or SAR during such fifteen-day period shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the event and shall be effective only immediately before the consummation of the event, and (ii) upon consummation of any Corporate Transaction, the Plan and all outstanding but unexercised Options and SARs shall terminate. The Board shall send notice of an event that will result in such a termination to all individuals who hold Options and SARs not later than the time at which the Company gives notice thereof to its stockholders. 

^^Corporation Transaction in which Awards are Assumed 

The Plan, Options, SARs, Stock Units and Restricted Stock theretofore granted shall continue in the manner and under the terms so provided in the event of any Corporate Transaction to the extent that provision is made in writing in connection with such Corporate Transaction for the assumption or continuation of the Options, SARs, Stock Units and Restricted Stock theretofore granted, or for the substitution for such Options, SARs, Stock Units and Restricted Stock for new common stock options and stock appreciation rights and new common stock units and restricted stock relating to the stock of a 

^^^^^ 
successor entity, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number of shares (disregarding any consideration that is not common stock) and option and stock appreciation right exercise prices. In the event a Grantee’s Award is assumed, continued or substituted upon the consummation of any Corporate Transaction and his employment is terminated without Cause within one year following the consummation of such Corporate Transaction, the Grantee’s Award will be fully vested and may be exercised in full, to the extent applicable, beginning on the date of such termination and for the one-year period immediately following such termination or for such longer period as the Committee shall determine. 

^^Adjustments  

Adjustments under this Section 17 related to shares of Stock or securities of the Company shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. No fractional shares or other securities shall be issued pursuant to any such adjustment, and any fractions resulting from any such adjustment shall be eliminated in each case by rounding downward to the nearest whole share. The Board shall determine the effect of a Corporate Transaction upon Awards other than Options, SARs, Stock Units and Restricted Stock, and such effect shall be set forth in the appropriate Award Agreement. The Board may provide in the Award Agreements at the time of grant, or any time thereafter with the consent of the Grantee, for different provisions to apply to an Award in place of those described in **Sections 17.1, 17.2, 17.3** and 17.4. This Section 17.5 does not limit the Company’s ability to provide for alternative treatment of Awards outstanding under the Plan in the event of change of control events that are not Corporate Transactions. 

^^No Limitations on Company  

The making of Awards pursuant to the Plan shall not affect or limit in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, or liquidate, or to sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 

^GENERAL PROVISIONS  

^^Disclaimer of Rights  

No provision in the Plan or in any Award or Award Agreement shall be construed to confer upon any individual the right to remain in the employ or service of the Company or any Affiliate, or to interfere in any way with any contractual or other right or authority of the Company either to increase or decrease the compensation or other payments to any individual at any time, or to terminate any employment or other relationship between any individual and the Company. In addition, notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, unless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement, no Award granted under the Plan shall be affected by any change of duties or position of the Grantee, so long as such Grantee continues to be a director, officer, consultant or employee of the Company or an Affiliate. The obligation of the Company to pay any benefits pursuant to this Plan shall be interpreted as a contractual obligation to pay only those amounts described herein, in the manner and under the conditions prescribed herein. The Plan shall in no way be interpreted to require the Company to transfer any amounts to a third party trustee or otherwise hold any amounts in trust or escrow for payment to any Grantee or beneficiary under the terms of the Plan. 

^^Nonexclusivity of the Plan  

Neither the adoption of the Plan nor the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations upon the right and authority of the Board to adopt 

^^^^^ 
such other incentive compensation arrangements (which arrangements may be applicable either generally to a class or classes of individuals or specifically to a particular individual or particular individuals) as the Board in its discretion determines desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of stock options otherwise than under the Plan. 

^^Withholding Taxes  

No shares of Stock shall be delivered under the Plan to any Grantee until such Grantee has made arrangements acceptable to the Committee for the satisfaction of any income and employment tax withholding obligations under Applicable Laws. The Company or any Affiliate shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Grantee to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local or foreign taxes (including the Grantee’s payroll tax obligations) required or permitted by law to be withheld with respect to any taxable event concerning a Grantee arising as a result of this Plan. The Committee may in its discretion and in satisfaction of the foregoing requirement allow a Grantee to elect to have the Company withhold shares of Stock otherwise issuable under an Award or allow the return of shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the sums required to be withheld. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the number of shares which may be withheld with respect to the issuance, vesting, exercise or payment of any Award (or which may be repurchased from the Grantee of such Award after such shares of Stock were acquired by the Grantee from the Company) in order to satisfy the Grantee’s federal, state, local and foreign income and payroll tax liabilities with respect to the issuance, vesting, exercise or payment of the Award shall, unless specifically approved by the Committee, be limited to the number of shares of Stock which have a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or repurchase equal to the aggregate amount of such liabilities based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign income tax and payroll tax purposes that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income. 

^^Captions  

The use of captions in this Plan or any Award Agreement is for the convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning of any provision of the Plan or such Award Agreement. 

^^Other Provisions  

Each Award granted under the Plan may contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Board, in its sole discretion. 

^^Number and Gender  

With respect to words used in this Plan, the singular form shall include the plural form, the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender, etc., as the context requires. 

^^Severability  

If any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable by any court of law in any jurisdiction, the remaining provisions hereof and thereof shall be severable and enforceable in accordance with their terms, and all provisions shall remain enforceable in any other jurisdiction. 

^^^^^ 
^^Governing Law  

The validity and construction of this Plan and the instruments evidencing the Awards hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware, other than any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Plan and the instruments evidencing the Awards granted hereunder to the substantive laws of any other jurisdiction. 

^^Code Section 409A  

The Board intends to comply with Code Section 409A, or an exemption to Code Section 409A, with regard to Awards hereunder that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A. To the extent that the Board determines that a Grantee would be subject to the additional [[Percentage 3: Number]]% tax imposed on certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans pursuant to Code Section 409A as a result of any provision of any Award granted under this Plan, such provision shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to avoid application of such additional tax. The nature of any such amendment shall be determined by the Board. 

\centered * * * 

^^^^^ 
To record adoption of the Plan by the Board as of [[Date 1]], and approval of the Plan by the stockholders on [[Date 3: Date]], the Company has caused its authorized officer to execute the Plan.
