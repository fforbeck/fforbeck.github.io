Section 2.1 -  Grant of the Restricted Share Units 

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the additional terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company hereby grants Restricted Share Units (hereinafter called “RSUs”) to the Director, over a number of Shares as stated in Schedule A to this Agreement. 

Section 2.2 -  RSU Payment  

Subject to Section 5 of the Plan, the Shares to be issued upon vesting of the RSU must be fully paid up prior to vesting of the RSU by payment of the nominal value (US$[[USD Value 2]]115) per Share. The Committee shall ensure that payment of the nominal value for any Shares underlying the RSU is received by it on behalf of the Director prior to the vesting date from a non-Irish Subsidiary or other source and shall establish any procedures or protocols necessary to ensure that payment is timely received. 

Section 2.3 - -  Director’s Service  

The rights and obligations of the Director as a member of the Board of the Company shall not be affected by his participation in this Plan or right to participate in the Plan, and the Director hereby waives any and all rights to compensation or damages in consequence of his termination as a member of the Board for any reason whatsoever insofar as those rights arise or may arise from his ceasing to have rights under or be entitled to vest his RSUs following cessation of service. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, the Director shall be deemed irrevocably to have 

^^^^^ 
agreed not to pursue such claim and agrees to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claims. 

Section 2.4 -  Adjustments in RSUs Pursuant to Merger, Consolidation, etc. 

Subject to Sections 8 and 9 of the Plan, in the event that the outstanding Shares subject to RSUs are, from time to time, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of Shares or other securities, by reason of a share split, spin-off, shares or extraordinary cash dividend, share combination or reclassification, recapitalization or merger, Change of Control, or similar event, the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, make an appropriate and equitable adjustment in the number and kind of Shares. In the event of a Change of Control and regardless of whether the RSUs are assumed or substituted by a successor company, the RSUs shall not immediately vest unless the Committee so determines at the time of the Change of Control, in its absolute discretion, on such terms and conditions that the Committee deems appropriate. Any such adjustment or determination made by the Committee shall be final and binding upon the Director, the Company and all other interested persons. An adjustment may have the effect of reducing the price at which Shares may be acquired to less than their nominal value (the “Shortfall”), but only if and to the extent that the Committee shall be authorized to capitalize from the reserves of the Company a sum equal to the Shortfall and to apply that sum in paying up that amount on the Shares. 

Section 2.5 -  Director Costs  

The Director must make full payment to the Company by which the Director is providing service of all income tax, payroll tax, payment on account, and social insurance contribution amounts (“Tax”), which under federal, state, local or foreign law, the Company or any Subsidiary is required to withhold upon vesting or other tax event of the RSUs. In a case where the Company is obliged to (or would suffer a disadvantage if it were not to) account for any Tax (in any jurisdiction) for which the Director is liable by virtue of the Director’s participation in the Plan or any social insurance contributions legally applicable to the Director (the “Tax-Related Items”), the Director shall make full payment to the Company or any Subsidiary of an amount equal to the Tax-Related Items, or otherwise enter into arrangements acceptable to the Company or any Subsidiary to secure that such a payment is made (whether by withholding from cash compensation paid to the Director or from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired at vesting of the RSUs). 

In the event that the Director has not made payment of an amount equal to the Tax-Related Items liability, or entered into arrangements to secure that such a payment is made by the date of vesting or shortly thereafter as agreed by the Company, the Director hereby authorizes and empowers the Company to act on his behalf and procure and effect the sale of a sufficient number of the Shares arising from the RSUs to vest and pay out of the sale proceeds the Tax-Related Items liability to the Company or any Subsidiary. 

^^^^^ 
^\centered PERIOD OF VESTING 

Section 3.1 -  Commencement of Vesting  

^^Provided the Director continues as a member of the Board through the vesting date, the RSUs shall become vested as follows: 

\centered 

Percentage of Shares as to which Vesting Date    RSUs Become Vested [INSERT DATE]    [[Percentage 2: Number]]%  

^^In the event the Director ceases to be a member of the Board as a result of Death or Permanent Disability, the RSUs shall become fully vested with respect to all Ordinary Shares underlying such RSU Award at the time services end. 

^^The RSUs may immediately vest, if the Committee, in its sole discretion, so determines subject to Section 2.4 of the Agreement, upon the effective date of a Change of Control or other similar event. 

Section 3.2 -  Conditions to Issuance of Share Certificates 

The Shares to be delivered within one month of each vesting date of the RSUs, as set out in 3.1(a) above, may be either previously authorized but unissued shares or issued Shares held by any other person. Such Shares shall be fully paid. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificate or certificates (or their electronic equivalent) for Shares allotted and issued upon the applicable vesting date of the RSUs prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions: 

^^The obtaining of approval or other clearance from any state, federal, local or foreign governmental agency which the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; and 

^^The Director has paid or made arrangements to pay the Tax-Related Items Liability in accordance with Section 2.5. 

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may in the case of U.S. resident directors of the Company require an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to it to the effect that any subsequent transfer of Shares acquired on the vesting of RSUs does not violate the Exchange Act and may issue stop-transfer orders in the U.S. covering such Shares. 

^^^^^ 
^-  Rights as Shareholder  

The Director shall not be, nor have any of the rights or privileges of, a shareholder of the Company in respect of any Shares that may be received upon the vesting of the RSUs unless and until certificates representing such Shares (or their electronic equivalent) shall have been issued by the Company to the Director. No dividend equivalent payments shall be made on the RSUs. 

Section 3.4 -  Limitation on Obligations  

The Company’s obligation with respect to the RSUs granted hereunder is limited solely to the delivery to the Director of Shares within the period when such Shares are due to be delivered hereunder, and in no way shall the Company become obligated to pay cash in respect of such obligation. This RSU Award shall not be secured by any specific assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor shall any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be designated as attributable or allocated to the satisfaction of the Company’s obligations under this Agreement. In addition, the Company shall not be liable to the Director for damages relating to any delays in issuing the share certificates or its electronic equivalent to him (or his designated entities), any loss of the certificates, or any mistakes or errors in the issuance of the certificates or in the certificates themselves. 

^\centered ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE RSUs 

Section 4.1 -  Nature of Award  

In accepting the RSUs, the Director acknowledges, understands and agrees that: 

^^the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature and may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time; 

^^the RSU award is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future RSU awards, or benefits in lieu of a RSU award, even if RSU awards have been granted repeatedly in the past; 

^^all decisions with respect to future RSUs, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; 

^^the Director’s participation in the Plan is voluntary; 

^^the RSUs and any Shares acquired under the Plan are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation under any pension arrangement; 

^^the RSUs and any Shares acquired under the Plan are not part of normal or expected compensation for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, dismissal, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be 

^^^^^ 
considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to past services to the Company or any Subsidiary; and 

^^the future value of the Shares underlying the RSUs is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. 

Section 4.2 -  No Advice Regarding Grant  

The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Director’s participation in the Plan, the issuance of Shares upon vesting of the RSUs or sale of the Shares. The Director is hereby advised to consult with his own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding his participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan. 

Section 4.3 -  Director Reporting Obligation 

Directors of the Company are subject to certain notification requirements under the Act. Directors must notify the company for which the Director is providing service of the Director’s interest in the Company and the number and class of Shares or rights to which the interest relates within five days of the issuance or disposal of Shares or within five days of becoming aware of the event giving rise to the notification by submitting a Form 53.

***Notifications***  
This Schedule B also includes information based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the Director’s country as of [[Date 1: Date]]. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Director not rely on the information noted herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of the Director’s participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time the RSUs vest under the Plan. 

In addition, the information is general in nature. The Company is not providing the Director with any tax advice with respect to the RSUs. The information is provided below may not apply to the Director’s particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure the Director of any particular result. *Accordingly, the Director is strongly advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the tax or other laws in the Director’s country apply to the Director’s situation.*

Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Company is obliged to (or would suffer a disadvantage if it were not to) account for any income tax or National Insurance Contributions (“NICs”) for which the Director is liable by virtue of the Director’s participation in the Plan, the Director shall make full payment to the Company or any Subsidiary of an amount equal to the Tax-Related Items, or otherwise enter into arrangements acceptable to the Company or any Subsidiary to secure that such a payment by any method set forth in Section 2.5 of the Agreement within 90 days after the Taxable Event although the Director acknowledges that he ultimately will be responsible for reporting any income tax or NICs due on the RSU income directly to the HMRC under the self-assessment regime.
