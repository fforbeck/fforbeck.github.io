\centered **WAIVER AGREEMENT**

**THIS WAIVER AGREEMENT** is made as of [[Date 1: Date]] by and among [[NEXX]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (“NEXX”) with a principal address of 900 Middlesex Turnpike, Building #6, [[Principal Stockholders]] (each a “Principal Stockholder” and collectively the “Principal Stockholders”) with the addresses set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto.

\centered RECITAL

NEXX desires to conduct an initial public offering (the “IPO”) during 2010 and has entered into a term sheet with Canaccord Adams, Inc. to serve as a lead underwriter of the IPO. The cost, time and efforts to be expended in the IPO are substantial. Currently, NEXX’s Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”) provides that shares of NEXX’s Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock (collectively, the Preferred Stock”) automatically convert to NEXX Common Stock provided that certain conditions are met, including NEXX raising a certain minimum amount of funds in the public offering. NEXX’s Board of Directors seeks to avoid a situation where NEXX may undertake a ll of the cost, time and expenses to effect the IPO but the IPO fails to meet the funding criteria set forth in the Charter. NEXX’s Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interest of all of NEXX’s stockholders that NEXX obtain a waiver from the holders of Preferred Stock allowing the IPO to proceed if approved by the terms of the IPO are approved by the holders of a majority of the Board of Directors, regardless of the sums raised in the financing. NEXX’s Principal Stockholders have agreed to waive their rights under the Charter as regards these minimum threshold requirements. As consideration for this waiver, certain of these Principal Stockholders have requested that NEXX modify other provisions in the Charter and other agreements in effect as consideration for the waiver. NEXX’s Board of Directors retained a highly qualified independent third party appraisal firm, SVB Analytics, to determine appropriate compensatio n for the waiver. After review of a report by SVB Analytics, the Board of Directors negotiated more favorable terms for NEXX than suggested by SVB Analytics, consisting of an increase to the Common Stock equivalents issuable for NEXX’s preferred stock 

upon the effectiveness of the IPO. The Charter provides that any term of the Charter and certain other agreements between NEXX and the holders of its Preferred Stock may be modified provided that the modification is approved by the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock. The Principal Stockholders executing this Waiver Agreement constitute a majority of the holders of each series of NEXX’s Preferred Stock.

For good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt whereof are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

^**Modification of Charter and Related Investment Agreements**. (a) The parties hereby agree to amend, effective immediately subclause (i) of Section 5(i) of Article Fourth of NEXX s Charter to read as follows: “(i) the closing of an underwritten, firm commitment public offering of shares of the capital stock of the Corporation pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or…”

^^The Parties hereby amend (i) the Investor Rights Agreement dated as of [[Date 2: Date]] by and among NEXX and the Investors named therein, (ii) the Right of First Refusal and Co-Sale Agreement dated as of [[Date 2]] between NEXX, the Investors and the Key Holders named therein, and (iii) the Voting Rights Agreement by and among NEXX, the Investors and the Key Holders named therein to provide that a “Qualified IPO” shall consist of “any initial public offering on any stock exchange approved by a majority of the Board of Directors”

^**Modification of Conversion Shares.** As consideration for the waiver granted in Section 1 above, immediately prior to the effectiveness of the IPO, NEXX shall increase the following number of Common Stock share equivalents for each series of Preferred Stock as set forth below and such additional common share equivalents shall be allocated pro rata among the then outstanding shares of each series of the Preferred Stock as set forth below:

\centered **Series of Preferred Stock**   \centered **Additional Common Share Equivalents** Series A Preferred Stock   \centered 793,176 Series B Preferred Stock and Warrant   \centered 7,270,864 Series C Preferred Stock   \centered 7,063,923 Series D Preferred Stock and Warrants   \centered 14,872,037 TOTAL   

\centered 30,000,000  

^**Further Adjustment to Conversion Shares**. The Conversion Shares, as set forth in Section 2, shall be subject to further adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Charter, as then in effect, for future stock splits and reorganizations. The Principal Stockholders agree that the issuance of the Conversion Shares, and any shares of NEXX’s Common Stock issuable by means of this Waiver, shall not be deemed to constitute “Additional Stock” as defined in Section 5 of Article Fourth of the Charter. All of the Conversion Shares shall be subject to any reverse stock split effected immediately prior to the effectiveness of t he IPO.

^**Further Actions.** Each of the Parties agrees to take all actions necessary to carry out the actions contemplated by this Waiver. If for any reason the IPO is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission but the IPO closing is not consummated, then the modification of the Conversion Rates for the Preferred Stock shall be cancelled.

^**Tax Liability of the Principal Stockholders and Payment of Taxes**. The Principal Stockholders acknowledge and agree that any income or other taxes (if any) due from the Principal Stockholders with respect to the Waiver, shall be the Principal Stockholders’ responsibility.

^**Equitable Relief**. The Principal Stockholders specifically acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement, monetary damages may not be adequate to compensate NEXX, and, therefore, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any right to damages, NEXX shall be entitled to equitable relief in any court having competent jurisdiction. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting NEXX from pursuing any other remedies available to it for any such breach or threatened breach.

No such waiver or consent shall be deemed to be or shall constitute a waiver or consent with respect to any other terms or provisions of this Agreement, whether or not similar. Each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which it was given, and shall not constitute a continuing waiver or consent.

^**Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

^**Opportunity to Obtain Independent Advice**.
