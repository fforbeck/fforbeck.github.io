^**LOAN AND TERMS OF PAYMENT**  
^^**Promise to Pay**. Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay Bank the unpaid principal amount of all Advances hereunder with all interest, fees and finance charges due thereon as and when due in accordance with this Exim Agreement.

2.1.1 **Financing of Accounts**.  
^^**Availability**.   
^^^Subject to the terms of this Exim Agreement and to the deduction of Reserves, and provided that Borrower is not Streamline Facility Eligible, Borrower may request that Bank finance specific Eligible Foreign Accounts. Bank may, in its good faith business discretion, finance such Eligible Foreign Accounts by extending credit to Borrower in an amount equal to the result of the Advance Rate multiplied by the face amount of the Eligible Foreign Account. Bank may, in its sole discretion, change the percentage of the Advance Rate for a particular Eligible Foreign Account on a case by case basis.

^^^Subject to the terms of this Exim Agreement and to the deduction of Reserves, after the occurrence of the Sale Event, and provided that Borrower is Streamline Facility Eligible, Borrower may request that Bank finance Eligible Foreign Accounts on an aggregate basis (the “Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts”). Bank may, in its good faith business discretion, finance Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts by extending credit to Borrower in an amount equal to the result of the Advance Rate multiplied by the face amount of the Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts. Bank may, in its sole discretion, change the percentage of the Advance Rate for the Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts on a case by case basis.

^^^Subject to the terms of this Exim Agreement and to the deduction of Reserves, Borrower may request that Bank finance Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoices. Bank may, in its good faith business discretion, finance such Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoices by extending credit to Borrower in an amount equal to the result of the Advance Rate multiplied by the face amount of the Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoice. Bank may, in its sole discretion, change the percentage of the Advance Rate for a particular Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoice on a case by case basis.

^^^Any extension of credit made pursuant to the terms of subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above shall be hereinafter referred to as an “Advance”. Any Advance made based upon an Eligible Foreign Account shall be hereinafter referred to as an “Eligible Foreign Account Advance”. Any Advance made based upon an Aggregate Eligible Foreign Account shall be hereinafter referred to as an “Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts Advance”. Any Advance made based upon an Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoice shall be hereinafter referred to as an “Exim Inventory Advance”. When Bank makes an Advance, the Eligible Foreign Account, Aggregate Eligible For eign Accounts or Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoice each become a separate “Financed Receivable”.

^^**Maximum Advances; Maximum Exim Inventory Advances**.

^^^**Maximum Advances**. The aggregate face amount of all Financed Receivables outstanding at any time may not exceed the Facility Amount. In addition and notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) prior to the occurrence of the Sale Event, the aggregate amount of Advances outstanding hereunder together with all Advances (as defined in the Domestic Agreement) outstanding under the Domestic Agreement may not exceed Five Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]) at any time, and (B) the aggregate amount of Advances outstanding hereunder at any time may not exceed Five Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 1]]).

^^^**Maximum Exim Inventory Advances**. Notwithstanding any terms in this Exim Agreement to the contrary, the aggregate principal amount of Exim Inventory Advances outstanding hereunder shall not exceed the lesser of (A) Three Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]), and (B) sixty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the aggregate principal amount of all Advances outstanding hereunder at any time. If, at any time, the aggregate amount of Exim Inventory Advances outstanding at any time exceed the maximum amounts set forth in this provision, Borrower shall immediately pay to Bank the excess and, in connection with same, hereby irrevocably authorizes Bank to debit any account of Borrower maintained by Borrower with Bank or any of Bank’s Affiliates for the amount of such excess.

^^**Borrowing Procedure**. Borrower will deliver an Advance Request and Invoice Transmittal in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit E** signed by a Responsible Officer and an Export Order for each

Advance it requests, accompanied by an accounts receivable aging, with respect to Advances based upon Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts, or by invoices (and any other documentation related thereto as requested by Bank), with respect to Advances based upon Eligible Foreign Accounts and Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoices. Bank may rely on information set forth in or provided with the Advance Request and Invoice Transmittal and Export Order.

^^**Credit Quality; Confirmations**. Bank may, at its option, conduct a credit check of the Account Debtor for each Account requested by Borrower for financing hereunder in order to approve any such Account Debtor’s credit before agreeing to finance such Account. Bank may also verify directly with the respective Account Debtors the validity, amount and other matters relating to the Accounts (including confirmations of Borrower’s representations in Section 5.3 and Section 5.4) by means of mail, telephone or otherwise, either in the name of Borrower or Bank from time to time in its sole discretion.

^^**Accounts Notification/Collection**. Bank may notify any Person owing Borrower money of Bank’s security interest in the funds and verify and/or collect the amount of the Account; provided, however, while Borrower is Streamline Facility Eligible, Bank will provide notice to Borrower of any such verification and/or collection.

^^**Early Termination**. This Exim Agreement may be terminated prior to the Maturity Date as follows: (i) by Borrower, effective three Business Days after written notice of termination is given to Bank; or (ii) by Bank at any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default, without notice, effective immediately. If this Exim Agreement is terminated (A) by Bank in accordance with clause (ii) in the foregoing sentence, or (B) by Borrower for any reason, and at the time of such termination the Domestic Agreement has been terminated or matured, Borrower shall pay to Bank a termination fee in an amount equal to Eighty Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 3: Number]] .00) (the “Early Termination Fee”). The Early Termination Fee shall be due and payable on the effective date of such termination and thereafter shall bear interest at a rate equal to the highest rate applicable to any of the Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bank agrees to waive the Early Termination Fee if Bank agrees to refinance and redocument this Exim Agreement under another division of Bank (in its sole and exclusive discretion) prior to the Maturity Date.

^^**Maturity**. This Exim Agreement shall terminate and all Obligations outstanding hereunder shall be immediately due and payable on the Maturity Date.

^^**Suspension of Advances**. Borrower’s ability to request that Bank finance Eligible Foreign Accounts, Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts and Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoices hereunder will terminate if, in Bank’s sole discretion, there has been a material adverse change in the general affairs, management, results of operation, condition (financial or otherwise) or the prospect of repayment of the Obligations, or there has been any material adverse deviation by Borrower from the most recent business plan of Borrower presented to and accepted by Bank prior to the execution of this Exim Agreement.

^^**End of Streamline Facility Eligible Status**. On any day that Borrower ceases to be Streamline Facility Eligible, all outstanding Advances made based on Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts shall be immediately due and payable, together with all Finance Charges accrued thereon. Provided no Event of Default then exists hereunder and subject to the terms of this Exim Agreement, Bank may, in its good faith business discretion, agree to refinance the outstanding principal amount of such Advances with new Advances made based on specific Eligible Foreign Accounts (in accordance with this Exim Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 2.1.1 hereof). In connection with same, Borrower shall deliver to Bank an Advance Request and Invoice Transmittal in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit E** and an Export Order containing detailed invoice reporting, signed by a Responsible Officer, together with a current accounts receivable aging and a copy of each invoice, all in accordance with Section 6.4(d) hereof and Bank, in its good faith business discretion, may finance same (in accordance with this Exim Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 2.1.1 hereof) and each Eligible Foreign Account financed shall thereafter be deemed to be a Financed Receivable for purposes of this Exim Agreement. If, following such determination, the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations exceeds the amount of Advances Bank has agreed to make based on specific Eligible Foreign Accounts, Borrower shall immediately pay to Bank the excess and, in connection with same, hereb y irrevocably authorizes Bank to debit any account of Borrower maintained by Borrower with Bank or any of Bank’s Affiliates for the amount of such excess.

^^**Commencement of Streamline Facility Eligible Status**. On any day that Borrower becomes Streamline Facility Eligible, Borrower may request that Bank refinance the principal amount of all outstanding Advances made based upon Eligible Foreign Accounts as Advances made based upon Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts. In connection with such request, Borrower shall deliver to Bank an Advance Request and Invoice Transmittal in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit E** containing a current accounts receivable aging and Bank may, in its good faith business discretion, agree to finance same (in accordance with this Exim Agreement, i ncluding, without limitation, Section 2.1.1 hereof) and the Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts financed shall thereafter be deemed to be a Financed Receivable for purposes of this Exim Agreement. At the time of such refinancing, all accrued Financed Charges and Collateral Handling Fees accrued on the refinanced Advances shall be immediately due and payable. If, following such determination, the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations exceeds the amount of Advances Bank has agreed to make based upon Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts, Borrower shall immediately pay to Bank the excess and, in connection with same, hereby irrevocably authorizes Bank to debit any account of Borrower maintained by Borrower with Bank for the amount of such excess.

2.1.2 **Note**. To evidence the Advances, Borrower shall execute and deliver to Bank on the date hereof a promissory note (the “Exim Note”) in substantially the form attached hereto as **Exhibit C**.

^^**Collections, Finance Charges, Remittances and Fees**. The Obligations shall be subject to the following fees and Finance Charges. Unpaid fees and Finance Charges may, in Bank’s discretion, accrue interest and fees as described in Section 9.2 hereof.

2.2.1 **Collections**. Collections will be credited to the Financed Receivable Balance for such Financed Receivable, but if there is an Event of Default, Bank may apply Collections to the Obligations in any order it chooses. If Bank receives a payment for both a Financed Receivable and a non-Financed Receivable, the funds will first be applied to the Financed Receivable and, if there is no Event of Default then existing, the excess will be remitted to Borrower, subject to Section 2.2.6.

2.2.2 **Finance Charges**. In computing Finance Charges on the Obligations under this Exim Agreement, all Collections received by Bank shall be deemed applied by Bank on account of the Obligations three (3) Business Days after receipt of the Collections. Borrower will pay a finance charge (the “Finance Charge”) on the Financed Receivable Balance which is equal to the Applicable Rate **divided by** 360 **multiplied by** the number of days each such Financed Receivable is outstanding **multiplied by** (a) with respect to Financed Receivables based on Eligible Foreign Accounts and Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoices, the outstanding Financed Receivable Balance, and (b) with respect to Financed Receivables based on Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts, the outstanding Streamline Account Balance. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.1.1(i), Section 2.1.1(j) and Section 2.3.1(b)(i), the Finance Charge is payable when the Advance made based on such Financed Receivable is payable in accordance with Section 2.3 hereof. After an Event of Default, the Applicable Rate will increase an additional five percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) per annum effective immediately upon the occurrence of such Event of Default. In the event that the aggregate amount of Finance Charges earned by Bank in any Reconciliation Period during which Borrower is not Streamline Facility Eligible under this Exim Agreement and the Domestic Agreement is less than the Minimum Finance Charge, Borrower shall pay to Bank an additional Finance Charge equal to ( i) the Minimum Finance Charge minus (ii) the aggregate amount of all Finance Charges earned by Bank under this Exim Agreement and the Domestic Agreement in such Reconciliation Period. Such additional Finance Charge shall be payable on the first day of the next Reconciliation Period.

2.2.3 **Collateral Handling Fee**. With respect to Financed Receivables based upon Eligible Foreign Accounts and Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoices, when Borrower is not Streamline Facility Eligible, Borrower will pay to Bank a collateral handling fee equal to [[Percentage 3: Number]]% per month of the Financed Receivable Balance for each such Financed Receivable outstanding based upon a 360 day year (the “Collateral Handling Fee”). This fee is charged on a daily basis which is equal to the Collateral Handling Fee divided by 30, multiplied by the number of days each such Financed Receivable is outstanding, multiplied by the outstanding Financed Receivable Balance. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.1.1(j), the Collate ral Handling Fee is payable when the Advance made based on such Financed Receivable is payable in accordance with Section 2.3 hereof. In computing Collateral Handling Fees under this Exim Agreement, all Collections received by Bank shall be deemed applied by Bank on account of Obligations three (3) Business Days after receipt of the Collections. After an Event of Default, the Collateral Handling Fee will increase an additional [[Percentage 4: Number]]% effective immediately upon such Event of Default.

2.2.4 **Accounting**. After each Reconciliation Period, Bank will provide an accounting of the transactions for that Reconciliation Period, including the amount of all Financed Receivables, all Collections, Adjustments, Finance Charges, Collateral Handling Fees and the Facility Fee. If Borrower does not object to the accounting in writing within thirty (30) days it shall be considered accurate. All Finance Charges and other interest and fees are calculated on the basis of a 360 day year and actual days elapsed.

2.2.5 **Deductions**. Bank may deduct fees, Finance Charges, Advances which become due pursuant to Section 2.3, and other amounts due pursuant to this Exim Agreement from any Advances made or Collections received by Bank.

2.2.6 **Lockbox; Account Collection Services**.

^^Borrower shall direct each Account Debtor (and each depository institution where proceeds of Accounts are on deposit) to remit payments with respect to the Accounts to a lockbox account established with Bank or to wire transfer payments to a cash collateral account that Bank controls (collectively, the “Lockbox”). It will be considered an immediate Event of Default if the Lockbox is not set-up and operational on the Effective Date.

^^For any time at which such Lockbox is not established, the proceeds of the Accounts shall be paid by the Account Debtors to an address consented to by Bank. Upon receipt by Borrower of such proceeds, Borrower shall immediately transfer and deliver same to Bank, along with a detailed cash receipts journal. Provided no Event of Default exists or an event that with notice or lapse of time will be an Event of Default, within three (3) days of receipt of such amounts by Bank, Bank will turn over to Borrower the proceeds of the Accounts other than Collections with respect to Financed Receivables and the amount of Collections in excess of the amounts for which Bank has made an Advance to Borrower, less any amounts due to Bank, such as the Finance Charg e, the Facility Fee, payments due to Bank, other fees and expenses, or otherwise; provided, however, Bank may hold such excess amount with respect to Financed Receivables as a reserve until the end of the applicable Reconciliation Period if Bank, in its discretion, determines that other Financed Receivable(s) may no longer qualify as an Eligible Foreign Account, Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts, or an Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoice at any time prior to the end of the subject Reconciliation Period. This Section 2.2.6 does not impose any affirmative duty on Bank to perform any act other than as specifically set forth herein. All Accounts and the proceeds thereof are Collateral and if an Event of Default occurs, Bank may apply the proceeds of such Accounts to the Obligations.

2.2.7 **Bank Expenses**. Borrower shall pay all Bank Expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, plus expenses, for documentation and negotiation of this Exim Agreement) incurred through and after the Effective Date, when due.

^^**Repayment of Obligations; Adjustments.**

^^^In addition to the foregoing, Borrower hereby authorizes Bank to, up to one (1) time per Reconciliation Period, refinance all outstanding Advances which are made based upon Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts.

^^Borrower will repay each Exim Inventory Advance on the earliest of: (i) the date on which payment is received of the Financed Receivable with respect to which the Exim Inventory Advance was made, (ii) Borrower’s issuance of an invoice in respect of any purchase order in respect of an Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoice, (iii) the date on which there is a breach of any warranty or representation set forth in Section 5.4, or a breach of any covenant in this Exim Agreement, (iv) the date on which the Inventory subject to an Exim Inventory Advance is sold by Borrower, (v) the date on which the full amount of the Advances must be repaid pursuant to Section 2.5, or (vi) the Maturity Date (including any early termination). Each payment will also include all accrued Finance Charges and Collateral Handling Fees with respect to each Exim Inventory Advance and all other amounts then due and payable hereunder.

The demand may, at Bank’s option, include the Advance for each Financed Receivable then outstanding and all accrued Finance Charges, Collateral Handling Fees, attorneys’ and professional fees, court costs and expenses, and any other Obligations.

2.3.3 **Debit of Accounts**. Bank may debit any of Borrower’s deposit accounts for payments or any amounts Borrower owes Bank hereunder. Bank shall promptly notify Borrower when it debits Borrower’s accounts. These debits shall not constitute a set-off.

2.3.4 **Adjustments**. If, at any time during the term of this Exim Agreement, any Account Debtor asserts an Adjustment, Borrower issues a credit memorandum, or any of the representations and warranties in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 or covenants in this Exim Agreement are no longer true in all material respects, Borrower will promptly advise Bank.

^^**Power of Attorney**. Borrower irrevocably appoints Bank and its successors and assigns as attorney-in-fact and authorizes Bank, to: (a) following the occurrence of an Event of Default, (i) sell, assign, transfer, pledge, compromise, or discharge all or any part of the Financed Receivables; (ii) demand, collect, sue, and give releases to any Account Debtor for monies due and compromise, prosecute, or defend any action, claim, case or proceeding about the Financed Receivables, including filing a claim or voting a claim in any bankruptcy case in Bank’s or Borrower’s name, as Bank chooses; and (iii) prepare, file and sign Borrower’s name on any notice, claim, assignment, demand, draft, or notice o f or satisfaction of lien or mechanics’ lien or similar document; and

^^**Exim Guaranty**. To facilitate the financing of Eligible Foreign Accounts, Aggregate Eligible Foreign Accounts and Exim Inventory Placeholder Invoices, the Exim Bank has agreed to guarantee the Exim Loans made under this Exim Agreement, pursuant to a Master Guarantee Agreement, Loan Authorization Agreement and (to the extent applicable) Delegated Authority Letter Agreement (collectively, the “Exim Guaranty”). If, at any time after the Exim Guaranty has been entered into by Bank, (a) the Exim Guaranty shall cease to be in full force and effect, or (b) if the Exim Bank declares the Exim Guaranty void or revokes any obligations thereunder or denies liability thereunder, Borrower shall immediately repay all outstanding Advances hereunder, and Borrower shall cash collateralize all issued and undrawn letters of credit issued by Bank, if any.

When the Borrower Agreement is entered into by Borrower and the Exim Bank and delivered to Bank, this Exim Agreement shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Borrower Agreement, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by this re ference. From and after the time Borrower and the Exim Bank have entered into the Borrower Agreement and delivered the same to Bank, Borrower expressly agrees to perform all of the obligations and comply with all of the affirmative and negative covenants and all other terms and conditions set forth in the Borrower Agreement as though the same were expressly set forth herein.

^**CHOICE OF LAW, VENUE AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER**

Massachusetts law governs the Loan Documents without regard to principles of conflicts of law. Borrower and Bank each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in Massachusetts; provided, however, that if for any reason Bank cannot avail itself of such courts in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Borrower accepts jurisdiction of the courts and venue in [[Address 4: Address]], California. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Exim Agreement shall be deemed to operate to preclude Bank from bringing suit or taking other legal action in any other jurisdiction to realize on the Collateral or any other security for the Obligations, or to enforce a judgment or other court order in favor of Bank. Borrower expressly submits and consents in advance to such jurisdiction in any acti on or suit commenced in any such court, and Borrower hereby waives any objection that it may have based upon lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, or forum non conveniens and hereby consents to the granting of such legal or equitable relief as is deemed appropriate by such court. Borrower hereby waives personal service of the summons, complaints, and other process issued in such action or suit and agrees that service of such summons, complaints, and other process may be made by registered or certified mail addressed to Borrower at the address set forth in the preamble of this Exim Agreement and that service so made shall be deemed completed upon the earlier to occur of Borrower’s actual receipt thereof or three (3) days after deposit in the U.S. mails, proper postage prepaid.

At any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, without demand or notice, Bank may set off the same or any part thereof and apply the same to any liability or obligation of Borrower even though unmatured and regardless of the adequacy of any other collatera l securing the Obligations. ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE BANK TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER COLLATERAL WHICH SECURES THE OBLIGATIONS, PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS OR OTHER PROPERTY OF BORROWER, ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVED.

All covenants, representations and warranties made in this Exim Agreement continue in full force until this Exim Agreement has terminated pursuant to its terms and all Obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations and any other obligations which, by their terms, are to survive the termination of this Exim Agreement) have been satisfied. The obligation of Borrower in Section 12.2 to indemnify Bank shall survive until the statute of limitations with respect to such claim or cause of action shall have run.

^^**Confidentiality**. In handling any confidential information, Bank shall exercise the same degree of care that it exercises for its own proprietary information, but disclosure of information may be made: (a) to Bank’s Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (b) to prospective transferees or purchasers of any interest in the Advances (provided, however, Bank shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such prospective transferee’s or purchaser’s agreement to the terms of this provision); (c) as required by law, regulation, subpoena, or other order; (d) to Bank’s regulators or as otherwise required in connection with Bank’s examination or audit; ( e) as Bank considers appropriate in exercising remedies under the Loan Documents; and (f) to third-party service providers of Bank so long as such service providers have executed a confidentiality agreement with Bank with terms no less restrictive than those contained herein.

The term “Obligations” as used in this Exim Agreement and in the Borrower Agreement shall include without limitation the obligation to pay when due all loans made pursuant to the Borrower Agreement (the “Exim Loans”) and all interest thereon and the obligation to pay when due all Advances made pursuant to the terms of this Exim Agreement and all interest thereon. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the security interest g ranted herein covering all “Collateral” as defined in this Exim Agreement and as defined in the Borrower Agreement shall secure all Exim Loans and all Advances and all interest thereon, and all other Obligations. Any Event of Default under this Exim Agreement shall also constitute an Event of Default under the Borrower Agreement, and any Event of Default under the Borrower Agreement shall also constitute an Event of Default under this Exim Agreement. In the event Bank assigns its rights under this Exim Agreement and/or under any note evidencing Exim Loans and/or its rights under the Borrower Agreement and/or under any note evidencing Advances, to any third party, including, without limitation, the Exim Bank, whether before or after the occurrence of any Event of Default, Bank shall have the right (but not any obligation), in its sole discretion, to allocate and apportion Collateral to the Borrower Agreement and/or note assigned and to specify the priorities of the respective security interests in such Collateral between itself and the assignee, all without notice to or consent of the Borrower.
