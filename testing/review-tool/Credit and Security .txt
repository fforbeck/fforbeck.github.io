During such suspension, new Loans, outstanding Prime Loans, and LIBOR Loans whose Interest Periods terminate may only be Prime Loans.

^^**Optional Prepayments.** Subject to the provisions of Section 2.6, Borrower will have the right to prepay, without premium or penalty, all or any portion of the Loans; provided, that on each prepayment, Borrower will pay the accrued interest on the prepaid principal, to the date of such prepayment.

^^**Default Interest Rate.** From and after written notice by CNB to Borrower of the occurrence of an Event of Default (and without constituting a waiver of such Event of Default), the Loans and any other amounts due CNB hereunder (and interest to the extent permitted by law) will bear additional interest at a fluctuating rate equal to three percent ([[Percentage 5]]%) per year higher than the interest rate as determined in Sections 2.1.1, until the Event of Default has been cured; provided, however, with respect to any Overadvance for which additional interest is then being charged under Section 2.1.2, such additional interest shall be deducted from any default interest charged on the Overadvance under this Section, and provided, further, for purposes of this Section, a LIBOR Loan will be treated as a Prime Loan upon the termination of the Interest Period. All interest provided for in this Section will be compounded monthly and payable on demand.

^^**Payments**. All payments will be in United States Dollars and in immediately available funds. Interest will accrue daily and will be computed (a) in the case of LIBOR Loans, on the basis of a 360-day year, and (b) in the case of Prime Loans, on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed. All payments of principal, interest, fees and other charges incurred under this Agreement will be made by charging, and Borrower hereby authorizes CNB to charge, Borrower’s Demand Deposit Account or Borrower’s Loan Account. All loan disbursements made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made by direct deposit to Borrower’s Demand Deposit Account. ..

^^**Funding Losses**. If Borrower shall (a) repay, prepay or convert any LIBOR Loans on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans, (b) fail to borrow any Loans in accordance with a request therefor delivered to CNB (whether as a result of the failure to satisfy any applicable conditions or otherwise), or (c) fail to make any prepayment in accordance with any notice of prepayment delivered to the Administrative Agent, then the Borrower shall, within 10 days of demand by CNB and presentation by CNB of a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the amount of costs and losses incurred by CNB for which demand is made (which certificate shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount of such loss for purposes of this Agreement), reimburse CNB for all out-of-pocket costs and losses incurred by CNB as a result of such repayment, prepayment or failure (“Liquidation Costs”).

10.2.1 **Mandatory Arbitration.** At the request of CNB or Borrower, any dispute, claim or controversy of any kind (whether in contract or tort, statutory or common law, legal or equitable) now existing or hereafter arising between CNB and Borrower and in any way arising out of, pertaining to or in connection with: (1) this Agreement, and/or any renewals, extensions, or amendments thereto; (2) any of the Loan Documents; (3) any violation of this Agreement or the Loan Documents; (4) all past, present and future loans; (5) any incidents, omissions, acts, practices or occurrences arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Loan Documents causing injury to either party whereby the other party or its agents, employees or representatives may be liable, in whole or in part, or (6) any aspect of the present or future relationships of the parties, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration conducted at a location determined by the arbitrator in [[Address 3: Address]], California, and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the California Arbitration Act (Title 9, California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1280 et. seq.) and the then existing Commercial Rules of the AAA. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof.

10.2.2 **Real Property Collateral.** Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.2.1, no controversy or claim will be submitted to arbitration without the consent of all the parties if, at the time of the proposed submission, such controversy or claim arises from or relates to an obligation owed to CNB which is secured in whole or in part by real property collateral. If all parties do not consent to submission of such a controversy or claim to arbitration, the controversy or claim will be determined as provided in Section 10.2.3.

10.2.3 **Judicial Reference.** At the request of any party, a controversy or claim which is not submitted to arbitration as provided and limited in Sections 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 will be determined by a reference in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 638 et. seq. If such an election is made, the parties will designate to the court a referee or referees selected under the auspices of the AAA in the same manner as arbitrators are selected in AAA-sponsored proceedings. The presiding referee of the panel, or the referee if there is a single referee, will be an active attorney or retired judge. Judgment upon the award rendered by such referee or referees will be entered in the court in which such proceeding was commenced in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 644 and 645.

10.2.4 **Provisional Remedies, Self Help and Foreclosure.** No provision of this Agreement will limit the right of any party to: (1) foreclose against any real property collateral by the exercise of a power of sale under a deed of trust, mortgage or other security agreement or instrument, or applicable law, (2) exercise any rights or remedies as a secured party against any personal property collateral pursuant to the terms of a security agreement or pledge agreement, or applicable law, (3) exercise self help remedies such as setoff, or (4) obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as injunctive relief or the appointment of a receiver from a court having jurisdiction before, during or after the pendency of any arbitration or referral. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of provisional or ancillary remedies, or exercise of self help remedies will not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to submit any dispute to arbitration or judicial reference.

10.2.5 **Powers and Qualifications of Arbitrators.** The arbitrator(s) will give effect to statutes of limitation, waiver and estoppel and other affirmative defenses in determining any claim. Any controversy concerning whether an issue is arbitratable will be determined by the arbitrator(s). The laws of the State of California will govern. The arbitration award may include equitable and declaratory relief. All arbitrator(s) selected will be required to be a practicing attorney or retired judge licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be required to be experienced and knowledgeable in the substantive laws applicable to the subject matter of the controversy or claim at issue.

10.2.6 **Discovery.** The provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1283.05 or its successor section(s) are incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement. Depositions may be taken and discovery may be obtained in any arbitration under this Agreement in accordance with said section(s).

10.2.7 **Miscellaneous.** The arbitrator(s) will determine which is the prevailing party and will include in the award that party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (including allocated costs of in-house legal counsel). Each party agrees to keep all controversies and claims and the arbitration proceedings strictly confidential, except for disclosures of information required in the ordinary course of business of the parties or by applicable law or regulation.

^^**Cumulative Rights and No Waiver.** All rights and remedies granted to CNB under the Loan Documents are cumulative and no one such right or remedy is exclusive of any other. No failure or delay on the part of CNB in exercising any right or remedy will operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise or waiver by CNB of any such right or remedy will preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy.

^^**Applicable Law.** This Agreement will be governed by California law.

^^**Lien and Right of Set-off.** If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, CNB is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to Borrower or any other Person, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to setoff and apply any and all deposits (general or specific, time or savings or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and any other Debt at any time owing by CNB to or for the credit or the account of Borrower against any and all of the Obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under the Agreement and the other Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not CNB shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Documents and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of CNB under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which CNB may have under applicable law.

^^**Notices.** Any notice required or permitted under any Loan Document will be given in writing and will be deemed to have been given when personally delivered or when sent by the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, certified, return receipt requested, properly addressed.

^^**Counterparts.** This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts which, when taken together, will constitute but one agreement.
