This proxy is irrevocable, is coupled with an interest and is granted in connection with, and as security for, the Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, between Parent and the Stockholder (the “Voting Agreement”), and is granted in consideration of Parent entering into the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of the date hereof, among Parent, Alto Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and the Company (the “Merger Agreement”). This proxy will terminate on the Expiration Date (as defined in the Voting Agreement). 

Prior to the Expiration Date, the attorneys and proxies named above will be empowered, and may exercise this proxy, to vote any Shares owned by the undersigned, at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof and on every action or approval by written consent of the stockholders of the Company: 

^^in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; 

^^against any Company Acquisition Proposal (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement); and 

^^against any other action, agreement, proposal or transaction involving any of the Symyx Corporations which other action, agreement, proposal or transaction would compete with, interfere with, impede, frustrate, prevent, burden or nullify the Merger or the Merger Agreement. 

The Stockholder may vote the Shares on all other matters not referred to in this proxy, and the attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this proxy with respect to such other matters. 

This proxy shall be binding upon the heirs, estate, executors, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the Stockholder (including any transferee of any of the Shares). 

Any term or provision of this proxy that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this proxy or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this proxy so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.
