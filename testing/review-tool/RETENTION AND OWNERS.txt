^^Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, no amount payable pursuant to Section 2 or Section 3 of the Agreement which constitutes a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 409A (the "Section 409A Regulations") shall be paid unless and until Executive has incurred a Separation from Service. Furthermore, to the extent that Executive is a "specified employee" of the Company as of the date of Executive's Separation from Service, and to the extent required by the Section 409A Regulations, no amount that constitutes a deferral of compensation which is payable on account of the Employee's Separation from Service shall be paid to Executive before the date (the "Delayed Payment Date") which is the first day of the seventh month after the date of Executive's Separation from Service or, if earlier, the date of Executive's death following such Separation from Service.

To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A, the provision will be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A. Payments pursuant to this section are intended to constitute separate payments for purposes of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2) of the Section 409A Regulations. 

^^The parties intend that the payments and benefits provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement be paid in compliance with Section 409A so that no excise tax is incurred under Section 409A. To the extent permitted by Section 409A and the Section 409A Regulations, the parties agree to modify this Agreement, the timing (but not the amount(s)) of the payments or benefits provided herein, or both, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A. 

^At-Will Employment. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that Executive's employment with the Company is and shall continue to be "at-will." 

^Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute or claim between the parties, including any claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the termination of Executive's employment with the Company for any reason, Executive and the Company agree that all such disputes shall be fully resolved by binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in Santa Clara County, under the AAA's National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect, which are available online at the AAA's website at www.adr.org. Executive and the Company each acknowledge and agree that they are waiving their respective rights to have any such disputes or claims tried by a judge or jury.
