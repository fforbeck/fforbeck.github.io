^Unless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Agreement.

^A new Paragraph 11 is hereby added to the Agreement which shall state as follows:

**“Indemnification.** Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and against all claims, demands, liabilities, actions, litigations, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of the infringement of adversely owned patents, copyrights or any other intellectual property rights by reason of Buyer’s purchase and use of the Equipment.
