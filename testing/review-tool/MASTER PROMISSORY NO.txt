^^Commencing on [[Date 3: Date]] and on the last day of each month thereafter, all interest accrued on this Note at the Loan Rate during such month shall be added to the unpaid principal balance of this Note and shall thereafter accrue interest at the Loan Rate until the Maturity Date, at which time all such accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable; and

After an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, payments may be applied by Lender to amounts owed hereunder and under the Letter Agreement in such order as Lender shall determine, in its sole discretion. 

^^**Method of Payments**. All payments of principal and interest hereunder shall be paid only by wire transfer of good federal funds and shall be sent to such bank account as Lender or the legal holder or holders of this Note may from time to time designate in writing.

^**Remedies**. At the election of the holder hereof, and without notice, the principal balance remaining unpaid under this Note, and all unpaid interest accrued thereon and any other amounts due hereunder, shall be and become immediately due and payable in full upon the occurrence of any Event of Default. Failure to exercise this option shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise same in the event of any subsequent Event of Default. No holder hereof shall, by any act of omission or commission, be deemed to waive any of its rights, remedies or powers hereunder or otherwise unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the holder hereof, and then only to the extent specifically set forth therein. The rights, remedies and powers of the holder hereof, as provided in this Note and the Letter Agreement are cumulative and concurrent, and may be pursued singly, successively or together against Borrower and any security given at any time to secure the repayment hereof, all at the sole discretion of the holder hereof. If any suit or action is instituted or attorneys are employed to collect this Note or any part hereof, Borrower promises and agrees to pay all costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs. 

^**Covenants and Waivers**. Borrower hereby: (i) waives and renounces any and all homestead, redemption and exemption rights and the benefit of all valuation and appraisement privileges against the indebtedness evidenced by this Note or by any extension or renewal hereof or thereof; (ii) waives presentment and demand for payment, notices of nonpayment and of dishonor, protest of dishonor, and notice of protest; (iii) waives any and all notices in connection with the delivery and acceptance hereof and all other notices in connection with the performance, default, or enforcement of the payment hereof or hereunder; (iv) waives any and all lack of diligence and delays in the enforcement of the payment hereof; (v) agrees that the liability of Borrower and any guarantor, endorser or obligor, if applicable, shall be unconditional and without regard to the liability of any other person or entity for the payment hereof, and shall not in any manner be affected by any indulgence or forbearance granted or consented to by Lender to any of them with respect hereto; (vi) consents to any and all extensions of time, renewals, waivers, or modifications that may be granted by Lender with respect to the payment or other provisions hereof, and to the release of any security at any time given for the payment hereof, or any part thereof, with or without substitution, and to the release of any person or entity liable for the payment hereof; and (vii) consents to the addition of any and all other makers, endorsers, guarantors, and other obligors for the payment hereof, and to the acceptance of any and all other security for the payment hereof, and agree that the addition of any such makers, endorsers, guarantors or other obligors, or security shall not affect the liability of Borrower for all or any part of the obligations evidenced hereby. This provision is a material inducement for Lender making the Loan to Borrower. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Member (as defined in the Operating Agreement (as defined below)) of Borrower is a maker, endorser, guarantor or other obligor with respect to the Loan, this Note or any obligations evidenced hereby. 

^**Other General Agreements**. 

^^Time is of the essence hereof. 

^^This Note will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, to the exclusion of both its principles and rules on conflicts of laws and the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. This Note may not be changed or amended orally but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the change or amendment is sought.

^^This Note shall be binding upon and enforceable against Borrower and its successors and assigns. This Note shall inure to the benefit of and may be enforced by Lender and its successors and assigns. 

^^If any provision of this Note is deemed to be invalid by reason of the operation of law, or by reason of the interpretation placed thereon by any administrative agency or any court, Borrower and Lender shall negotiate an equitable adjustment in the provisions of the same in order to effect, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the purpose of this and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, or portions or applications thereof, shall not be affected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect. 

^^If the interest provisions herein shall result, at any time during the term of the Loan, in an effective rate of interest which, for any month, exceeds the limit of usury or other laws applicable to the Loan, all sums in excess of those lawfully collectible as interest of the period in question shall, without further agreement or notice between or by any party hereto, be applied upon principal immediately upon receipt of such monies by Lender, with the same force and effect as though the payer has specifically designated such extra sums to be so applied to principal and Lender had agreed to accept such extra payment(s) as a premium-free prepayment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Lender may at any time and from time to time elect by notice in writing to Borrower to reduce or limit the collection to such sums which, when added to the said first-stated interest, shall not result in any payments toward principal in accordance with the requirements of the preceding sentence. 

^^Lender may at any time assign its rights in this Note or any part thereof and transfer its rights in any collateral, and Lender thereafter shall be relieved from all liability with respect to any such collateral. Borrower may not assign its interest in this Note, or any other agreement with Lender or any portion thereof, either voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Lender. 

^^The Loan is a business loan which comes within the purview of Section 205/4, paragraph (h)(1)(c) of Chapter 815 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes, as amended. Borrower agrees that the Loan evidenced by this Note is an exempted transaction under the Truth In Lending Act, 15 U.S.C., §1601, et seq.
