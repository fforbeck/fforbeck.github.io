\centered W I T N E S S E T H

WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Lenders, the Swing Line Lender, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent entered into that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of [[Date 2: Date]] (as amended and modified from time to time, the "**Credit Agreement**");

WHEREAS, the Borrower previously has notified the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that (a) the Borrower has undertaken a review of whether certain revenues and associated costs under certain customer contracts, recognized during fiscal years 2002 through 2008 and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2009 by its Computer Systems segment, should be recognized in periods other than the periods in which they were recognized, and (b) the Borrower has identified certain errors during fiscal years 2002 through 2008 and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2009 in the application of accounting literature to revenue recognition for certain of these multi-year customer arrangements for telephone systems with multiple deliverables, some of which included customized software (collectively, the "Revenue Recognition Considerations"), by virtue of which it will or may be necessary to restate one or more financial statements heretofore furnished to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders;

WHEREAS, the Borrower acknowledges that, pending completion of the Revenue Recognition Considerations, it is desirable that the Loan Parties delay furnishing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders the financial statements required under Section 7.01(a) of the Credit Agreement, with respect to fiscal year 2009 (ended [[Date 3: Date]]), which delay also will affect delivery of the certificate of their independent certified public accountants required under Section 7.02(a) of the Credit Agreement and the Compliance Certificate required under Section 7.02(b) of the Credit Agreement (collectively, the "**2009 Financial Statement Deliverables**");

WHEREAS, the parties hereto have agreed (a) to temporarily extend the time for the Loan Parties to deliver the 2009 Financial Statement Deliverables, (b) to temporarily disregard the impact of the Revenue Recognition Considerations on (i) the computation of the financial covenants set forth in Section 8.11 of the Credit Agreement and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 6.05(a) and (b) of the Credit Agreement and (c) to amend the Credit Agreement as set forth herein;

fully all of their respective obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (c) by entering into this Agreement, the Lenders do not waive or release (except as specifically provided in Section 3 hereof) any term or condition of the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any of their rights or remedies under such Loan Documents or applicable law or any of the obligations of any Loan Party thereunder.
