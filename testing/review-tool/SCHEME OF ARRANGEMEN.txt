^**[Mandates, etc]** All mandates or other instructions to the Company in force at the Effective Time relating to any of the Scheme Shares (including, without limitation, elections for the payment of dividends by way of scrip (if any)) shall, mutatis mutandis immediately after the Effective Time, be deemed to be valid as effective mandates or instructions in respect of shares of Purchaser Common Stock received in consideration of the transfer of such Scheme Shares; *provided*, *however*, that nothing in this Scheme shall in any way affect the right (if any) of a shareholder of the Company to receive any dividend declared by the Company prior to the Effective Time but which has not been paid prior to the Effective Time.
