\centered **TARGET CORPORATION REPORTS APRIL SALES RESULTS**

MINNEAPOLIS, [[Date 1: Date]] -- Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) today reported that its net retail sales for the four weeks ended [[Date 2: Date]] were $[[USD Value 1: Number]] million, a decrease of 3.5 percent from $[[USD Value 2: Number]] million for the four weeks ended [[Date 3: Date]]. On this same basis, April comparable-store sales decreased 5.9 percent.

“April comparable-store sales were somewhat below our expectation. Based on our combined March and April results, we believe a greater-than-expected portion of sales that otherwise would have occurred in April were pulled forward into March,” said Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. “However, April sales in our higher margin categories remained particularly strong, and both of our business segments continued to outperform their respective profit plans for the first quarter. As a result, we now expect Target’s first quarter EPS will meet or exceed the current First Call median estimate of 86 cents.” All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.

For reference, Target’s 3.0 percent comparable-store sales increase for the combined March/[[Date 4: Date]] period was stronger than any monthly performance reported since [[Date 5: Date]].
