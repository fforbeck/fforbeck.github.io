The "Conversion Price" shall be the following price:      As applied to the Conversion Formula set forth in 2.2, [[Percentage 2: Number]]% (seventy percent) of the lowest closing price in the 20 trading days previous to the conversion; as applies to MedClean Technologies, Inc. voting common stock.
The "Maturity Date" is the date upon which the Principal Sum of this Note, as well as any unpaid interest shall be due and payable, and that date shall be:      3 (three) years from the Effective Date, as defined below on the signature page.
The “Prepayment Terms” shall be:      Prepayment is not permitted, unless approved by Holder in writing.

^^Interest Rate. Subject to the Holder's right to convert, interest payable on this Note will accrue interest at the Interest Rate and shall be applied to the Principal Sum.

^^Payable on Demand. This Note is payable on demand in an amount not to exceed the cash amount paid in towards Document C-02262010a.

The Holder will have the right to convert the Principal Sum and accrued interest under this Note into Shares of the Borrower's Common Stock as set forth below.

^^Conversion Rights and Cashless Exercise.

(as such stock exists on the date of issuance of this Note, or any shares of capital stock of MedClean Technologies, Inc. into which such stock is hereafter changed or reclassified, the "Common Stock") as per the Conversion Formula set forth in Section 2.2. Any such conversion shall be cashless, and shall not require further payment from Holder. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by both the Borrower and the Holder, at no time will the Holder convert any amount of the Note into common stock that would result in the Holder owning more than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the common stock outstanding of MedClean Technologies, Inc.

^^Reservation of Shares. As of the issuance date of this Note and for the remaining period during which the conversion right exists, the Borrower will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note. The Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The Borrower agrees that its issuance of this Note constitutes full authority to its officers, agents and transfer agents who are charged with the duty of executing and issuing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of this Note.

^^Delivery of Conversion Shares. Shares from any such conversion will be delivered to Holder by 2:30pm EST within 2 (two) business days of conversion notice delivery (see 3.1) by “DWAC/FAST” electronic transfer (see “Share Delivery” attachment). If those shares are not delivered in accordance with this timeframe stated in this Section 2.6, at any time for any reason prior to offering those shares for sale in a private transaction or in the public market through its broker, Holder may rescind that particular conversion to have the conversion amount returned to the note balance with the conversion shares returned to the Borrower. ***The Company will make its best efforts to deliver shares to Holder same day / next day.***

2.6.1. Conversion Delay Penalties. Holder may assess penalties or liquidated damages (both referred to herein as “penalties”) as follows. For each conversion, in the event that shares are not delivered by the third business day (inclusive of the day of the conversion), a penalty of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] per day will be assessed for each day after the third business day (inclusive of the day of the conversion) until share delivery is made; and such penalty will be added to the principal balance of the Note (under Holder and Borrower’s expectation that any penalty amounts will tack back to the original date of the note). Borrower will not be subjected to any penalties once its transfer agent processes the shares to the DWAC system.

^^Discharge By Payment. Conversions under this Convertible Promissory Note Document B-03262010a are available only after the Conversion Amount described herein is discharged by payment of equal or greater value from the Secured & Collateralized Promissory Note Document C-03262010a by either, at the Holder’s choice, cash payment, or surrender of security/collateral, or other negotiated form of payment mutually agreed to in writing.

^^Notices. Any notice required or permitted hereunder must be in writing and either personally served, sent by facsimile or email transmission, or sent by overnight courier. Notices will be deemed effectively delivered at the time of transmission if by facsimile or email, and if by overnight courier the business day after such notice is deposited with the courier service for delivery.

^^Amendment Provision. The term "Note" and all reference thereto, as used throughout this instrument, means this instrument as originally executed, or if later amended or supplemented, then as so amended or supplemented.

^^Assignability. This Note will be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and permitted assigns, and will inure to the benefit of the Holder and its successors and permitted assigns, and may be assigned by the Holder.

^^Maximum Payments. Nothing contained herein may be deemed to establish or require the payment of a rate of interest or other charges in excess of the maximum permitted by applicable law. In the event that the rate of interest required to be paid or other charges hereunder exceed the maximum permitted by such law, any payments in excess of such maximum will be credited against amounts owed by the Borrower to the Holder and thus refunded to the Borrower.

^^Attorney Fees. In the event any attorney is employed by either party to this Note with regard to any legal or equitable action, arbitration or other proceeding brought by such party for the enforcement of this Note or because of an alleged dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Note, the prevailing party in such proceeding will be entitled to recover from the other party reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses incurred, in addition to any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled.

Borrower acknowledges and agrees that upon submission of conversion notice as set forth in Section 3.1 (up to the amount of cash paid in under the Notes), Holder immediately owns the common shares described in the conversion notice and any sale of those shares issuable under such conversion notice would not be considered short sales.
