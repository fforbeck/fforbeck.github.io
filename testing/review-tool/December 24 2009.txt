In consideration of the premises and the agreements herein and for other consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned and the Company each hereby agree as follows:

^The undersigned hereby agrees that notwithstanding that whether or not the application of the antidilution provisions of Section 2(a)(iv) of the Existing Warrant to the transactions contemplated by the New SPA would result in a lower Exercise Price and a larger increase in the number of Warrant Shares, immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the New SPA, the Exercise Price of the Existing Warrant shall be adjusted to equal $[[USD Value 2: Number]] and the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Existing Warrant will be adjusted to equal the product of (i) the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Existing Warrant immediately prior to the execution of the New SPA and (ii) 3.3775.

^The undersigned hereby agrees that notwithstanding the provisions of the Existing Warrant, the undersigned shall not exercise the Existing Warrant (including the increase in the number of Warrant Shares contemplated in Section 1 above) during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the four month anniversary of the date hereof.

In the event that any provision of this letter agreement is found to be void or invalid, then such provision shall be deemed to be severable from the remaining provisions of this letter agreement, and it shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which provisions shall be given full effect as if the void or invalid provision had not been included herein.
