“**Initiating Holders**”) may, in their sole discretion, demand that the Corporation effect the registration of all or any part of the Eligible Securities held by the Holders for sale in Canada and/or the United States (provided, in the case of a registration in the United States, that the Corporation is, at the time such demand is made, eligible to use the U.S. Multijurisdictional Disclosure System and is then subject to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act), by delivering to the Corporation written notice requesting the Corporation to effect such registration and specifying the intended method or methods of disposition of such Eligible Securities (a “**Demand**̶ 1;).

^^Upon receipt of a Demand made pursuant to Section [2.1](#_Ref99772741)[(a)](#_Ref99772737), the Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to effect promptly the registration of such Eligible Securities for disposition in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition stated in such Demand; provided, however, that:

^the Corporation shall not be required to register, pursuant to this Section 2.1, less than 1,000,000 Common Shares (or the equivalent number of Eligible Securities);

^the Corporation shall not be required to register Eligible Securities pursuant to this Article [II](#_Ref99773721) if the Corporation delivers notice to the Holders as soon as practicable after any Demand hereunder that the Corporation in good faith believes that it will file a registration statement for a public offering of Common Shares within forty-five (45) days of such request; provided, however, that the Corporation shall have the right to refuse a registration on such grounds only one time during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months;

^the Corporation shall not be required to effect a registration pursuant to this Article [II](#_Ref99773721) within a period of ninety (90) days after the effective date of the most recent previous registration with respect to any equity securities pursuant to this Article [II](#_Ref99773721) or Article [III](#_Ref101278033) hereof; and

^if the Corporation in good faith believes that any registration or continued registration of Eligible Securities would require the disclosure of information in such registration statement that would be materially detrimental to the Corporation and its shareholders (and such information would not be required to be disclosed if such registration statement were not filed) or the disclosure of which would materially adversely affect the Corporation’s ability to consummate a material acquisition, corporate reorganization or merger or other transaction involving the Corporation (a “**Valid Business Reason**”):

^^^the Corporation may postpone filing a registration statement relating to a Demand until such Valid Business Reason no longer exists, but in no event for more than ninety (90) days, and

^^^in case a registration statement has been filed relating to a Demand, if the Valid Business Reason has not resulted from actions taken by the

Corporation, the Corporation may cause such registration statement to be withdrawn or may postpone amending or supplementing such registration statement until such Valid Business Reason no longer exists, but in no event for more than sixty (60) days (such period of postponement or withdrawal under Sections [2.1(b)(4)(i)](#_Ref101279051) and [2.1(b)(4)(ii)](#_Ref101279078), the “**Postponement Period**”);

and the Corporation shall give written notice of its determination to postpone or withdraw a registration statement and of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for such postponement or withdrawal no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence thereof. If the Corporation gives any notice of postponement or withdrawal of any registration statement, the Corporation shall not, during the period of postponement or withdrawal, register or continue the registration of any Common Shares. Each Holder of Eligible Securities agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Corporation that the Corporation has determined to withdraw any registration statement pursuant to Section [2.1(b)(4)(ii)](#_Ref101279078) above, such party will discontinue its disposition of Eligible Securities pursuan t to such registration statement and, if so directed by the Corporation, will deliver to the Corporation (at the Corporation’s expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such party’s possession, of the prospectus covering such Eligible Securities that was in effect at the time of receipt of such notice. If the Corporation shall have withdrawn a registration statement filed under this Article [II](#_Ref99773721), the Corporation shall pay all expenses incurred by the Holders in connection with such registration statement and shall not be considered to have effected an effective registration for the purposes of this Agreement until the Corporation shall have filed a new registration statement covering the Eligible Securities covered by the withdrawn registration statement and such registration statement shall have been declared effective and shall not have been withdrawn. If the Corporation shall give any notice of withdrawal or postponement of a registration statement, the Corporation shall, at such time as the Valid Business Reason that caused such withdrawal or postponement no longer exists (but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the date of the withdrawal or postponement), confirm that the Initiating Holder still wishes to effect a registration of Eligible Securities under this [Article II](#_Ref99773721) and, if the Initiating Holder so confirms, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration of the Eligible Securities covered by the withdrawn or postponed registration statement in accordance with this Article [II](#_Ref99773721); provided that if the Initiating Holder advises the Corporation that it does not wish to proceed with such registration, the Corporation shall not be considered to have effected an effective registration for purposes of this Agreement. The Corporation agrees that it shall have the right to postpone or withdraw a registration statement pursuant to this Section [2.1(b)(4)](#_Ref101279319) only one time during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months.

^^**Number of Registrations**. The Holders collectively (including their transferees) shall have the right to request no more than three (3) registrations pursuant to this Article [II](#_Ref99773721); provided, however, that (i) a registration will not count as a Demand until it has become effective (unless the requesting Holders withdraw all their Eligible Securities and the Corporation has performed its obligations hereunder in all material respects, in which case such request will count as a Demand unless the req uesting Holders pay all Registration

Expenses in connection with such withdrawn registration); provided, further, that if, after a registration has become effective, an offering of Eligible Securities pursuant to such registration is (A) withdrawn or postponed in accordance with Section [2.1](#_Ref99772741)[(b)](#_Ref101776767)[(4)](#_Ref101279319) or (B) interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental agency or court, such registration will be deemed not to have been effected and will not count as a Demand; and (ii) a concurrent registration in the United States and Canada shall be deemed to be one occasion of registration only.

^^**Registration Expenses**. If the Corporation has obtained an opinion of its outside counsel that the Eligible Securities in respect of which a Demand has been made may be sold without registration under Canadian Securities Laws (under reasonable assumptions made by such counsel), the Corporation shall be responsible for the payment of [[Percentage 5: Number]]% of all Registration Expenses, and the Holders shall be responsible for the balance of such Registration Expenses, in connection with a registration pursuant to this Article [II](#_Ref99773721), except as may be required by law. For greater certainty, counsel to the Corporation shall be enti tled to assume, for the purposes of such opinion that the Selling Shareholder does not have any agreement or understanding to act in combination with any other Person who is at arm’s length with the Selling Shareholder in respect of the control of the Corporation. If the Corporation has not obtained such an opinion, it shall be responsible for the payment of all Registration Expenses in connection with such registration.

^^**Third Person Common Shares**. The Corporation shall, subject to the provisions of Section [3.1](#_Ref99773692), permit the registration of Eligible Securities for sale for the account of any Holder who delivers a request for a registration in any registration of Eligible Securities requested by another Holder pursuant to this Article [II](#_Ref99773721). The Initiating Holder and all other Holders participating in the particular registration pursuant to this Article [II](#_Ref99773721) shall be jointly and severally liable to the Corporation for all expenses of the registration which are to b e borne by Holders as provided in Section [2.3](#_Ref102799116).

^\centered INCIDENTAL REGISTRATION

^^**Notice and Registration**. At any time after the earlier to occur of the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date and the release of the Corporation and Leucadia from the guarantees to be given under the Syndicated Loan, whenever the Corporation proposes to register Eligible Securities in a registration statement that would permit the public sale of such securities under the Securities Laws (whether proposed to be offered for sale by the Corporation or any other Person, whether pursuant to Article [II](#_Ref99773721) or in any other registration pursuant to this Article [III](#_Ref101278033)), the Corporation shall give written notice to all Holders at least ten (10) Business Days before the filing of such registration statement of its intention to effect such registration, including the identities of any Holders exercising registration rights pursuant to Article [II](#_Ref99773721) hereof; provided, however, that the Investors and any Holders who are Affiliates of the Investors will be deemed to have received notice of any proposed registration considered by the Board for so long as Leucadia has a representative on the

Upon the written request of any Holder delivered to the Corporation within ten (10) Business Days after the giving of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of Eligible Securities intended to be disposed of by such Holder and the intended method of disposition thereof), the Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration of all Eligible Securities which the Corporation has been so requested to register by such Holder to the extent required to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended method or methods thereof as aforesaid) of the Eligible Securities so to be registered; provided, however, that:

^^in the event that the Corporation proposes to register Eligible Securities for purposes of a primary offering for the account of the Corporation prior to a Demand pursuant to Article II hereof, and any managing underwriter shall advise the Corporation and the Selling Shareholders in writing that, in its opinion, the inclusion in the registration statement of some or all of the Eligible Securities sought to be registered by such Selling Shareholders creates a substantial risk that the price per unit the Corporation will derive from such registration will be materially and adversely affected, then the Corporation will include in such registration s tatement such number of Eligible Securities as the Corporation and such Selling Shareholders are so advised can be sold in such offering without such an effect (the “**Primary Maximum Number**”), as follows and in the following order of priority: (i) first, such number of Eligible Securities in the primary offering as the Corporation, in its reasonable judgment and acting in good faith and in accordance with sound financial practice, shall have determined; and (ii) second and subject of Section [8.3](#_Ref101777122), if and to the extent that the number of Eligible Securities to be registered under clause (i) is less than the Primary Maximum Number, Eligible Securities requested to be included by each Selling Shareholder, pro rata in proportion to the number sought to be registered by all the Selling Shareholders;

^^the Corporation shall not be required to effect any registration of Eligible Securities under this Article [III](#_Ref101278033) incidental to the registration of any of its securities in connection with mergers, amalgamations, acquisitions, exchange offers, subscription offers, dividend reinvestment plans or options or other employee benefit plans.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no registration of Eligible Securities effected under this Article [III](#_Ref101278033) shall relieve the Corporation of its obligation to effect any registration of Eligible Securities pursuant to Article [II](#_Ref99773721).

^^**Registration Expenses**. The Corporation (as between the Corporation and any Holder) shall be responsible for the payment of all Registration Expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to this Article [III](#_Ref101278033), except as may be required by law.

^^Leucadia shall be entitled to nominate an individual for election to the Inmet Board at each meeting of shareholders of Inmet at which the election of the board of directors is being considered, provided that at such time that Leucadia ceases to own, directly or indirectly, at least the Minimum Shareholding, Leucadia shall have no further entitlement as of right to nominate a member of the Board, but provided always that nothing in this Agreement shall in any case preclude Leucadia’s nominees from thereafter presenting themselves as candidates to be elected to the Board and to sit and hold office as a member of the Board if so elected. Any individual nominated by Leucadia in accordance with this Article X shall be referred to herein as a “**Leucadia Nominee**.”

^^For so long as Leucadia is entitled to nominate a Leucadia Nominee, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to enable a Leucadia Nominee who is not resident in Canada (for purposes of the Canada Business Corporations Act) to sit and hold office as a member of the Board if elected.

^^**Notice of Election of Directors**. At any time and from time to time, if the Corporation determines that it is necessary or advisable to hold a meeting of its shareholders at which the election or removal of directors to or from the Board is to be considered (unless such meeting does not involve the removal or replacement of any Leucadia Nominee then serving on the Board in which case the provisions of this Section [10.2](#_Ref102639221) do not apply), the Corporation shall forthwith upon such determination provide written notice of its intention to take such action to Leucadia, which notice must be provided sufficiently in adv ance of the date on which proxy solicitation materials are mailed by the Corporation in connection with such election or removal of directors in order to enable Leucadia to comply with the provisions of Section [10.3](#_Ref102639076) and such that the Corporation shall be able to fulfill its obligations under Section [10.4](#_Ref102639107).

^^**Approving Nominees**.

In the event that the Corporation determines in good faith, after consulting with and taking advice from counsel (such determination to be completed within three (3) Business Days of receipt a Notice of Nom ination), that a Leucadia Nominee would not be an Eligible Candidate, the Corporation shall promptly notify Leucadia of such determination with an explanation of the basis therefor, and provided that Leucadia, with the timely good faith cooperation of the Corporation, puts forth an alternative Person who would be an Eligible Candidate sufficiently in advance of the date on which proxy solicitation materials are to be printed for mailing to the Corporation’s shareholders, the Corporation shall present and recommend such Eligible Candidate for election to the Board in such proxy materials.

^^**Management to Endorse and Vote**. The management of the Corporation agree that they shall in respect of every meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation at which the election of directors to the Board is considered and at every reconvened meeting following an adjournment thereof or postponement thereof endorse and recommend the Leucadia Nominee who is an Eligible Candidate identified in the proxy materials for election to the Board, and shall vote their Common Shares in favor of the election of such Leucadia Nominee to the Board at every such meeting.

If any vacancy on the Board occurs by reason of a Leucadia Nominee ceasing to serve as a director (whether by death, resignation, disqualification or removal for cause) at any time between mee tings of the shareholders of the Corporation, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause such vacancy to be filled and only a Leucadia Nominee shall be qualified to fill such vacancy, provided that Leucadia, at the time of such vacancy, is still entitled to nominate a Leucadia Nominee and puts forward an Eligible Candidate.

^\centered MISCELLANEOUS

^^**Captions**. The captions or headings in this Agreement are for convenience and reference only, and in no way define, describe, extend or limit the scope or intent of this Agreement.
