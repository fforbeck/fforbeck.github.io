^Exchange Offer

^^Unless the Exchange Offer shall not be permissible under applicable law or SEC policy, the Company shall file with the SEC, no later than the Filing Date, a Registration Statement (the “Exchange Offer Registration Statement”) on an appropriate registration form with respect to a registered offer (the “Exchange Offer”) to exchange any and all of the Registrable Notes for a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities of the Company (the “Exchange Notes”), that are identical in all material respects to the Notes, except that (i) the Exchange Notes shall contain no restrictive legend thereon and (ii) interest thereon shall accrue from the last date on which interest was paid on the Notes or if no such interest has been paid, from the Issue Date, and which are entitled to the benefits of the Indenture or a trust indenture which is identical in all material respects to the Indenture (other than such changes to the Indenture or any such identical trust indenture as are necessary to comply with the TIA) and which, in either case, conforms to the requirements necessary for qualification under the TIA. The Exchange Offer shall comply with all applicable tender offer rules and regulations under the Exchange Act and other applicable laws. The Company shall (x) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act on or before the Effectiveness Date and (y) commence the Exchange Offer and use commercially reasonable efforts to issue the Exchange Notes on or prior to the 270th day following the Issue Date. 

Each Holder (including, without limitation, each Participating Broker-Dealer) who participates in the Exchange Offer will be required to represent to the Company in writing (which may be contained in the applicable letter of transmittal) that: (i) any Exchange Notes acquired in exchange for Registrable Notes tendered are being acquired in the ordinary course of business of the Person receiving such Exchange Notes, whether or not such recipient is such Holder itself; (ii) at the time of the commencement or consummation of the Exchange Offer neither such Holder nor, to the actual knowledge of such Holder, any other Person receiving Exchange Notes from such Holder has an arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in the “distribution” (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Exchange Notes in violation of the provisions of the Securities Act; (iii) neither the Holder nor, to the actual knowledge of such Holder, any other Person receiving Exchange Notes from such Holder is an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 405) of the Company or, if it is an affiliate of the Company, it will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable and will provide information to be included in the Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with Section 5 hereof in order to have their Notes included in the Shelf Registration Statement and benefit from the provisions regarding Additional Interest in Section 4 hereof; (iv) neither such Holder nor, to the actual knowledge of such Holder, any other Person receiving Exchange Notes from such Holder is engaging in or intends to engage in a “distribution” (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Exchange Notes; and (v) if such Holder is a Participating Broker-Dealer, such Holder has acquired the Registrable Notes as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities and that it will comply with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act (including, but not limited to, the prospectus delivery requirements thereunder) in connection with any resale of the Exchange Notes. 

Upon consummation of the Exchange Offer in accordance with this Section 2, the provisions of this Agreement shall continue to apply, mutatis mutandis, solely with respect to Registrable Notes that are Private Exchange Notes, Exchange Notes as to which Section 2(c)(iv) is applicable and Exchange Notes held by Participating Broker-Dealers, and the Company shall have no further obligation to register Registrable Notes (other than Private Exchange Notes and Exchange Notes as to which clause 2(c)(iv) hereof applies) pursuant to Section 3 hereof. 

No securities other than the Exchange Notes shall be included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. 

^^The Company shall include within the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement a section entitled “Plan of Distribution,” reasonably acceptable to the Initial Purchasers, which shall contain a summary statement of the positions taken or policies made by the staff of the SEC with respect to the potential “underwriter” status of any broker-dealer that is the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of Exchange Notes received by such broker-dealer in the Exchange Offer (a “Participating Broker-Dealer”), whether such positions or policies have been publicly disseminated by the staff of the SEC or such positions or policies represent the prevailing views of the staff of the SEC. Such “Plan of Distribution” section shall also expressly permit, to the extent permitted by applicable policies and regulations of the SEC, the use of the Prospectus by all Persons subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act, including, to the extent permitted by applicable policies and regulations of the SEC, all Participating Broker-Dealers, and include a statement describing the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Notes in compliance with the Securities Act. 

The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective and to amend and supplement the Prospectus contained therein in order to permit such Prospectus to be lawfully delivered by all Persons subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act for such period of time as is necessary to comply with applicable law in connection with any resale of the Exchange Notes; provided, however, that such period shall not be required to exceed 90 days or such longer period if extended pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 5 hereof (the “Applicable Period”). 

If, prior to consummation of the Exchange Offer, the Initial Purchasers hold any Notes acquired by them that have the status of an unsold allotment in the initial distribution, the Company, upon the request of the Initial Purchasers, shall simultaneously with the delivery of the Exchange Notes issue and deliver to the Initial Purchasers, in exchange (the “Private Exchange”) for such Notes held by any such Holder, a like principal amount of notes (the “Private Exchange Notes”) of the Company, that are identical in all material respects to the Exchange Notes except for the placement of a restrictive legend on such Private Exchange Notes. The Private Exchange Notes shall be issued pursuant to the same indenture as the Exchange Notes and bear the same CUSIP number as the Exchange Notes if permitted by the CUSIP Service Bureau. 

In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company shall: 

^mail, or cause to be mailed, to each Holder of record entitled to participate in the Exchange Offer a copy of the Prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents; 

^use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer open for not less than 30 days after the date that notice of the Exchange Offer is mailed to Holders (or longer if required by applicable law); 

^utilize the services of a depositary for the Exchange Offer with an address in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of [[Address 2: Address]] 

^permit Holders to withdraw tendered Notes at any time prior to the close of business, [[Address 3: Address]], on the last Business Day on which the Exchange Offer remains open; and 

^otherwise comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

As soon as practicable after the close of the Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange, if any, the Company shall: 

^accept for exchange all Registrable Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange, if any; 

^deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all Registrable Notes so accepted for exchange; and 

^cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each Holder of Notes, Exchange Notes or Private Exchange Notes, as the case may be, equal in principal amount to the Notes of such Holder so accepted for exchange; provided that, in the case of any Notes held in global form by a depositary, authentication and delivery to such depositary of one or more replacement Notes in global form in an equivalent principal amount thereto for the account of such Holders in accordance with the Indenture shall satisfy such authentication and delivery requirement. 

The Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange shall not be subject to any conditions, other than that (i) the Exchange Offer or Private Exchange, as the case may be, does not violate applicable law or any SEC policy; (ii) no action or proceeding shall have been instituted or threatened in any court or by any governmental agency which might materially impair the ability of the Company to proceed with the Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange, and no material adverse development shall have occurred in any existing action or proceeding with respect to the Company; and (iii) all governmental approvals shall have been obtained, which approvals the Company deems necessary for the consummation of the Exchange Offer or Private Exchange. 

The Exchange Notes and the Private Exchange Notes shall be issued under (i) the Indenture or (ii) an indenture identical in all material respects to the Indenture and which, in either case, conforms to the requirements necessary for qualification under the TIA or is exempt from such qualification and shall provide that the Exchange Notes shall not be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture or such indenture shall provide that the Exchange Notes, the Private Exchange Notes and the Notes shall vote and consent together on all matters as one class and that none of the Exchange Notes, the Private Exchange Notes or the Notes will have the right to vote or consent as a separate class on any matter. 

^^If, (i) because of any change in law or in currently prevailing SEC policy, the Company is not permitted to effect the Exchange Offer, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not consummated within 270 days of the Issue Date, (iii) any holder of Private Exchange Notes so requests in writing to the Company at any time after the consummation of the Exchange Offer, or (iv) in the case of any Holder that participates in the Exchange Offer, such Holder does not receive Exchange Notes on the date of the exchange that may be sold without restriction under state and federal securities laws (other than due solely to the status of such Holder as an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act) and so notifies the Company within 30 days after such Holder first becomes aware of such restrictions, in the case of each of clauses (i) to and including (iv) of this sentence, then the Company shall promptly deliver to the Holders and the Trustee written notice thereof (the “Shelf Notice”) and shall file a Shelf Registration pursuant to Section 3 hereof. 

^Shelf Registration

If at any time a Shelf Notice is delivered as contemplated by Section 2(c) hereof, then: 

^^Shelf Registration. The Company shall as promptly as practicable file with the SEC a Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of the Registrable Notes (the “Initial Shelf Registration”). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC the Initial Shelf Registration on or prior to the applicable Filing Date. The Initial Shelf Registration shall be an appropriate form permitting registration of such Registrable Notes for resale by Holders in the manner or manners designated by them (including, without limitation, one or more underwritten offerings). The Company shall not permit any securities other than the Registrable Notes to be included in the Initial Shelf Registration or any Subsequent Shelf Registration (as defined below). 

The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Initial Shelf Registration to be declared effective under the Securities Act on or prior to the Effectiveness Date and to keep the Initial Shelf Registration continuously effective under the Securities Act until the date that is two years from the Issue Date or such shorter period ending when all Registrable Notes covered by the Initial Shelf Registration have been sold in the manner set forth and as contemplated in the Initial Shelf Registration or, if applicable, a Subsequent Shelf Registration (the “Effectiveness Period”); provided, however, that the Effectiveness Period in respect of the Initial Shelf Registration shall be extended to the extent required to permit dealers to comply with the applicable prospectus delivery requirements of Rule 174 under the Securities Act and as otherwise provided herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time, the Company may delay the filing of any Initial Shelf Registration Statement or delay or suspend the effectiveness thereof, for a reasonable period of time, but not in excess of an aggregate of 75 days in any calendar year (a “Shelf Suspension Period”), if the Board of Directors of the Company determines reasonably and in good faith that the filing of any such Initial Shelf Registration Statement or the continuing effectiveness thereof would require the disclosure of non-public material information that, in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, would be detrimental to the Company if so disclosed or would otherwise materially adversely affect a financing, acquisition, disposition, merger or other material transaction. 

^^Withdrawal of Stop Orders; Subsequent Shelf Registrations. If the Initial Shelf Registration or any Subsequent Shelf Registration ceases to be effective for any reason at any time during the Effectiveness Period (other than because of the sale of all of the Notes registered thereunder or during a Shelf Suspension Period as permitted by Section 3(a)), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness thereof, and in any event shall within 30 days of such cessation of effectiveness amend such Shelf Registration Statement in a manner to obtain the withdrawal of the order suspending the effectiveness thereof, or file an additional Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to 

Rule 415 covering all of the Registrable Notes covered by and not sold under the Initial Shelf Registration or an earlier Subsequent Shelf Registration (each, a “Subsequent Shelf Registration”). If a Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Subsequent Shelf Registration to be declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as practicable after such filing and to keep such subsequent Shelf Registration continuously effective for a period equal to the number of days in the Effectiveness Period less the aggregate number of days during which the Initial Shelf Registration or any Subsequent Shelf Registration was previously effective. As used herein the term “Shelf Registration” means the Initial Shelf Registration and any Subsequent Shelf Registration. 

^^Supplements and Amendments. The Company shall promptly supplement and amend the Shelf Registration if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used for such Shelf Registration, if required by the Securities Act, or if reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Notes (or their counsel) covered by such Registration Statement with respect to the information included therein with respect to one or more of such Holders, or by any underwriter of such Registrable Notes with respect to the information included therein with respect to such underwriter. 

^Additional Interest

^^The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that the Holders will suffer damages if the Company fails to fulfill its obligations under Section 2 or Section 3 hereof and that it would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with precision. Accordingly, the Company agrees to pay, as liquidated damages, additional interest on the Notes (“Additional Interest”) under the circumstances and to the extent set forth below (each of which shall be given independent effect): 

^^^if (A) neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Initial Shelf Registration has been filed on or prior to the Filing Date applicable thereto or (B) notwithstanding that the Company has consummated or will consummate the Exchange Offer, the Company is required to file a Shelf Registration and such Shelf Registration is not filed on or prior to the Filing Date applicable thereto, then, commencing on the day after any such Filing Date, Additional Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Notes at a rate of [[Percentage 2: Number]]% per annum for the first 90 days immediately following such applicable Filing Date, and such Additional Interest rate shall increase by an additional [[Percentage 2]]% per annum at the beginning of each subsequent 90 day period; or 

^^^if (A) neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Initial Shelf Registration is declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the Effectiveness Date applicable thereto or (B) notwithstanding that the Company has consummated or will consummate the Exchange Offer, the Company is required to file a Shelf Registration and such Shelf Registration is not declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the Effectiveness Date applicable to such Shelf Registration, then, commencing on the day after such Effectiveness Date, Additional Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Notes at a rate of [[Percentage 2]]% per annum for the first 90 days immediately following the day after such Effectiveness Date, and such Additional Interest rate shall increase by an additional [[Percentage 2]]% per annum at the beginning of each subsequent 90 day period; or 

^^^if (A) the Company has not exchanged the Exchange Notes for all Notes validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offer on or prior to the 30th Business Day after the Effectiveness Date, as applicable to an Exchange Offer Registration Statement, or (B) if applicable, a Shelf Registration has been declared effective and such Shelf Registration ceases to be effective at any time during the Effectiveness Period, then Additional Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Notes at a rate of [[Percentage 2]]% per annum for the first 90 days commencing on the (x) the following day after the 30th Business Day after the Effectiveness Date, in the case of (A) above, or (y) the day such Shelf Registration ceases to be effective in the case of (B) above, and such Additional Interest rate shall increase by an additional [[Percentage 2]]% per annum at the beginning of each such subsequent 90-day period; 

provided, however, that the Additional Interest rate on the Notes may not accrue under more than one of the foregoing clauses (i) - (iii) at any one time and at no time shall the aggregate amount of additional interest accruing exceed in the aggregate [[Percentage 3: Number]]% per annum; provided, further, however, that (1) upon the filing of the applicable Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the applicable Shelf Registration as required hereunder (in the case of clause (i) above of this Section 4), (2) upon the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the applicable Shelf Registration Statement as required hereunder (in the case of clause (ii) of this Section 4), or (3) upon the exchange of the Exchange Notes for all Notes tendered (in the case of clause (iii)(A) of this Section 4), or upon the effectiveness of the applicable Shelf Registration Statement which had ceased to remain effective (in the case of (iii)(B) of this Section 4), Additional Interest on the Notes in respect of which such events relate as a result of such clause (or the relevant subclause thereof), as the case may be, shall cease to accrue. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4, the Company shall not be obligated to pay Additional Interest provided in Sections 4(a)(i)(B), 4(a)(ii)(B) or 4(a)(iii)(B) during a Shelf Suspension Period permitted by Section 3(a) hereof. 

^^The Company shall notify the Trustee within one Business Day after each and every date on which an event occurs in respect of which Additional Interest is required to be paid (an “Event Date”). Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) of this Section 4 will be payable in cash semiannually on each [[Date 3: Date]] and [[Date 4: Date]] (to the holders of record on the [[Date 5: Date]] and [[Date 6: Date]] immediately preceding such dates), commencing with the first such date occurring after any such Additional Interest commences to accrue. The amount of Additional Interest will be determined by multiplying the applicable Additional Interest rate by the principal amount of the Registrable Notes, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Additional Interest rate was applicable during such period (determined on the basis of a 360 day year comprised of twelve 30 day months and, in the case of a partial month, the actual number of days elapsed), and the denominator of which is 360. 

^^The liquidated damages set forth in this Section 4 shall be the exclusive remedy for the Holders if the Company fails to fulfill its obligations under Section 2 or Section 3 hereof. 

^Registration Procedures

In connection with the filing of any Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2 or 3 hereof, the Company shall effect such registration to permit the sale of the securities covered thereby in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto and in connection with any Registration Statement filed by the Company hereunder, the Company shall: 

^^Prepare and file with the SEC on or prior to the applicable Filing Date a Registration Statement or Registration Statements as prescribed by Section 2 or 3 hereof, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein; provided, however, that if (1) such filing is pursuant to Section 3 hereof or (2) a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period relating thereto from whom the Company has received prior written notice that it will be a Participating Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, before filing any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, the Company shall furnish to and afford the Holders of the Registrable Notes covered by such Registration Statement (with respect to a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof) or each such Participating Broker-Dealer (with respect to any such Registration Statement), as the case may be, their counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, a reasonable opportunity to review copies of all such documents (including copies of any documents to be incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits thereto) proposed to be filed (in each case at least five Business Days prior to such filing). The Company shall not file any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto if the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Notes covered by such Registration Statement, their counsel, or the managing underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object on a timely basis. 

^^Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to each Shelf Registration Statement or Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as the case may be, as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective for the Effectiveness Period, the Applicable Period or until consummation of the Exchange Offer, as the case may be; cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any Prospectus supplement required by applicable law, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act applicable to it with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented and with respect to the subsequent resale of any securities being sold by a Participating Broker-Dealer covered by any such Prospectus. The Company shall be deemed not to have used its commercially reasonable efforts to keep a Registration Statement effective if the Company voluntarily takes any action that would result in selling Holders of the Registrable Notes covered thereby or Participating Broker-Dealers seeking to sell Exchange Notes not being able to sell such Registrable Notes or such Exchange Notes during that period unless such action is required by applicable law or permitted by this Agreement. 

^^If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof, or (2) a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period relating thereto from whom the Company has received written notice that it will be a Participating Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, notify the selling Holders of Registrable Notes (with respect to a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof), or each such Participating Broker-Dealer (with respect to any such Registration Statement), as the case may be, their counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, promptly (but in any event within one Business Day), and confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective under the Securities Act (including in such notice a written statement that any Holder may, upon request, obtain, at the sole expense of the Company, one conformed copy of such Registration Statement or post-effective amendment including financial statements and schedules, documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference and exhibits), (ii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iii) if at any time when a prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Registrable Notes or resales of Exchange Notes by Participating Broker-Dealers the representations and warranties of the Company contained in any agreement (including any underwriting agreement) contemplated by Section 5(n) hereof cease to be true and correct, (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of a Registration Statement or any of the Registrable Notes or the Exchange Notes to be sold by any Participating Broker-Dealer for offer or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (v) of the happening of any event, the existence of any condition or any information becoming known that makes any statement made in such Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in or amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (vi) of the Company’s determination that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate. 

^^Use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of a Prospectus or suspending the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Notes or the Exchange Notes to be sold by any Participating Broker-Dealer, for sale in any jurisdiction, and, if any such order is issued, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest practicable moment.

^^Provide an indenture trustee for the Registrable Notes or the Exchange Notes, as the case may be, and, unless exempt from qualification, cause the Indenture or the trust indenture provided for in Section 2(a) hereof, as the case may be, to be qualified under the TIA not later than the effective date of the first Registration Statement relating to the Registrable Notes; and in connection therewith, cooperate with the trustee under any such indenture and the Holders of the Registrable Notes, to effect such changes (if any) to such indenture as may be required for such indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA; and execute, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes, and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to enable such indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner. 

^^Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and make generally available to its securityholders with regard to any applicable Registration Statement, a consolidated earning statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or any similar rule promulgated under the Securities Act) no later than 45 days after the end of any fiscal quarter (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month period if such period is a fiscal year) (i) commencing at the end of any fiscal quarter in which Registrable Notes are sold to underwriters in a firm commitment or best efforts underwritten offering and (ii) if not sold to underwriters in such an offering, commencing on the first day of the first fiscal quarter of the Company, after the effective date of a Registration Statement, which statements shall cover said 12-month periods. 

^^Upon consummation of the Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange, obtain an opinion of counsel to the Company, in a form customary for underwritten transactions, addressed to the Trustee for the benefit of all Holders of Registrable Notes participating in the Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange, as the case may be, that the Exchange Notes or Private Exchange Notes, as the case may be, and the related indenture each constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to customary exceptions and qualifications. If the Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange is to be consummated, upon delivery of the Registrable Notes by Holders to the Company (or to such other Person as directed by the Company), in exchange for the Exchange Notes or the Private Exchange Notes, as the case may be, the Company shall mark, or cause to be marked, on such Registrable Notes that such Registrable Notes are being cancelled in exchange for the Exchange Notes or the Private Exchange Notes, as the case may be; in no event shall such Registrable Notes be marked as paid or otherwise satisfied. 

^^Cooperate with each seller of Registrable Notes covered by any Registration Statement and each underwriter, if any, participating in the disposition of such Registrable Notes and their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made with FINRA. 

^^Use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all other steps necessary to effect the registration of the Exchange Notes and/or Registrable Notes covered by a Registration Statement contemplated hereby. 

The Company may require each seller of Registrable Notes as to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the Company such information regarding such seller and the distribution of such Registrable Notes as the Company may, from time to time, reasonably request. The Company may exclude from such registration the Registrable Notes of any seller so long as such seller fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request. Each seller as to which any Shelf Registration is being effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such seller not materially misleading. 

If any such Registration Statement refers to any Holder by name or otherwise as the holder of any securities of the Company, then such Holder shall have the right to require (i) the insertion therein of language, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Holder, to the effect that the holding by such Holder of such securities is not to be construed as a recommendation by such Holder of the investment quality of the securities covered thereby and that such holding does not imply that such Holder will assist in meeting any future financial requirements of the Company, or (ii) in the event that such reference to such Holder by name or otherwise is not required by the Securities Act or any similar federal statute then in force, the deletion of the reference to such Holder in any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement filed or prepared subsequent to the time that such reference ceases to be required. 

Each Holder of Registrable Notes and each Participating Broker-Dealer agrees by its acquisition of such Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes to be sold by such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, that, upon actual receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 5(c)(ii), 5(c)(iv), 5(c)(v), or 5(c)(vi) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable 

Notes covered by such Registration Statement or Prospectus or Exchange Notes to be sold by such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, until such Holder’s or Participating Broker-Dealer’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 5(k) hereof, or until it is advised in writing (the “Advice”) by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any amendments or supplements thereto. In the event that the Company shall give any such notice, each of the Applicable Period and the Effectiveness Period shall be extended by the number of days during such periods from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when each seller of Registrable Notes covered by such Registration Statement or Exchange Notes to be sold by such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, shall have received (x) the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 5(k) hereof or (y) the Advice. 

^Registration Expenses

^^^any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact made by the Company contained in any application or any other document or any amendment or supplement thereto executed by the Company based upon written information furnished by or on behalf of the Company filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify the Notes under the securities or “Blue Sky” laws thereof or filed with the SEC or any securities association or securities exchange (each, an “Application”); 

^^^any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus; or 

^^^the omission or alleged omission to state, in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or any Application or any other document or any amendment or supplement thereto, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and will reimburse, as incurred, the Participant for any legal or other expenses incurred by the Participant in connection with investigating, defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or Application or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Participant furnished to the Company by such Participant specifically for use therein. The indemnity provided for in this Section 7 will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have to the indemnified parties. The Company shall not be liable under this Section 7 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without their prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Each Participant shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, effect any settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the Company is or could have been a party, or indemnity could have been sought hereunder by the Company, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional written release of the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the Company. 

^^Each Participant, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company or its affiliates within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or Application, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus, or (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Participant, furnished to the Company by the Participant, specifically for use therein; and subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, will reimburse, as incurred, any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending against or appearing as a third party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof. The indemnity provided for in this Section 7 will be in addition to any liability that the Participants may otherwise have to the indemnified parties. The Participants shall not be liable under this 

Section 7 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without their consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of such Participant, effect any settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such Participant is or could have been a party, or indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Participant, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional written release of such Participant, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Participant, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of such Participant. 

^^Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action for which such indemnified party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 7, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof in writing; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from any liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after receipt by the indemnifying party of notice of the institution of such action, then, in each such case, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties and such indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and approval by such indemnified party of counsel appointed to defend such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that in connection with such action the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) in any one action or separate but substantially similar actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, designated by Participants who sold a majority in interest of the Registrable Notes and Exchange Notes sold by all such Participants in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 7 or the Company in the case of paragraph (b) of this Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action or actions) or (ii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. All fees and expenses reimbursed pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. After such notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party, the indemnifying party will not be liable for the costs and expenses of any settlement of such action effected by such indemnified party without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless such indemnified party waived in writing its rights under this Section 7, in which case the indemnified party may effect such a settlement without such consent. 

^^In circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 7 is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless, an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities other than by reason of exceptions provided in this Section 7 (or actions in respect thereof), each indemnifying party, in order to provide for just and equitable contribution, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by the foregoing clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof). The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Participant on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) of the Notes received by the Company bear to the total net profit received by such Participant in connection with the sale of the Notes. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand, or the Participants on the other, the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or alleged statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. The parties agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (d). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (d), no Participant shall be obligated to make contributions hereunder that in the aggregate exceed the total net profit received by such Participant in connection with the sale of the Notes, less the aggregate amount of any damages that such Participant has otherwise been required to pay by reason of the untrue or alleged untrue statements or the omissions or alleged omissions to state a material fact, and no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this paragraph (d), each person, if any, who controls a Participant within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Participants, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. 

^Rules 144 and 144A

The Company covenants and agrees that they will file the reports required to be filed by them under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, if at any time the Company is not required to file such reports, the Company will, upon the request of any Holder or beneficial owner of Registrable Notes, make available such information necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144A. The Company further covenants and agrees, for so long as any Registrable Notes remain outstanding that they will take such further action as any Holder of Registrable Notes may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Notes without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 and Rule 144A. 

^Underwritten Registrations

If any of the Registrable Notes covered by any Shelf Registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Registrable Notes included in such offering and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. 

No Holder of Registrable Notes may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder’s Registrable Notes on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 

^Miscellaneous

^^No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not as of the date hereof, and the Company shall not after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to any of its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Notes in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Company’s other issued and outstanding securities under any such agreements. The Company will not enter into any agreement with respect to any of their securities which will grant to any Person piggy-back registration rights with respect to any Registration Statement. 

^^Adjustments Affecting Registrable Notes.
