^Restrictive Legend. Each certificate representing Shares shall, except as otherwise provided in this Section 2 or in Section 3, be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend substantially in the following form:

“THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED UNLESS SUCH SALE OR TRANSFER IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH ACT AND APPLICABLE LAWS OR AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH ACT AND APPLICABLE LAWS IS AVAILABLE WITH RESPECT THERETO.”

^certificate shall not bear such legend if in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company addressed to the Company and any transfer agent for the securities represented thereby to the effect that such securities may be publicly sold without registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. 

^Notice of Proposed Transfer. Prior to any proposed transfer of the Shares (other than under the circumstances described in Sections 4, 5 or 6), the holder thereof shall give written notice to the Company of its intention to effect such transfer. Each such notice shall describe the manner of the proposed transfer and, if requested by the Company, shall be accompanied by an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company to the effect that the proposed transfer may be effected without registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, whereupon the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to transfer such Shares in accordance with the terms of its notice; provided, however, that no such opinion of counsel shall be required for a transfer in accordance with the constituent documents of the entity to one or more partners or members, or employees of the transferor (in the case of a transferor that is a partnership or a limited liability company, respectively) or to an affiliated corporation (in the case of a transferor that is a corporation). Each certificate for the Shares transferred as above provided shall bear the legend set forth in Section 2, except that such certificate shall not bear such legend if (i) such transfer is in accordance with the provisions of Rule 144 (or any other rule permitting public sale without registration under the Securities Act) or (ii) the opinion of counsel referred to above is to the further effect that the transferee and any subsequent transferee (other than an affiliate of the Company) would be entitled to transfer such securities in a public sale without registration under the Securities Act. The restrictions provided for in this Section 3 shall not apply to securities which are not required to bear the legend prescribed by Section 2 in accordance with the provisions of that Section. 

^Required Registration. (a) At any time after the 90th day following the date hereof, the holders of Restricted Stock constituting at least [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the total shares of Restricted Stock then outstanding may request the Company to register under the Securities Act all or any portion of the shares of Restricted Stock held by such requesting holder or holders for sale in the manner specified in such notice.

^^Following receipt of any notice under this Section 4, the Company shall immediately notify all holders of Restricted Stock from whom notice has not been received and shall use its best efforts to register under the Securities Act, for public sale in accordance with the method of disposition specified in such notice from requesting holders, the number of shares of Restricted Stock specified in such notice (and in all notices received by the Company from other holders within 10 days after the giving of such notice by the Company). The Company shall be obligated to register Restricted Stock pursuant to this Section 4 on only one occasion.

\centered Registration Rights Agreement -- Page 3 

^^The Company shall be entitled to include in any registration statement referred to in this Section 4, for sale in accordance with the method of disposition specified by the requesting holders, shares of Common Stock to be sold by the Company for its own account, except as and to the extent that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter (if such method of disposition shall be an underwritten public offering), such inclusion would adversely affect the marketing of the Restricted Stock to be sold. Except for registration statements on Form S-4, S-8 or any successor thereto, the Company will not file with the Commission any other registration statement with respect to its Common Stock, whether for its own account or that of other stockholders, from the date of receipt of a notice from requesting holders pursuant to this Section 4 until the completion of the period of distribution of the registration contemplated thereby.

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, if during the ninety (90) day period following the date hereof the Company has filed a registration statement relating to an underwritten offering of its securities and has included in that registration statement the Restricted Stock, then the rights of the Investors under this Section 4 shall be suspended unless such registration statement is withdrawn or otherwise abandoned. 

^Incidental Registration. If the Company at any time (other than pursuant to Section 4 or Section 6) proposes to register any of its securities under the Securities Act for sale to the public, whether for its own account or for the account of other security holders or both (except with respect to registration statements on Forms S-4, S-8 or another form not available for registering the Restricted Stock for sale to the public), each such time it will give written notice to all holders of outstanding Restricted Stock of its intention so to do. Upon the written request of any such holder, received by the Company within 10 days after the giving of any such notice by the Company, to register any of its Restricted Stock, the Company will use its best efforts to cause the Restricted Stock as to which registration shall have been so requested to be included in the securities to be covered by the registration statement proposed to be filed by the Company, all to the extent requisite to permit the sale or other disposition by the holder of such Restricted Stock so registered. In the event that any registration pursuant to this Section 5 shall be, in whole or in part, an underwritten public offering of Common Stock, the number of shares of Restricted Stock to be included in such an underwriting may be reduced (pro rata among the requesting holders based upon the number of shares of Restricted Stock owned by such holders) if and to the extent that the managing underwriter shall be of the opinion that such inclusion would adversely affect the marketing of the securities to be sold by the Company therein, provided, however, that if any shares are to be included in such underwriting for the account of any person other than the Company or requesting holders of Restricted Stock, such number of shares of Restricted Stock shall be reduced pro rata based on the ownership of the selling stockholders that include shares in such registration of shares of Common Stock (determined on a fully-diluted basis); and provided, further, however, that in no event may less than one-third of the total number of shares of Common Stock to be included in such underwriting be made available for shares of Restricted Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company may withdraw any registration statement referred to in this Section 5 without thereby incurring any liability to the holders of Restricted Stock.

\centered Registration Rights Agreement -- Page 4 

^Registration on Form S-3. If at any time (i) a holder or holders of Restricted Stock request that the Company file a registration statement on Form S-3 or any successor thereto for a public offering of all or any portion of the shares of Restricted Stock held by such requesting holder or holders, and (ii) the Company is a registrant entitled to use Form S-3 or any successor thereto to register such shares, then the Company shall use its best efforts to register under the Securities Act on Form S-3 or any successor thereto, for public sale in accordance with the method of disposition specified in such notice, the number of shares of Restricted Stock specified in such notice. Whenever the Company is required by this Section 6 to use its best efforts to effect the registration of Restricted Stock, each of the procedures and requirements of Section 4 (including but not limited to the requirement that the Company notify all holders of Restricted Stock from whom notice has not been received and provide them with the opportunity to participate in the offering) shall apply to such registration, provided, however, the Company shall be obligated to register Restricted Stock pursuant to this Section 6 on one occasion only, and provided, further, however, that the requirements contained in the first sentence of Section 4(a) shall not apply to any registration on Form S-3 which may be requested and obtained under this Section 6.

^Registration Procedures. If and whenever the Company is required by the provisions of Sections 4, 5 or 6 to use its best efforts to effect the registration of any shares of Restricted Stock under the Securities Act, the Company will, as expeditiously as possible:

^^prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement (which, in the case of an underwritten public offering pursuant to Section 4, shall be on Form S-1 or other form of general applicability satisfactory to the managing underwriter selected as therein provided) with respect to such securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for the period of the distribution contemplated thereby (determined as hereinafter provided);

^^prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective for the period specified in paragraph (a) above and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Restricted Stock covered by such registration statement in accordance with the sellers’ intended method of disposition set forth in such registration statement for such period;

^^furnish to each seller of Restricted Stock and to each underwriter such number of copies of the registration statement and the prospectus included therein (including each preliminary prospectus) as such persons reasonably may request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Restricted Stock covered by such registration statement;

\centered Registration Rights Agreement -- Page 5 

^^use its best efforts to register or qualify the Restricted Stock covered by such registration statement under the securities or “blue sky” laws of such jurisdictions as the sellers of Restricted Stock or, in the case of an underwritten public offering, the managing underwriter reasonably shall request, provided, however, that the Company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to transact business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified or to consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

^^use its best efforts to list the Restricted Stock covered by such registration statement with any securities exchange on which the Common Stock of the Company is then listed;

^^immediately notify each seller of Restricted Stock and each underwriter under such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any event of which the Company has knowledge as a result of which the prospectus contained in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing;

^^if the offering is underwritten and at the request of any seller of Restricted Stock, use its best efforts to furnish on the date that Restricted Stock is delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to such registration: (i) an opinion dated such date of counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, addressed to the underwriters and to such seller, stating that such registration statement has become effective under the Securities Act and that (A) to the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the Securities Act, (B) the registration statement, the related prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereof comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act (except that such counsel need not express any opinion as to financial statements contained therein) and (C) to such other effects as reasonably may be requested by counsel for the underwriters or by such seller or its counsel and (ii) a letter dated such date from the independent public accountants retained by the Company, addressed to the underwriters and to such seller, stating that they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and that, in the opinion of such accountants, the financial statements of the Company included in the registration statement or the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereof, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act, and such letter shall additionally cover such other financial matters (including information as to the period ending no more than five business days prior to the date of such letter) with respect to such registration as such underwriters reasonably may request; and

^^make available for inspection by each seller of Restricted Stock, any underwriter participating in any distribution pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by such seller or underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, and cause the Company’s officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such registration statement.

\centered Registration Rights Agreement -- Page 6 

For purposes of Section 7(a) and 7(b), the period of distribution of Restricted Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering shall be deemed to extend until each underwriter has completed the distribution of all securities purchased by it, and the period of distribution of Restricted Stock in any other registration shall be deemed to extend until all of the Restricted Stock covered by such Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to such Registration Statement or all of the Restricted Stock covered by such Registration Statement may be sold without registration under Rule 144 of the 1933 Act.

In connection with each registration hereunder, the sellers of Restricted Stock will furnish to the Company in writing such information with respect to themselves and the proposed distribution by them as reasonably shall be necessary in order to assure compliance with federal and applicable state securities laws.

In connection with each registration pursuant to Sections 4, 5 or 6 covering an underwritten public offering, the Company and each seller agree to enter into a written agreement with the managing underwriter selected in the manner herein provided in such form and containing such provisions as are customary in the securities business for such an arrangement between such underwriter and companies of the Company’s size and investment stature.

^Expenses. All expenses incurred by the Company in complying with Sections 4, 5 and 6, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel and independent public accountants for the Company, fees and expenses (including counsel fees) incurred in connection with complying with state securities or “blue sky” laws, fees of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., transfer taxes, fees of transfer agents and registrars, costs of insurance, but excluding any Selling Expenses, are called “Registration Expenses”.

^Indemnification and Contribution. (a) In the event of a registration of any of the Restricted Stock under the Securities Act pursuant to Sections 4, 5 or 6, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each seller of such Restricted Stock thereunder, each underwriter of such Restricted Stock thereunder and each other person, if any, who controls such seller or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such seller, underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such Restricted Stock was registered under the Securities Act pursuant to Sections 4, 5 or 6, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such seller, each such underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by any such seller, any such underwriter or any such controlling person in writing specifically for use in such registration statement or prospectus.

\centered Registration Rights Agreement -- Page 7 

^^In the event of a registration of any of the Restricted Stock under the Securities Act pursuant to Sections 4, 5 or 6, each seller of such Restricted Stock thereunder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, each officer of the Company who signs the registration statement, each director of the Company, each underwriter and each person who controls any underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company or such officer, director, underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the registration statement under which such Restricted Stock was registered under the Securities Act pursuant to Sections 4, 5 or 6, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Company and each such officer, director, underwriter and controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, provided, however, that such seller will be liable hereunder in any such case if and only to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information pertaining to such seller, as such, furnished in writing to the Company by such seller specifically for use in such registration statement or prospectus, and provided, further, however, that the liability of each seller hereunder shall not in any event exceed the net proceeds received by such seller from the sale of Restricted Stock covered by such registration statement.

^^Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party other than under this Section 9 and shall only relieve it from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party under this Section 9 if and to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 9 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected, provided, however, that, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred.

\centered Registration Rights Agreement -- Page 8 

^^In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either (i) any holder of Restricted Stock exercising rights under this Agreement, or any controlling person of any such holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 9 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this Section 9 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any such selling holder or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this Section 9; then, and in each such case, the Company and such holder will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion so that such holder is responsible for the portion represented by the percentage that the public offering price of its Restricted Stock offered by the registration statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered by such registration statement, and the Company is responsible for the remaining portion; provided, however, that, in any such case, (A) no such holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such Restricted Stock offered by it pursuant to such registration statement; and (B) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

^Changes in Common Stock. If, and as often as, there is any change in the Common Stock by way of a stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification, or through a merger, consolidation, reorganization or recapitalization, or by any other means, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the provisions hereof so that the rights and privileges granted hereby shall continue with respect to the Common Stock as so changed.

\centered Registration Rights Agreement -- Page 9 

^Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission which may at any time permit the sale of the Restricted Stock to the public without registration, at all times after 90 days after any registration statement covering a public offering of securities of the Company under the Securities Act shall have become effective, the Company agrees to:

^^make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

^^use its best efforts to file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and
