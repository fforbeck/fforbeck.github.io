If any Proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an “**Indemnified Party**”), such Indemnified Party promptly shall promptly notify the Person from whom indemnity is sought (the “**Indemnifying Party”**) in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have proximately and materially adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; or (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such parties shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party).

^^**Contribution**. If a claim for indemnification under Section 5(a) or 5(b) is due but unavailable to an Indemnified Party because of a failure or refusal of a governmental authority to enforce such indemnification in accordance with its terms (by reason of public policy or otherwise), then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and the Indemnified Party on the other from the offering of the Preferred Stock and Warrants. If, but only if, the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the allocation of contribution shall be made in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in the foregoing sentence but also the relative fault, as applicable, of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue statement of a material fact or omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and theparties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5(c), any reasonable attorneys’ or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section was available to such party in accordance with its terms. In no event shall any selling Holder be required to contribute an amount under this Section 5(d) in excess of the gross proceeds received by such Holder upon sale of such Holder’s Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement giving rise to such contribution obligation.

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the Indemnified Parties pursuant to applicable law.

^**Rule 144**.  

As long as any Holder owns Preferred Shares, Warrants or Registrable Securities, the Company covenants to timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As long as any Holder owns Preferred Shares, Warrants or Registrable Securities, if the Company is not required to file reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, it will prepare and furnish to the Holders and make publicly available in accordance with Rule 144(c) promulgated under the Securities Act, annual and quarterly financial statements, together with a discussion and analysis of such financial statements in form and substance substantially sim ilar to those that would otherwise be required to be included in reports required by Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as well as any other information required thereby, in the time period that such filings would have been required to have been made under the Exchange Act. The Company further covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent reasonably required from time to time to enable such Person to sell Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, including providing any legal opinions relating to such sale pursuant to Rule 144. Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

^**Miscellaneous**.  

^^**Remedies**. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder of any of their obligations under this Agreement, such Holder or the Company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under thisAgreement. Each of the Company and each Holder agrees that monetary damages would not provideadequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

^^**No Inconsistent Agreements**. The Company has not entered into, and shall not enter into on or after the date of this Agreement, any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. Other than the purchasers in the private placement that closed on [[Date 3]], the Company has not previously entered into any agreement that is currently in effect granting any registration rights with respect to any of its securities to any Person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the written consent of the Holders of a majority of the then outst anding Registrable Securities, the Company shall not grant to any Person the right to request the Company to register any securities of the Company under the Securities Act unless the rights so granted are subject in all respects to the prior rights in full of the Holders set forth herein, and are not otherwise in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement.

^^**No Piggyback on Registrations for Other Securities**. Neither the Company nor any of its security holders may include securities of the Company in the Registration Statement, and the Company shall not after the date hereof enter into any agreement providing such right to any of its security holders, unless the right so granted is subject in all respects to the prior rights in full of the Holders set forth herein, and is not otherwise in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement.

^^**Piggy-Back Registrations for Registrable Securities**. If at any time when there is not an effective Registration Statement covering (i) the Conversion Shares, or (ii) Warrant Shares, the Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities Act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option or other employee benefit plans, the Company shall send to each Holder of Registrable Securities written notice of such determination and, if within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of such notice, or within such shorter period of time as may be specified by the Company in such written notice as may be necessary for the Company to comply with its obligations with respect to the timing of the filing of such registration statement, any such Holder shall so request in writing (which request shall specify the Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by the such Holder), the Company will cause the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by the Holder, to the extent requisite to permit the disposition of the Registrable Securities so to be registered, provided that if at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to such Holder and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to pay expenses in accordance with Section 4 hereof), and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any Registrable Securities being registered pursuant to this Section 7(d) for the same period as the delay in registering such other securities. The Company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities such Holder requests to be registered; **provided**, **however**, that the Co mpany shall not be required to register any Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 7(d) that are eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. In the case of an underwritten public offering, if the managing underwriter(s) or underwriter(s) should reasonably object to the inclusion of the Registrable Securities in such registration statement, then if the Company after consultation with the managing underwriter should reasonably determine that the inclusion of such Registrable Securities would materially adversely affect the offering contemplated in such registration statement, and based on such determination recommends inclusion in such registration statement of fewer or none of the Registrable Securities of the Holders, then (x) the number of Registrable Securities of the Holders included in such registration statement shall be reduced among such Holdersbased upon the number of Registrable Securities requested t o be included in the registration in the order set forth in Section 2(b) hereof, if the Company after consultation with the underwriter(s) recommends the inclusion of fewer Registrable Securities, or (y) none of the Registrable Securities of the Holders shall be included in such registration statement, if the Company after consultation with the underwriter(s) recommends the inclusion of none of such Registrable Securities; **provided**, **however**, that if securities are being offered for the account of other persons or entities as well as the Company, such reduction shall not represent a greater fraction of the number of Registrable Securities intended to be offered by the Holders than the fraction of similar reductions imposed on such other persons or entities (other than the Company). For purposes of this Section 7(d), Registrable Securities shall include any shares actually issued to the Purchasers pursuant to the Securities Escrow Agreement.

^^**Subordinated Registration Rights**. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein, the Purchasers acknowledge and agree that the registration rights so granted to the Purchasers in this Agreement are subject in all respects to the full realization of the registration rights granted to the purchasers in the private placement that closed on [[Date 3]].

^^**Failure to File Registration Statement and Other Events**. The Company and the Holders agree that the Holders will suffer damages if the Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to the Filing Date and not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the Effectiveness Date and maintained in the manner contemplated herein during the Effectiveness Period or if certain other events occur. The Company and the Holders further agree that it would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with precision. Accordingly, if (A) the Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to the Filing Date, or (B) the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the Effectiveness Date, or (C) the Company fails to file with the Commission a request for acceleration in accordance with Rule 461 promulgated under the Securities Act within three (3) Business Days of the date that the Company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the Commission that a Registration Statement will not be “reviewed,” or not subject to further review, or (D) the Registration Statement is filed with and declared effective by the Commission but thereafter ceases to be effective as to all Registrable Securities at any time prior to the expiration of the Effectiveness Period, without being succeeded immediately by a subsequent Registration Statement filed with and declared effective by the Commission in accordance with Section 2(a) hereof, or (E) the Company has breached Section 3(n) of this Agreement, or (F) trading in the Common Stock shall be suspended or if the Common Stock is no longer quoted on or is delisted from the NASDA Q (or other principal exchange on which the Common Stock is traded) for any reason for more than three (3) consecutive Business Days or twelve (12) Business Days in the aggregate for any twelve month period, (any such failure or breach being referred to as an “**Event**,” and for purposes of clauses (A) and (B) the date on which such Event occurs, or for purposes of clauses (C) and (F) the date on which such three (3) Business Day period is exceeded, or for purposes of clause (D) after more than fifteen (15) Business Days, being referred to as “**Event Date**”), then the Company shall pay an amount in cash as liquidated damages to each Holder equal to one percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the amount of the Holder’s initial investment in the Units for each calendar month or portion thereof thereafter from the Event Date until the applicable Event is cured; **provided**, **however**, that in no event shall the amount of liquidated damages payable at any time and from time to time to any Holder pursuant to this Section 7(e) exceed an aggregate of ten percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the amount of the Holder’s initial investment in the Units; and **provided**, **further**, that in the event the Commission does not permit all of the Registrable Securities to be included in the Registration Statement because of its application of Rule 415, liquidated damages payable pursuant to this Section shall only be payable by the Company based on the portion of the Holder’s initial investment in the Units that corresponds to the number of such Holder’s Registrable Securities permitted to be registered by the Commission in such Registration Statement pursu ant to Rule 415. For further clarification, the parties understand that no liquidated damages shall be payable pursuant to this Section with respect to any Registrable Securities that the Company is not permitted to include on such Registration Statement due to the Commission’s application of Rule 415. In addition, no liquidated damages shall be payable with respect to Registrable Securities that may be sold pursuant to Rule 144. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (e), if (a) any of the Events described in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) or (F) shall have occurred, (b) on or prior to the applicable Event Date, the Company shall have exercised its rights under Section 3(n) hereof and (c) the postponement or suspension permitted pursuant to such Section 3(n) shall remain effective as of such applicable Event Date, then the applicable Event Date shall be deemed instead to occur on the second Business Day following the termination of such postponement or suspension. Liquidated damages payable by the Company pursuant to this Section 7(f) shall be payable on the Event Date and the first (1st) Business Day of each thirty (30) day period following the Event Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall any liquidated damages be payable with respect to the Warrants or the Warrant Shares.
