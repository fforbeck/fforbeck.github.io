Dividend equivalent Shares represent the right to receive additional Shares and shall be credited as of the dividend payment date for Shares. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator or, if allowed, elected by a Participant, Shares shall be issued in payment and satisfaction of dividend equivalents on the date that the Equity Grants as to which such dividend equivalents accrued are paid or distributed.

^^Stock Option Exercise  
^***Partial Exercise.*** An exercisable Stock Option may be exercised in whole or in part. However, a Stock Option shall not be exercisable with respect to fractional Shares and the Administrator may require, by the terms of the applicable Award Agreement, a partial exercise to include a minimum number of Shares. 

^***Manner of Exercise***. All or a portion of an exercisable Stock Option shall be deemed exercised upon delivery to the representative of the Company designated for such purpose by the Administrator all of the following: (i) notice of exercise in such form as the Administrator authorizes specifying the number of Shares to be purchased by the Participant, (ii) payment or provision for payment of the exercise price for such number of Shares, (iii) such representations and documents as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable to effect compliance with all applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any other federal, state or foreign securities laws or regulations, and (iv) such other representations and documents as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable. Unless provided otherwise by the Administrator, no Participant shall have any right as a shareholder with respect to any Shares purchased pursuant to any Stock Option until the registration of Shares in the name of such person, and no adjustment shall be made for dividends (ordinary or extraordinary, whether in cash, securities or other property) or distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such Shares are so registered. 

^***Payment of Exercise Price.*** To the extent authorized by the Administrator, the exercise price of a Stock Option may be paid in the form of one of more of the following, either through the terms of the applicable Award Agreement or at the time of exercise of a Stock Option: (i) cash or certified or cashiers’ check, (ii) Shares that have been held by the Participant for such period of time as the Administrator may specify, (iii) other property deemed acceptable by the Administrator, (iv) a reduction in the number of Shares or other property otherwise issuable pursuant to such Stock Option, or (v) any combination of (i) through (iv). 

^^^^^ 
^^No Repricing; No Automatic Option Grants (Reloads). Without prior approval of stockholders, the Administrator may not: 

^Cancel a previously granted Stock Option in exchange for cash or a replacement Award with a lower (or no) exercise price; 

^Provide for any automatic grant of a new Stock Option upon a Participant’s exercise of any Stock Option granted under the Plan; or 

^Amend a Stock Option to lower the exercise price, except for adjustments required or otherwise made under Article 7.2, or take any other action that could constitute a repricing. 

^^Number of Shares. Subject to adjustment as provided in this Article 7, the aggregate number of Shares issued pursuant to the Plan shall not exceed an aggregate of [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of Common Stock. The aggregate number of Shares issued under the Plan at any time shall equal the number of Shares actually issued upon grant or settlement of an Award and pursuant to dividend equivalents, less any Shares retained or returned to the Company upon cash settlement, cancellation, expiration or forfeiture of an Award or from dividend equivalents and less any Shares retained by or delivered to the Company by or on behalf of a Participant (either actually or by attestation) in payment or satisfaction of any purchase price or tax obligation respecting an Award. Shares may be issued from authorized but unissued shares or out of shares held in the Company’s treasury, or both. 

^^Adjustment and Changes in Shares. If the outstanding securities of the class then subject to the Plan are increased, decreased or exchanged for or converted into cash, property or a different number or kind of shares or securities, or if cash, property or shares or securities are distributed in respect of such outstanding securities, in either case as a result of a reorganization, reclassification, dividend (other than a regular, periodic cash dividend) or other distribution, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off or the like, then the maximum number and type of shares or other securities that may be issued under the Plan and that are subject to outstanding Awards (including awards of Common Stock the receipt of which has been deferred) shall be appropriately adjusted. The Administrator shall determine in its sole discretion the appropriate adjustment to be effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and in doing so shall take into account the provisions of any applicable Award Agreement. In addition, in connection with any such change in the class of securities then subject to the Plan, the Administrator shall make equitable adjustments in the number and type of shares or other securities or cash or other property that may be acquired pursuant to stock options and stock grants theretofore awarded under the Plan and the exercise price of such stock options or price, if any, of such stock grants; however no adjustment to an option shall be made in a manner that will be treated under Code Section 409A as the grant of a new option. 

^^^^^ 
Unless earlier suspended or terminated by the Board, no Award may be initially awarded after the tenth anniversary of the date the Plan is approved by the Company’s shareholders. 

^^Amendment and Termination. The Board may from time to time amend the Plan; provided, however, that no amendment may without shareholder approval (a) materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the Plan, (b) materially increase the number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan, or (c) materially modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan. In addition, except for an amendment adopted pursuant to Section 9.6, no amendment or alteration to the Plan shall be made which would in any material manner adversely affect any Participant’s rights to any Award or Shares theretofore accrued or granted to him or her hereunder, without the consent of the Participant. 

^^Compliance with Securities Laws, Listing Requirements, and Other Laws and Obligations. The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock under the Plan, (a) until, in the opinion of the Company’s counsel, all applicable federal and state laws and regulations have been complied with, (b) if the outstanding Common Stock is at the time listed on any stock exchange, or quoted on any automated quotation system, until the shares to be delivered have been listed or authorized to be listed or quoted on such exchange or system upon official notice of issuance, and (c) until all other legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of such shares have been approved by the Company’s counsel. If the sale of Common Stock has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Company may require, as a condition to the payment of Common Stock, such representations or agreements as counsel for the Company may consider appropriate to avoid violation of such Act and may require that the certificates evidencing such Stock bear an appropriate legend restricting transfer. In addition, the Company may, in its discretion, withhold a portion of the Shares that otherwise would be issued under the Plan to a Participant or make other such arrangements as it determines appropriate to satisfy Federal, state and local withholding tax requirements, if any. 

^^Successors. All obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. 

^^Applicable Law. The Plan shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to Delaware conflict of laws rules, to the extent not preempted by federal law, which shall otherwise control. 

^^^^^ 
^^Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 

^^Compliance with Code Section 409A. To the extent that a benefit under the Plan is subject to the requirements of Code Section 409A, it is intended that the Plan, as applied to that benefit, comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, and the Plan shall be so administered and interpreted. The Administrator may make any changes required to conform the Plan and any option agreements or other grants with applicable Code provisions and regulations relating to deferral of compensation under Code Section 409A.
