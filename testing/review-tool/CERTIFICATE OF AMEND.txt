^^^The rate or amount and times at which, and the preferences and conditions under which, dividends shall be payable on shares of such series, the status of such dividends as cumulative or noncumulative, the date or dates from which dividends, if cumulative, shall accumulate, and the status of such shares as participating or nonparticipating after the payment of dividends as to which such shares are entitled to any preference;

^^^The rights and preferences, if any, of the shareholders of such series upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the Company, which amount may vary depending upon whether such liquidation, dissolution or winding up is voluntary or involuntary and, if voluntary, may vary at different dates, and the status of the shares of such series as participating or nonparticipating after the satisfaction of any such rights and preferences;

The foregoing amendment to the Articles of Incorporation was duly authorized by the written consent of a majority of the shareholders of the Company, pursuant to the Colorado Business Corporation Act.

The vote by which the stockholders holding shares in the Company entitling them to exercise at least a majority of the voting power, or such greater proportion of the voting power as may be required in the case of a vote by classes or series or as may be required by the provisions of the Articles have voted in favor of the amendment exceeds the majority of voting power.

The undersigned Chief Executive Officer of the Company hereby declares that the foregoing Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this certificate has been executed by the undersigned on [[Date 2: Date]], effective immediately upon proper filing with the State of Colorado.
