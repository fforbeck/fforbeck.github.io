To the extent number of Qualified Subscribers as of the Closing Date exceeds 523, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the number of Qualified Subscribers greater than 523 multiplied by the Individual Qualified Subscriber Value. However, to the extent the number of Qualified Subscribers as of the Closing Date is less than 523, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the number of Qualified Subscribers multiplied by the Individual Qualified Subscriber Value. The Total Qualified Subscriber Value shall then be adjusted by the Purchase Price Adjustment as provided in Section 3.2, which final amount shall constitute the “Purchase Price”. The Purchase Price shall be paid in the following manner: 

^^Buyer shall pay to Seller, in cash at Closing the amount of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 3: Number]]), provided that the amount of cash at Closing shall increase or decrease, if applicable, as determined by the Purchase Price Adjustments described in Section 3.2 (the “Closing Cash Payment”); and

^^Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 4: Number]])in common stock of the Buyer at Closing, with the price per share determined by a 30-day Volume Weighted Average Price Per Share (“VWAP Per Share”), ending with the day prior to any announcement of the transaction; and

^^Buyer and Seller shall determine the Purchase Price, including all Purchase Price Adjustments arising under Section 3.2 and all proration adjustments pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent known or then subject to calculation, on the Closing Date, which estimate shall be provided by Seller to Buyer for Buyer’s review and approval no later than two business days prior to the Closing Date; to the extent such Purchase Price Adjustments and the following items: a) executed site leases for existing sites without written agreements, b) Required Consents, and c) all requested internet protocol address information, (collectively defined as “Closing Cash Payment Deliverables,”) are not provided two business days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall withhold thirty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the Closing Cash Payment until such Purchase Price Adjustments are calculated and Closing Cash Payment Deliverables are provided to Buyer for Buyer’s review and approval, upon such review and approval, Buyer shall then pay the balance of the Closing Cash Payment as applicable; and

^^Beginning ninety days after the Closing Date, or if the Closing Date does not fall on the last day of the month, ninety days from the last day of the month in which the Closing Date occurs, the Buyer shall make seven consecutive quarterly payments of Eighteen Thousand and Seven Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($[[USD Value 5: Number]]) to the Seller and an eighth and final payment in the amount of Forty Three Thousand and Seven Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($[[USD Value 6: Number]]) (the “Post-Closing Payments”). For the sake of clarity, the Post Closing Payments are described in Schedule 3.1(d) attached hereto.

^^Purchase Price Adjustments. The Purchase Price is subject to adjustment as follows (the “Purchase Price Adjustments”):

^^To the extent there is a Net Working Capital Deficit as of the Closing Date, the Closing Payment shall be reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis, for every dollar of Net Working Capital Deficit at Closing;

^^To the extent there is a Net Working Capital Credit as of the Closing Date, the Closing Payment shall be increased, on a dollar for dollar basis, for every dollar of Net Working Capital Credit at Closing; and

^^The Purchase Price shall be decreased, on a dollar for dollar basis, by the amount of principal and interest assumed by the Buyer, if any.

^^The Closing Cash Payment shall be increased, in the amount of $[[USD Value 7: Number]] provided that the Seller and that certain hosting and bandwidth customer executes an agreement with a term of at least one year and a copy of such agreement is provided to Buyer at or prior to the Closing Date.

^^Right of Off-Set. In the event of a breach by Seller of any of the representations and warranties described in Article 4 or Section 6.12 that result in compensatory damages to Buyer, Buyer shall be entitled to make a deduction or off-set in that amount to any of the Post Closing Payments, if and when discovered by Buyer. However, prior to making such off-set, Buyer shall provide to Seller evidence in writing of monetary damages, prior to any deduction. For the sake of clarity, the Right of Off-Set shall apply to actual, out-of-pocket costs borne by Buyer for items such as equipment replacement, *excluding* ordinary wear and tear, tax liabilities, or other costs directly related to a breach of Article 4. In the event that Seller disputes such amounts, Buyer and Seller shall submit to binding arbitration in Champaign County, Illinois for a final determination.
