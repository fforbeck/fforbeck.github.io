^^Each such grant or sale will provide that during the period for which such substantial risk of forfeiture is to continue, the transferability of the Restricted Stock will be prohibited or restricted in the manner and to the extent prescribed by the Board at the Date of Grant (which restrictions may include, without limitation, rights of repurchase or first refusal in the Company or provisions subjecting the Restricted Stock to a continuing substantial risk of forfeiture in the hands of any transferee).

^^Any such grant or sale may specify Management Objectives that, if achieved, will result in termination or early termination of the restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock. Each grant or sale may specify in respect of such Management Objectives a minimum acceptable level of achievement and may set forth a formula for determining the number of shares of Restricted Stock on which restrictions will terminate if performance is at or above the minimum level, but falls short of full achievement of the specified Management Objectives. Such grant or sale will specify that, before the Restricted Stock will be earned and paid, the Board must certify that the Management Objec tives have been satisfied.

^^Any such grant or sale may require that any or all dividends or other distributions paid thereon during the period of such restrictions be automatically deferred and reinvested in additional shares of Restricted Stock, which may be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying award.

^^Each grant or sale will be evidenced by an Evidence of Award and will contain such terms and provisions, consistent with this Plan, as the Board may approve.

Such payment will be made (i) in cash or by check acceptable to the Company or by wire transfer of immediately available funds, (ii) by the actual or constructive transfer to the Company of Common Shares owned by the Non-Employee Director for at least six (6) months (or such shorter period as may be possible without triggering negative accounting treatment) (or other consideration authorized pursuant to Section 9(b)) having a value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option Price, (iii) any other legal consideration that the Board may deem appropriate on such basis as the Board may determine in accordance with this Plan, or (iv) by a combination of such methods of payment. No fractional Common Shares will be issued or accepted.

^^To the extent permitted by law, any grant may provide for deferred payment of the Option Price from the proceeds of sale through a bank or broker on a date satisfactory to the Company of some or all of the Common Shares to which such exercise relates.

^^Each grant or sale of Appreciation Rights pursuant to this Section 9 will be upon terms and conditions consistent with Section 5 of this Plan.

^^Each grant or sale of Restricted Stock pursuant to this Section 9 will be upon terms and conditions consistent with Section 6 of this Plan.

^^Each grant or sale of Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Section 9 will be upon terms and conditions consistent with Section 7 of this Plan.

^^Non-Employee Directors may be granted, sold, or awarded other awards as contemplated by Section 10 of this Plan.

^^Non-Employee Directors, pursuant to this Section 9, may be awarded, or may be permitted to elect to receive, pursuant to procedures established by the Board, all or any portion of their annual retainer, meeting fees or other fees in Common Shares in lieu of cash.

^**Other Awards.**  
^^The Board may, subject to limitations under applicable law, grant to any Participant such other awards that may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, or related to, Common Shares or factors that may influence the value of such Common Shares, including, without limitation, convertible or exchangeable debt securities, other rights convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares, purchase rights for Common Shares, awards with value and payment contingent upon performance of the Company or specified Subsidiaries, affiliates or other business units thereof or any other factors designated by the Board, and awards valued by reference to the book value of Common Shares or the value of securities of, or the performance of specified Subsidiaries or affiliates or other business units of the Company. The Board shall determine the terms and conditions of such awards. Common Shares delivered pursuant to an award in the nature of a purchase right granted under this Section 10 shall be purchased for such consideration, paid for at such time, by such methods, and in such forms, including, without limitation, cash, Common Shares, other awards, notes or other property, as the Board shall determine.

^^Cash awards, as an element of or supplement to any other award granted under this Plan, may also be granted pursuant to this Section 10 of this Plan.

^^The Board may grant Common Shares as a bonus, or may grant other awards in lieu of obligations of the Company or a Subsidiary to pay cash or deliver other property under this Plan or under other plans or compensatory arrangements, subject to such terms as shall be determined by the Board.

^Transferability.   
^^Except as provided in Section 11(b) and 11(c) below, no Option Right, Appreciation Right or other derivative security granted under this Plan shall be transferable by the Participant except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, except with respect to an Incentive Stock Option, pursuant to a domestic relations order (within the meaning of Rule 16a-12 promulgated under the Exchange Act). Except as otherwise determined by the Board, Option Rights and Appreciation Rights will be exercisable during the Participant’s lifetime only by him or her or, in the event of the Participant’s legal incapacity to do so, by his or her guardian or legal representative acting on behalf of the Participant in a fiduciary capacity under state law and/or cou rt supervision.

^^Notwithstanding Section 11(a) above, an Option Right, Appreciation Right or other derivative security granted under this Plan may be transferable upon the death of the Participant, without payment of consideration therefor, to any one or more family members (as defined in the General Instructions to Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933) of the Participant, as may have been designated in writing by the Participant by means of a form of beneficiary designation approved by the Company. Such beneficiary designation may be made at any time by the Participant and shall be effective when it is filed, prior to the death of the Participant, with the Company. Any beneficiary designation may be changed by the filing of a new beneficiary designation, whic h will cancel any beneficiary designation previously filed with the Company.

^^Notwithstanding Section 11(a) above, an Option Right (except with respect to an Incentive Stock Option), Appreciation Right or other derivative security granted under this Plan may be transferable by the Participant without payment of consideration therefor, to any one or more family members (as defined in the General Instructions to Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933) of the Participant; **provided**, **however**, that such transfer will not be effective until notice of such transfer is delivered to the Company; and **provided**, further, **however**, that any such transferee is subject to the same terms and conditions hereunder as the Participant.

^^The Board may specify at the Date of Grant that part or all of the Common Shares that are (i) to be issued or transferred by the Company upon the exercise of Option Rights or Appreciation Rights, upon the termination of the Restriction Period applicable to Restricted Stock Units or upon payment under any grant of Performance Shares or Performance Units or (ii) no longer subject to the substantial risk of forfeiture and restrictions on transfer referred to in Section 6 of this Plan, will be subject to further restrictions on transfer.

^**Adjustments.**  
^^The Board may make or provide for such adjustments in the numbers of Common Shares covered by outstanding Option Rights, Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Shares granted hereunder and, if applicable, in the number of Common Shares covered by other awards granted pursuant to Section 10 hereof, in the Option Price and Base Price provided in outstanding Appreciation Rights, and in the kind of shares covered thereby, as the Board, in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith, may determine is equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants or Optionees that otherwise would result from (a) any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the Company, or (b) any merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other distribution of assets, issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of the foregoing.   

^^Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event specified in Section 12(a) above, the Board, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding awards under this Plan such alternative consideration as it, in good faith, may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection therewith the surrender of all awards so replaced. In the event of any such transaction or event specified in Section 12(a) above, the Board, in its discretion, may also provide for the assumption by another corporation of any or all outstanding awards under this Plan.

^^The Board may also make or provide for such adjustments in the numbers of shares specified in Section 3 of this Plan as the Board in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith, may determine is appropriate to reflect any transaction or event described in this Section 12; **provided**, **however**, that any such adjustment to the number specified in Section 3(b)(i) will be made only if and to the extent that such adjustment would not cause any Option intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option to fail so to qualify.

^**Change in Control.**  
^^For purposes of this Plan, except as may be otherwise prescribed by the Board in an Evidence of Award, a “Change in Control” will mean if at any time any of the following events will have occurred:

^^^the Company is merged or consolidated or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal person, and as a result of such merger, consolidation or reorganization [[Percentage 2: Number]]% or less of the combined voting power of the Voting Stock of such corporation or person immediately after such transaction is held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such transaction;

^^^the Company sells or otherwise transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation or legal person, and as a result of such sale or transfer, [[Percentage 2]]% or less of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding Voting Stock of such corporation or person immediately after such sale or transfer is held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such sale or transfer;

^^^the acquisition by any Person of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of [[Percentage 3: Number]]% or more of the combined voting power of the Voting Stock then outstanding after giving effect to such acquisition; or

^^^individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease, for any reason, to constitute at least a majority of the Board; **provided**, **however**, that any individual becoming a Director subsequent to the date hereof whose election or nomination for election by the Company’s shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Directors then comprising the Incumbent Board (either by a specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the Company in which such person is named as a nominee for Director, without objection to such nomination) shall be deemed to be or have been a member of the Incumbent Board;

**provided**, **however**, notwithstanding the Section l3(a)(iii) above, unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a “Change in Control” shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of Section 13(a)(iii) solely because (A) the Company, (B) a Subsidiary, or (C) any Company-sponsored employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary, either files or becomes obligated to file a report or proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D or Schedule 14D-1 (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in exces s of [[Percentage 3]]% or otherwise.

^^In the event of a Change in Control affecting the Company, then, notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, unless otherwise expressly determined in an Evidence of Award entered into between the Company and any Participant, all awards that have not expired and which are then held by any Participant (or the person or persons to whom any deceased Participant’s rights have been transferred) shall, as of such Change in Control, become fully and immediately vested and, with respect to Option Rights, exercisable and may be exercised for the remaining term of the Option Right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no acceleration shall occur with respect to Restricted Stock Units or other awards to the extent they are subject to Section 409A of the C ode unless the events that have occurred would also constitute a “Change in the Ownership or Effective Control of a Corporation or in the Ownership of a Substantial Portion of the Assets of a Corporation” under Treasury Department Final Regulation 1.409A-3(j)(5), or any successor thereto.

^**Fractional Shares.** The Company will not be required to issue any fractional Common Shares pursuant to this Plan. The Board may provide for the elimination of fractions or for the settlement of fractions in cash.

^**Withholding Taxes.** To the extent that the Company is required to withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any payment made or benefit realized by a Participant or other person under this Plan, and the amounts available to the Company for such withholding are insufficient, it will be a condition to the receipt of such payment or the realization of such benefit that the Participant or such other person make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of the balance of such taxes required to be withheld, which arrangements (in the discretion of the Board) may include relinquishment of a portion of such benefit.

^**Foreign Employees.** In order to facilitate the making of any grant or combination of grants under this Plan, the Board may provide for such special terms for awards to Participants who are foreign nationals or who are employed by the Company or any Subsidiary outside of the United States of America or who provide services to the Company under an agreement with a foreign nation or agency, as the Board may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom. Moreover, the Board may approve such supplements to or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of this Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes, without thereby af fecting the terms of this Plan as in effect for any other purpose, and the Secretary or other appropriate officer of the Company may certify any such document as having been approved and adopted in the same manner as this Plan. No such special terms, supplements, amendments or restatements, however, will include any provisions that are inconsistent with the terms of this Plan as then in effect unless this Plan could have been amended to eliminate such inconsistency without further approval by the shareholders of the Company.

^**Administration of the Plan.**  
^^This Plan will be administered by the Board, which may from time to time delegate all or any part of its authority under this Plan to the compensation committee of the Board (or committee or a subcommittee consisting exclusively of not less than two or more members of the Board, each of whom shall be a “non-employee director” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated under the Exchange Act, an “outside director” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and an “independent director” within the meaning of the rules of the New York Stock Exchange), as constituted from time to time. To the extent of any such delegation, references in this Plan to the Board will be deemed to b e references to such committee or subcommittee. A majority of the committee (or subcommittee) will constitute a quorum, and the action of the members of the committee (or subcommittee) present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, or acts unanimously approved in writing, will be the acts of the committee (or subcommittee).

^^To the extent of any delegation by the Board of its authority to administer the Plan to the committee (or subcommittee), as set forth in Section 17(a) of this Plan, such committee (or subcommittee) shall have full discretionary authority in all matters relating to the discharge of its responsibilities under this Plan, including, without limitation, its exercise of negative discretion in determining the size of an award if the Management Objective has been achieved, if in the committee’s (or subcommittee’s) sole judgment, such application is appropriate in order to act in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The interpretation and construction by the Board of any provision of this Plan or of any Evidence of Award, and any determi nation by the Board pursuant to any provision of this Plan or of any such Evidence of Award, shall be final and conclusive. No member of the Board will be liable for any such action or determination made in good faith.

^^The Board or, to the extent of any delegation as provided in Section 17(a), the committee, may delegate to one or more of its members or to one or more officers of the Company, or to one or more agents or advisors, such administrative duties or powers as it may deem advisable, and the Board, the committee, or any person to whom duties or powers have been delegated as aforesaid, may employ one or more persons to render advice with respect to any responsibility the Board, the committee or such person may have under this Plan. The Board or the committee may, by resolution, authorize one or more officers of the Company to do one or both of the following on the same basis as the Bo ard or the committee: (i) designate employees to be recipients of awards under this Plan; and (b) determine the size of any such awards; **provided**, **however**, that (A) the Board or the committee shall not delegate such responsibilities to any such officer for awards granted to an employee who is an officer, Director, or more than [[Percentage 1]]% beneficial owner of any class of the Company’s equity securities that is registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, as determined by the Board in accordance with Section 16 of the Exchange Act; (B) the resolution providing for such authorization sets forth the total number of Common Shares such officer(s) may grant; and (iii) the officer(s) shall report periodically to the Board or the committee, as the case may be, regarding the nature and scope of the awards granted pursuant to the authority delegated.

^**Amendments, Etc.**  
^^The Board may at any time and from time to time amend this Plan in whole or in part; **provided**, **however**, that any amendment which must be approved by the shareholders of the Company in order to comply with applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Common Shares are not traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the principal national securities exchange upon which the Common Shares are traded or quoted, will not be effective unless and until such approval has been obtained.

^^The Board will not, without the further approval of the shareholders of the Company, authorize the amendment of any outstanding Option Right to reduce the Option Price. Furthermore, no Option Right will be cancelled and replaced with awards having a lower Option Price without further approval of the shareholders of the Company. This Section 18(b) is intended to prohibit the repricing of “underwater” Option Rights and will not be construed to prohibit the adjustments provided for in Section 12 of this Plan.

^^The Board also may permit Participants to elect to defer the issuance of Common Shares or the settlement of awards in cash under this Plan pursuant to such rules, procedures or programs as it may establish for purposes of this Plan. The Board also may provide that deferred issuances and settlements include the payment or crediting of dividend equivalents or interest on the deferral amounts.

^^The Board may condition the grant of any award or combination of awards authorized under this Plan on the surrender or deferral by the Participant of his or her right to receive a cash bonus or other compensation otherwise payable by the Company or a Subsidiary to the Participant.

^^In case of termination of employment by reason of death, Disability or normal or early retirement, or in the case of hardship or other special circumstances, of a Participant who holds an Option Right or Appreciation Right not immediately exercisable in full, or any shares of Restricted Stock as to which the substantial risk of forfeiture or the prohibition or restriction on transfer has not lapsed, or any Restricted Stock Units as to which the Restriction Period has not been completed, or any Performance Shares or Performance Units which have not been fully earned, or any other awards made pursuant to Section 10 subject to any vesting schedule or transfer restriction, or who holds Commo n Shares subject to any transfer restriction imposed pursuant to Section 11(b) of this Plan, the Board may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the time at which such Option Right, Appreciation Right or other award may be exercised or the time at which such substantial risk of forfeiture or prohibition or restriction on transfer will lapse or the time when such Restriction Period will end or the time at which such Performance Shares or Performance Units will be deemed to have been fully earned or the time when such transfer restriction will terminate or may waive any other limitation or requirement under any such award, except to the extent, with respect to awards subject to Section 409A of the Code, such acceleration would result in a violation of Section 409A of the Code.

^^This Plan will not confer upon any Participant any right with respect to continuance of employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary, nor will it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have to terminate such Participant’s employment or other service at any time.

^^To the extent that any provision of this Plan would prevent any Option Right that was intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option from qualifying as such, that provision will be null and void with respect to such Option Right. Such provision, however, will remain in effect for other Option Rights and there will be no further effect on any provision of this Plan.

^^The Board may amend the terms of any award theretofore granted under this Plan prospectively or retroactively, but subject to Section 12 above no such amendment shall impair the rights of any holder without his or her consent. The Board may, in its discretion, terminate this Plan at any time. Termination of this Plan will not affect the rights of Participants or their successors under any awards outstanding hereunder and not exercised in full on the date of termination.

^**Detrimental Activity.** Any Evidence of Award may provide that if a Participant, either during employment by the Company or a Subsidiary or within a specified period after termination of such employment, shall engage in any Detrimental Activity, and the Board shall so find, forthwith upon notice of such finding, the Participant shall:

^^Return to the Company, in exchange for payment by the Company of any amount actually paid therefor by the Participant, all Common Shares that the Participant has not disposed of that were offered pursuant to this Plan within a specified period prior to the date of the commencement of such Detrimental Activity, and

^^With respect to any Common Shares so acquired that the Participant has disposed of, pay to the Company in cash the difference between:

^^^The Market Value Per Share of the Common Shares on the date of such acquisition, and

^^^Any amount actually paid therefor by the Participant pursuant to this Plan.

To the extent that such amounts are not paid to the Company, the Company may set off the amounts so payable to it against any amounts that may be owing from time to time by the Company or a Subsidiary to the Participant, whether as wages, deferred compensation or vacation pay or in the form of any other benefit or for any other reason.

^**Governing Law.** This Plan and all grants and awards and actions taken thereunder shall he governed by and construed in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware.

^**Termination.** No grant will be made under this Plan more than 10 years after the date on which this Plan is first approved by the shareholders of the Company, but all grants made on or prior to such date will continue in effect thereafter subject to the terms thereof and of this Plan.

^**Compliance with Section 409A of the Code; Awards to Specified Employees.** This Plan is intended to comply and shall be administered in a manner that is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. To the extent that an award, issuance and/or payment is subject to Section 409A of the Code, it shall be awarded and/or issued or paid in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including proposed, temporary or final regulations or any other guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service with respect thereto (the “Guidance”). Notwithstanding anything her ein or in any grant agreement or other documentation related to an award to the contrary, to the extent that any award subject to Section 409A is payable in connection with the Participant’s separation from service and at the time of the separation from service the Participant is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A(2)(B) of the Code) then such payment shall be made on the first business day of the first calendar month that begins after the six-month anniversary of the separation from service or, if earlier, on the date of the Participant’s death. Any provision of this Plan that would cause an award, issuance and/or payment to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code shall have no force and effect until amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by the Guidance).

^**General Provisions.**  
^^No award under this Plan may be exercised by the holder thereof if such exercise, and the receipt of cash or stock thereunder, would be, in the opinion of counsel selected by the Board, contrary to law or the regulations of any duly constituted authority having jurisdiction over this Plan.

^^Absence on leave approved by a duly constituted officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall not be considered interruption or termination of service of any employee for any purposes of this Plan or awards granted hereunder, except with respect to awards subject to Section 409A of the Code, and to the extent the absence or leave would be considered a separation from service pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. No awards may be granted to an employee while he or she is absent on leave.

^^No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any Common Shares subject to awards granted to him or her under this Plan prior to the date as of which he or she is actually recorded as the holder of such shares upon the stock records of the Company.
