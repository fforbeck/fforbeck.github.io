      To stimulate these employees to use their innate creativity and entrepreneurial thinking in carrying out the responsibilities of their present assignments.

      To enhance the business growth and profitability of Koppers Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) by providing those charged with leadership roles with an opportunity for additional compensation based upon their contributions to the achievement of the business goals of the Company.

      For purposes of this plan, Plan Year shall mean a calendar year during which the Plan is in effect.

**Incentive Plan Goals:**

**Incentive Plan Threshold Events:** 

      Any payments under this incentive plan will be subject to the Company’s compliance with its debt covenants, including interest obligations and scheduled repayment of debt.

      The participant’s job performance during the period in question must meet acceptable standards and be in accordance with Company policy.

      Notwithstanding anything in this incentive plan to the contrary, the decision to make any payments under this incentive plan and the amount of such payments will be subject to the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”), Management Development & Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) and/or Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company.

      Unless otherwise approved by the Committee or the Board, gains and losses arising from non-recurring and non-operating transactions (such as, but not limited to, restructuring charges/reversals, impact of lawsuit outcomes, unbudgeted sales/divestitures and changes in accounting rules) will be excluded from calculations of EPS and Value Creation under this Plan.

**Incentive Funding:** 

The following measures will be rewarded under the Plan: 

      *EPS ([[Percentage 1: Number]]% weighting)*: Basic earnings per share calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles, subject to any adjustments approved by the Committee or the Board.

      *Value Creation ([[Percentage 2: Number]]% weighting)*: Calculated as EBIT minus (a capital charge of [[Percentage 3: Number]]% times the amount of capital committed to the respective unit or corporation) subject to any adjustments approved by the Committee or the Board.

      Calculated at the total corporate level

For each measure identified above, a threshold, target and maximum will be established for each Plan Year. Achievement of the threshold performance will result in the threshold payout being contributed to the incentive pool (awards for performance between the threshold and the target are determined by interpolation). Achievement of the target performance will result in the target payout being contributed to the incentive pool. Achievement of the maximum performance will result the maximum payout being contributed to the incentive pool (awards for performance between target and maximum are determined by interpolation).
