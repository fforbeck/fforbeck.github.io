**NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

The term of this Agreement (the **“Term”**) shall commence on the Effective Date and shall expire on the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Effective Date, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms herein. For the orderly servicing of the FQ 

\centered **Confidential Treatment Requested**

Such assistance (the **“Transfer Services”** as defined in Exhibit A) shall be for a period of six (6) months (the **“Transfer Period”**). Except in the cases of Breach (defined below), in the event that FundQuest is unable to conduct such transfer to a new service provider within this six (6) month period, the parties agree to extend the Transfer Period for a reasonable period of time, as agreed upon by the parties; provided, however, that FundQuest is proceeding in good faith.

\centered **Confidential Treatment Requested** 

^^^The parties agree that, from time to time during the Term, FundQuest may request, or Envestnet may propose, that Envestnet implement a change to the Platform Services (each, a **“Platform Change”**). For the avoidance of doubt, a Platform Change shall be any change to the Platform Services by Envestnet which is not currently covered by this Agreement and which has not previously been agreed by FundQuest and Envestnet. A Platform Change may require an increase or decrease in the fees and expenses and/or an increase or decrease in the work Envestnet is to perform or services Envestnet is to provide, including, without limitation: (a) a change to the scope or functionality of the Platform Services, such as a Platform feature enhancement; (b) the addition of a new program option to the Platform Services; (c) a material change in the prioritization or manner in which Envestnet is performing the Platform Services that causes an increase in cost or development work. For any Platform Changes, the parties shall enter into an addendum to this Agreement specifying the Platform Changes and pricing agreed upon by the parties. Such pricing shall be in line with current market practice. Nothing herein shall require a party to adopt a Platform Change without written addendum signed by both parties. In the event that FundQuest decides not to adopt a Platform Change, Envestnet shall continue providing the same level of Platform Services which has been agreed to with FundQuest and as specified herein.

^^^In addition, the parties acknowledge and agree that the occurrence of the following events may require a modification to the Platform Services and/or an increase in time or performance, suspension of any performance standards (each, an **“Adjustment Event”**), including applicable service levels, and/or an increase or decrease in the fees and expenses: (a) a material change to or deficiency in the information that one party has supplied to the other party; (b) a failure by one party and/or any of its third party providers to perform any of their respective responsibilities under this Agreement in a timely manner; (c) an event that materially changes the service needs or requirements of FundQuest on or after the Effective Date; (d) circumstances beyond the reasonable control of either of the parties, including acts of God or other Force Majeure Events (as defined herein); (e) a change in applicable law or government regulation; or (f) any assumption described in Exhibit A not being fully realized. Any Adjustment Event, and its impact to this Agreement, must be agreed in writing by both parties as an addendum to this Agreement.

In asserting an Adjustment Event: (i) the party claiming such event must clearly identify the impact of the Adjustment Event on the increase/decrease of services each party performs in relation to the cost of providing such services; and (ii) such event must have materially changed the cost burden of the party

\centered **Confidential Treatment Requested** 

claiming an Adjustment Event and cannot be based on cost saving measures of the other party that do not result in a material change to the terms specified herein.

^General Assumptions for Platform Services. The terms set forth in this Agreement are based upon information furnished by FundQuest to Envestnet. FundQuest represents that it believes to the best of its knowledge that such information is accurate and complete. However, if any such information should prove to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect at any time, this Agreement shall be subject to equitable adjustments, including the fees set forth herein. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to ensure that the pricing is adjusted accordingly.

\centered **Confidential Treatment Requested** 

of notice of the commencement of any action, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the other party (**“indemnifying party”**), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof as soon as practicable after the summons or other first written notification giving information of the nature of the claim has been served upon the indemnified party; provided that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability under this section, except to the extent that the omission results in a failure of actual notice to the indemnifying party and such indemnifying party is damaged solely as a result of the failure to give such notice. The indemnifying party, upon the request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party in the proceeding, and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (1) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (2) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.

^Termination for Force Majeure. If Envestnet is excused under Section 11(P) from performance of its obligations representing a system failure where a major function of the platform is non-operational with no reasonably acceptable work around for a continuous period in excess of fifteen (15) days, then FundQuest may terminate this Agreement immediately on service of written notice, without penalty or liability. Termination under this Section 8(C) shall not represent a Breach by either party.

^Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement or the expiration of the Term, Envestnet shall provide to FundQuest reasonable termination assistance requested by FundQuest, as described in Exhibit A (including, without limitation, Transfer Services) to facilitate the orderly transfer of responsibility under this Agreement to FundQuest or its designee.

On a periodic basis, at least annually, FundQuest and Envestnet agree to review the Service Level Agreements and revise them as necessary due to regulatory, commercial, industry, technical or other changes. FundQuest and Envestnet agree to define these Service Level Agreements in the spirit of processing investment activities and services in an accurate and timely manner, and consistent with services provided on the FQ Legacy Platform to the extent practicable. 

^^^Envestnet will work with FundQuest to define a Quarterly SLA report, once defined beginning in the first full calendar quarter following the conversion, Envestnet will collect and compile data for the agreed upon metrics. In the month following the end of each full calendar quarter, Envestnet shall deliver to FundQuest a report, the “**Quarterly SLA Report**,” that sets forth Envestnet’s actual performance against the agreed upon metrics. 

^^^In the event Envestnet’s actual performance with respect to any Service Process has not been met, a “**Performance Shortfall**,” Envestnet shall accompany the Quarterly SLA Report with a written corrective plan, “**Performance Improvement Plan**” explaining the causes of the Performance Shortfall and the remedial actions that shall be taken to improve performance. In the event the remedial actions are not effective in resolving the Performance Shortfall for two consecutive quarters following the quarter in which the initial Performance Shortfall occurred FundQuest may consider the Performance Shortfall as a material failure to fulfill Envestnet’s obligations. 

\centered **Confidential Treatment Requested** 

^^^In calculating Envestnet’s conformance with the Service Level Agreements, Envestnet will be excused from meeting a Service Level Agreement in instances where: (1) any other party has caused delays by submitting information outside of the agreed-upon timeframes; (2) performance within the stated standard is rendered impossible due to a failure to perform by a third party (including account being NIGO); (3) circumstances or events arise that constitute Force Majeure; or (4) a Disaster Recovery event has occurred. 

^System Availability. 

^^^The Envestnet system shall be Available not less than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of Scheduled Hours (calculated on a monthly basis): 

“**Scheduled Hours**” means 24 hours, 7 days a week, exclusive of scheduled maintenance outages (short intervals that vary depending on number/severity of patches required). For quarterly scheduled maintenance Envestnet will notify FundQuest reasonably in advance. 

“**Available**” means that FundQuest, FQ Client, IRA and/or Program Account Owners during Scheduled Hours are able to log-in, navigate and utilize the web-site, from initial point of access at log-in page through log-out (unless the access problem is due/attributed to malfunctions, deficiencies, problems or issues at an a non-Envestnet network problem, end user workstation, or in a system or medium not operated by and beyond the reasonable control of Envestnet). 

^System Functionality. 

^^Major function: A platform function that is necessary for a financial advisor or a home-office administrator to support the activities of proposal generation and account management. Examples include the ability to create an investment proposal, trade an advisor-directed model, or access core performance reports. 

^^^Minor function: Any non-major function. Work-around: An alternate approach to operating the software that does not require a significant number of additional steps. 

^Severity Levels. 

The following severity levels are used for determining patch procedures: 

Severity Level 1: 

^system failure where any major function of the platform in non-operational and there is no known work-around. A problem with this severity requires immediate attention and will be patched immediately as soon as a fix can be determined. 

\centered **Confidential Treatment Requested** 

Severity Level 2: 

^system failure that results in a) a major function of the platform to no longer operate as designed but a “work-around” exists, b) a minor function of the platform to no longer operate as designed and no “work-around” exists, or c) a significant degradation in performance. A problem of this severity requires prompt attention (within two hours of discovery), and will be patched after normal business hours as soon as a fix is determined. 

Severity Level 3: 

^system failure that results in a) a minor function of the platform to no longer operate as designed and a “work-around” exists, b) slightly degraded performance, c) the display of incomplete results, or d) the display of inaccurate but not potentially damaging results. A problem of this severity will be corrected in the next regularly scheduled release. In some cases, a problem of this severity will be patched after normal business hours if a fix is determined that can be safely applied with no risk to any other function, and the fix is explicitly requested by a customer. An example of this would be the change to the text in an HTML document, or the correction of a data element that is specific to a particular advisor or firm. 

Severity Level 4: 

All other system failures; for example, platform operation inconsistent with technical documentation, misspelled words, minor navigational errors, or minor graphical or display errors. 

^Maintenance Windows. 

^nightly window (5:30 p.m. - 10:00p.m.) and a quarterly scheduled maintenance window (2:00 p.m. Saturday - 8:00 a.m. Sunday).
