The failure of Seller to deliver written notice of an Objection Dispute to Buyer within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement to Seller shall be deemed acceptance of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement and agreement to the Purchase Price Adjustment amount by Seller. 

^^^ \centered (d) Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Objection Dispute and any resolution agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller shall be final and binding upon the parties.

The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of any unresolved Objection Disputes determined in accordance with the terms herein. The Accounting Arbitrator shall select as a resolution the position of either Buyer or Seller for each Objection Dispute (based solely on presentations and supporting material provided by the parties and not pursuant to any independent review) and may not impose an alternative resolution. Such report shall be final and binding upon all of the parties to this Agreement. Upon the agreement of Buyer and Seller or the decision of the Accounting Arbitrator, or if Seller fails to deliver written notice of disagreement to Buyer within the thirty (30) day period provided in Section 2.4(c), the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as adjusted if necessary pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement for purposes of calculating the Purchase Price Adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.4. The fees, expenses and costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. 

^^^ \centered (e) Any Purchase Price Adjustment shall be paid by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the party receiving such payment within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment. SLG hereby guarantees the obligations of Seller to pay the Purchase Price Adjustment to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.4 and CPPIB hereby guarantees the obligations of Buyer to pay the Purchase Price Adjustment to Seller pursuant to this Section 2.4, as applicable.

^^^ \centered (a) By Buyer. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.1, from and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, partners, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, “Seller Indemnitees”) from and against all Losses incurred by any of the Seller Indemnitees arising out of or relating to: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document. 

^^^ \centered (b) By Seller. Subject to the provisions of Sections 9.1 and 11.1, from and after the Closing, Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, partners, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, “Buyer Indemnitees”) from and against all Losses incurred by any of Buyer Indemnitees arising out of or relating to: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document. 

^^^ \centered (c) Limitations on Rights of Buyer Indemnitees. 

^^^^ \centered (i) Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of or relating to matters described in Section 9.2(b) unless and until the aggregate amount of all such claims for such matters exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 5: Number]]), in which event Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to recover Losses arising out of or relating to such matters only to the extent in excess thereof (the “Deductible”). Seller’s maximum liability to Buyer Indemnitees with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of or relating to matters described in Section 9.2(b) shall not exceed Six Million ($[[USD Value 6: Number]]) in the aggregate. No Losses shall be included in determining whether the Deductible has been reached unless a notice seeking indemnification for such Losses has been given by Buyer Indemnitees to Seller in accordance with Sections 9.2(d)(i) and 9.2(d)(ii)(A). 

^^^^ \centered (ii) Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of or relating to matters described in Section 9.2(b) made by any Buyer Indemnitee after Closing if the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim are known to the Buyer Indemnitee prior to the Closing. 

^^^ \centered (d) Procedure. 

^^^^ \centered (i) Direct Claims. If either a Buyer Indemnitee, on the one hand, or a Seller Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall have a claim for indemnification hereunder (the “Indemnitee”) for any claim other than a claim asserted by a third party, the Indemnitee     

^^^^ \centered shall, as promptly as is practicable, give written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the “Indemnitor”) of the nature and, to the extent practicable, a good faith estimate of the amount, of the claim. The failure to make prompt delivery of such written notice by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor (so long as a notice pursuant to this Section 9.2(d)(i), including the requisite certification, is given before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section 9.1) shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability under this Section 9.2 with respect to such matter, except to the extent the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by failure to give such notice. 

^^^^ \centered (ii) Third-Party Actions. 

^^^^^ \centered (A) If an Indemnitee receives notice or otherwise obtains knowledge of any matter or any threatened matter that may give rise to an indemnification claim against the Indemnitor (the “Third Party Claim”), then the Indemnitee shall as promptly as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days of the receipt of written notice of the Third Party Claim by the Indemnitee, deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice describing, to the extent practicable, such matter in reasonable detail and such notice must be accompanied by a copy of any written notice of the third party claimant to the Indemnitee asserting the Third Party Claim. The failure to make prompt delivery of such written notice or of the copy of the written notice of the third party claimant by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor (so long as a notice pursuant to this Section 9.2(d)(ii)(A) that includes any written notice of the third party claimant is given before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section 9.1) shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability under this Section 9.2 with respect to such matter, except to the extent the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by failure to give such notice. The Indemnitee shall deliver to the Indemnitor copies of all other notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall have the right, at its option, to assume the defense of any such matter with its own counsel, provided, however, that such counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. 
^^^^^ 
^^^^^ \centered (B) If the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of and indemnification for any such matter, then the Indemnitor shall proceed diligently to defend such matter and: 
^^^^^ 
^notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify the Indemnitee against any attorneys’ fees or other expenses incurred on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with such matter following the Indemnitor’s election to assume the defense of such matter, unless (x) the Indemnitor fails to defend diligently the action or proceeding within ten (10) days after receiving notice of such failure from the Indemnitee, (y) the Indemnitee reasonably shall have concluded 

(upon advice of its counsel) that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnitee or other Indemnitees that are not available to the Indemnitor, or (z) the Indemnitee reasonably shall have concluded (upon advice of its counsel) that, with respect to such claims, the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor may have different, conflicting, or adverse legal positions or interests. In addition, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense;

^the Indemnitee shall, at its own expense, make available to the Indemnitor all books, records and other documents and materials that are under the direct or indirect control of the Indemnitee or any of the Indemnitee’s agents and that the Indemnitor considers reasonably necessary or desirable for the defense of such matter, and cooperate in all reasonable ways with, and make its employees and advisors available or otherwise render reasonable assistance to, the Indemnitor and its agents at such times and places as may be reasonably necessary to defend against such Third Party Claim; and

^the Indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, settle, adjust or compromise any pending or threatened Litigation in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such Litigation) or consent to the entry of any judgment which (i) does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of applicable Laws or any violation of the rights of any Indemnitee, (ii) does not involve any relief affecting the Indemnitee other than monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnitor (other than the Deductible) and (iii) does not, to the extent that the Indemnitee may have any liability with respect to such Litigation, include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a complete and final written release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Litigation.

^^^^^ \centered (C) If the Indemnitor elects not to assume the defense of and indemnification for such matter, then the Indemnitee shall proceed diligently to defend such matter with the assistance of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor; provided, that the Indemnitee shall not settle, adjust or compromise such matter, or admit any liability with respect to such matter, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  
^^^ \centered (e) Subrogation. To the extent that the Indemnitor makes or is required to make any indemnification payment to the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of recovery) that the Indemnitee or any of the Indemnitee’s Affiliates may have against any other Person with respect to any Losses to which such indemnification payment is directly related, so long as the Indemnitee is not adversely affected thereby.    

^^^ \centered (f) **Exclusive Remedies Following the Closing Date**. Following the Closing Date, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the indemnification provisions of this Section 9.2 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnitees, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, for all matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including, without limitation, for any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein (other than claims of, and causes of action arising out of, fraud in the inducement in entering into this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents). 

^^^ \centered (g) Environmental Remedies. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer and its successors and assigns understand and agree that the indemnification obligations of Seller under this Section 9.2 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer Indemnitees with respect to any matters or claims arising under Environmental Laws, and Buyer and its successors and assigns hereby waive, and unconditionally release Seller from, any rights and remedies that Buyer and its successors and assigns may otherwise have against Seller under any Environmental Law, including, without limitation, any claims for contribution under CERCLA or common law. 

^^^ \centered (h) Purchase Price Adjustment. Any indemnification payment pursuant to this Section 9.2 shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for tax purposes to the extent permitted by Law. 

^^^ \centered (i) ROFR Waiver/Lender Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents, Seller’s sole obligation with respect to obtaining the ROFR Waiver and the Lender Approval shall be to, (x) with respect to obtaining the ROFR Waiver, execute and deliver the Sale Notice (as defined in the Shareholders’ Agreement) to RGI, which obligation the parties hereto agree has been satisfied, and (y) with respect to obtaining the Lender Approval, (1) deliver to Lender any information or material (A) prepared or procured by Buyer and (B) regarding Seller or the Contemplated Transaction that is in Seller’s possession, each as reasonably requested by Lender in connection with the Lender Approval, and (2) take any other actions reasonably requested by Buyer to facilitate obtaining Lender Approval, and Seller shall have no other obligation or liability to Buyer arising out of or relating to obtaining the Lender Approval and the ROFR Waiver. If Buyer shall determine that Seller is not in compliance with this Section 9.2(i), Buyer shall, as promptly as is practicable after becoming aware of Seller’s non-compliance, give written notice to Seller of the nature and manner in which Seller has failed to comply and provide Seller with a reasonable period to cure such non-compliance, subject in all respects to Section 10.1(c). The failure to make prompt delivery of such written notice by Buyer shall relieve Seller from any liability or obligation under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents (including Seller’s obligation to close the transactions contemplated hereunder) solely with respect to Seller’s failure to comply with the terms of this Section 9.2(i); provided, that the failure to make prompt delivery of such written notice by Buyer shall not impair or otherwise prejudice Buyer’s remedy to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.    

^^ \centered Termination; Default 

^^Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned:

^^^ \centered (a) by Buyer in accordance with 6.3(d)(ii); or 

^^^ \centered (b) by written notice from either Seller or Buyer in accordance with Section 5.8(a)(ii) or 5.9(a)(ii); or 

^^^ \centered (c) by written notice from either Seller or Buyer to the other party, at any time (i) prior to the Outside Date if either (A) RGI exercises its right of first refusal by delivering the Acceptance on the terms and conditions set forth in the Shareholders’ Agreement or (B) Senior Lender delivers a Lender Rejection to Seller or the Company or (ii) after the Outside Date if either Lender Approval or the ROFR Waiver have not been obtained, or have been obtained but are subsequently terminated, canceled or of no further force and effect. 

^^Procedure and Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Contemplated Transactions, written notice thereof shall be given by a terminating party to the other parties, and this Agreement shall terminate and the Contemplated Transactions shall be abandoned without further action by any of the parties. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1:

^^^ \centered (a) Buyer shall promptly cause to be returned to the Company or destroy all documents and information obtained in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions and all documents and information obtained in connection with Buyer’s investigation of the Company from the Company or its representatives, including any copies made by or supplied to Buyer or any of Buyer’s agents of any such documents or information, provided, Buyer may retain one copy of all such documents and information in order to comply with internal document retention and corporate governance policies and shall not be obligated to purge any information stored in an electronic back-up archive. 

^^^ \centered (b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, Buyer shall be entitled to a return of the Deposit, together with all interest accrued thereon. 

^^^ \centered (c) No party hereto shall have any obligation or liability to the other parties hereto, except that the parties hereto shall remain bound by the provisions of this Section 10.2 and Section 5.3 and Article XI and by the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting or breaching party from any liability or damages pursuant to Section 10.3 arising out of its breach of any covenant or agreement of this Agreement. 

^^Default.

^^^ \centered (a) If Seller shall perform all of its obligations hereunder in full compliance with the terms hereof and if all conditions to Buyer’s obligation to close have been satisfied, and if Buyer shall be in default in the performance of any material obligation hereunder (including,     

^^^ \centered without limitation, its failure or refusal to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement as required by the terms hereof), or if the failure of any of the conditions precedent to Seller’s obligation to close under Sections 6.1 and 6.2 is caused by or is a result of a breach by Buyer of any material representation, warranty, covenant, term, provision, agreement or obligation of Buyer hereunder, then Seller’s sole remedy shall be to elect to terminate this Agreement and retain the Deposit (including any interest accrued thereon), as and for liquidated damages, it being understood and agreed that Seller’s actual damages in such circumstances would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, and, upon such payment, this Agreement shall terminate and neither party hereto shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder. 

^^^ \centered (b) If Buyer shall perform all of its obligations hereunder in full compliance with the terms hereof and if all conditions to Seller’s obligation to close have been satisfied (provided Buyer shall not be required to tender the Estimated Closing Consideration Amount to Seller), and if Seller shall be in default in the performance of its obligations to close the transactions contemplated hereunder, then Buyer’s sole remedy shall be to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to Seller and Escrow Agent, in which case, (i) the Deposit, together with all interest accrued thereon, shall be returned to Buyer, and (ii) this Agreement shall terminate and neither party hereto shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder; provided, however, that if Seller shall be in willful default in the performance of its obligations to close the transactions contemplated hereunder, then Buyer’s sole remedy shall be to either (x) terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.3(b) or (y) file an action to obtain specific performance of Seller’s obligations hereunder, it being acknowledged and agreed that the subject matter of this transaction is unique. 

^^ \centered Miscellaneous 

^^Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Contemplated Transactions are consummated; provided that (i) Buyer and Seller shall each pay [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of all fees and expenses, up to an aggregate amount equal to $[[USD Value 7: Number]] associated with obtaining the Lender Approval, and Buyer shall pay all fees and expenses in excess of $[[USD Value 8: Number]] associated with obtaining the Lender Approval and (ii) Buyer and Seller shall each pay [[Percentage 6]]% of all fees and expenses associated with the Escrow Agent and the Escrow Agreement. The parties acknowledge that they believe that there are no Transfer Taxes arising in connection with the Contemplated Transactions and accordingly agree that they will not file Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes upon consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. In the event Transfer Taxes are imposed as a result of aggregation of the Contemplated Transactions with any subsequent transfers or any prior Transfers unrelated to Seller’s Common Stock, Buyer shall pay all associated Transfer Taxes and shall timely file all related Tax Returns with the applicable Taxing Authority. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer in filing any Tax Returns pursuant to the previous sentence (including having the appropriate officers of Seller execute such Tax Returns). In the event that, as a result of an audit by a Taxing Authority, it is determined, after the Closing, that Transfer Taxes are imposed solely as a result of aggregation of the Contemplated Transactions with any other prior direct or indirect transfers made by either Seller or the owners of the direct or indirect equity interests in Seller, then Seller shall pay all associated Transfer Taxes. Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall (i) timely notify the other party in writing of any inquiry from or audit by any Taxing Authority involving Transfer Taxes with respect to the Contemplated Transactions for which the other party (the “Responsible Party”) is liable pursuant to this Section 11.1 and (ii) promptly provide to the Responsible Party copies of any information or document requests, notices of proposed adjustment or similar reports or notices of deficiencies related to such inquiry or audit; provided that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect the Responsible Party’s liability under this Section 11.1 except to the extent such failure materially impairs the Responsible Party’s ability to contest any such Tax Transfer Taxes. The Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall have the sole right to control any audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to Transfer Taxes for which it is the Responsible Party and the other party shall cooperate in such audit or proceeding as reasonably requested by the Responsible Party (including, but not limited to, providing the Responsible Party with a power of attorney (or other documentation) required to authorize the Responsible Party to represent the parties in such audit or proceeding); provided that the other party shall be permitted, at its own expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such audit or proceeding. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall settle or compromise a claim or consent to the entry of any judgment arising out of any such inquiry or audit with respect to a Transfer Tax for which it is not the Responsible Party without the prior written consent of the Responsible Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The provisions of this Section 11.1 shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.

^^Notices. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made (a) as of the date delivered, if delivered personally, (b) on the date the delivering party receives confirmation, if delivered by facsimile, (c) three (3) Business Days after being mailed by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) or (d) one (1) Business Day after being sent by overnight courier (providing proof of delivery), to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified in a notice given in accordance with this Section 11.2):

^^Governing Law. This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws (excluding conflict of laws rules and principles) of the State of [[Address 14: Address]] agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, including all matters of construction, validity and performance.

^^Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, the Ancillary Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior Contracts or agreements, whether oral or written.

^^Severability. Should any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance be held invalid or unenforceable to any extent: (a) such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, and only to the extent, of such unenforceability or prohibition and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by Law, (b) such unenforceability or prohibition in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision as applied (i) to other Persons or circumstances or (ii) in any other jurisdiction, and (c) such unenforceability or prohibition shall not affect or invalidate any other provision of this Agreement.

^^Amendment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended, supplemented or modified orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by Buyer and Seller; provided that the observance of any provision of this Agreement may be waived in writing by the party that will lose the benefit of such provision as a result of such waiver.

^^Effect of Waiver or Consent. No waiver or consent, express or implied, by any party to or of any breach or default by any party in the performance by such party of its obligations hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver to or of any other breach or default in the performance by such party of the same or any other obligations of such party hereunder. No single or partial exercise of any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce any right or power, shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. Failure on the part of a party to complain of any act of any party or to declare any party in default, irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver by such party of its rights hereunder until the applicable statute of limitation period has run.

^^Parties in Interest; Limitation on Rights of Others. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors and assigns.

^^Assignability/Sale Restrictions.

^^This Agreement shall not be assigned by either Seller or Buyer without the prior written consent of the other party, provided, that Buyer may, without limiting Section 11.9(b), (i) assign this Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder, without the consent of Seller, to an Affiliate of Buyer that is controlled by CPPIB or (ii) designate a Person to accept delivery of the Seller’s Existing Certificates subject to and in accordance with Section 7.3, so long as such assignment or designation, as the case may be, is (A) permitted under the Shareholders’ Agreement, (B) does not require a new Sale Notice (as defined in the Shareholders’ Agreement) to be delivered to RGI pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement, and (C) does not require any authorization, consent or approval from Lender which has not already been obtained, and all references to Buyer contained in this Agreement shall thereafter include such Affiliate of Buyer. For purposes of this Section 11.9, the term “control” means the ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than [[Percentage 6]]% of the interests in a Person, together with the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether by contract or otherwise.


^^^ \centered (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from the period beginning on the date hereof and ending eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Seller, Buyer shall not sell, transfer or assign any of Seller’s Common Stock or any of Buyer’s interest in this Agreement if such transaction would yield Buyer, on a pro-rata basis based on the amount of Seller’s Common Stock or interest sold, transferred or assigned, an amount in excess of the Closing Consideration Amount plus all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions. The provisions of this Section 11.9(b) shall survive the Closing for a period of eighteen (18) months. 

^^Jurisdiction; Court Proceedings; Waiver of Jury Trial. Any Litigation against any party to this Agreement arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement shall be brought in any federal or state court located in the State of [[Address 15: Address]] York County and each of the parties hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any such Litigation; provided, that a final judgment in any such Litigation shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. **Each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert (a) any objection which it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such Litigation in any federal or state court**

**located in the State of [[Address 15: Address]] York County,** (b) any claim that any such Litigation brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and (c) any claim that such court does not have jurisdiction with respect to such Litigation. To the extent that service of process by mail is permitted by applicable Law, each party irrevocably consents to the service of process in any such Litigation in such courts by the mailing of such process by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, at its address for notices provided for herein. **Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right to a trial by jury and agrees that any of them may file a copy of this paragraph with any court as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary and bargained-for agreement among the parties irrevocably to waive its right to trial by jury in any Litigation.**

^^No Other Duties. The only duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement are as specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no other duties or obligations shall be implied in fact, Law or equity, or under any principle of fiduciary obligation.

^^Reliance on Counsel and Other Advisors. Each party has consulted such legal, financial, technical or other expert as it deems necessary or desirable before entering into this Agreement.
