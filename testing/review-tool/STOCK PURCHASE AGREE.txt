\centered **STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

This Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of [[Date 1]] (this “**Agreement**”), is by and among [[Company]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (the “**Company**”), and CAPGEN CAPITAL GROUP IV LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“**CapGen**”), and each of the respective other investors set forth on the signature pages to this Agreement (collectively, with CapGen, the “**Investors**”).

The Company seeks to issue and sell to CapGen, and CapGen seeks to purchase (the “**Investment**”), [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the “**Common Stock**”), at a purchase price of $[[USD Value 4: Number]].00 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Company is also selling Common Stock in the aggregate amount of $10 million to other Accredited Investors, in each case, at a purchase price per share of $10.00 (collectively, with the Investment, the “**Private Placement**”). The shares of Common Stock to be sold on the Private Placement are collectively referred to herein as the “**Purchased Shares.**” The number of Purchased Shares to be purchased by each Investor hereunder is set forth on such Investor’s signature page. Each of CapGen and the other Investors are acting separately.

The Company has agreed to acquire Atlantic BancGroup, Inc., a Florida corporation (“**ABI**”), through a merger (the “**Merger**”) pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of [[Date 1]], by and between the Company and ABI (the “**Merger Agreement**”).

The Merger Agreement includes an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “**Bank Merger Agreement**”) pursuant to which ABI’s subsidiary, Oceanside Bank (“**Oceanside Bank**”), will be merged with the Company’s subsidiary, The Jacksonville Bank, Jacksonville, Florida, a Florida state-chartered commercial bank (the “**Bank**”). Herein, the merger of Oceanside Bank and the Bank is called the “**Bank Merger**”, and the Merger and the Bank Merger are collectively called the “**Mergers**”. The Company will issue, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, shares of Common Stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of ABI, except shares held by dissenting shareholders, if any.

The obligations of the Investor to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are specifically conditioned upon the completion of both Mergers prior to the Investment by Investor. The closings of the Mergers (the “**Merger Closings**”) and the closing of the Investment will occur on the same day.

In consideration of the premises, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

\centered **PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE PURCHASED SHARES**

^**Issuance, Sale and Delivery of the Purchased Shares**. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Company shall issue, sell and deliver to each Investor, and each Investor shall, severally and not jointly, purchase from the Company, the Purchased Shares set forth on such Investor’s signature page, free and clear of all liens, pledges, security interests, charges and other encumbrances, including any restrictions on voting such Purchased Shares (“**Liens**”), other than those placed thereon by or on behalf of an Investor with respect solely to such Investor’s Purchased Shares (such issuance, sale and purchase of the Purchased Shares, along with the other commitments by each party to the other set forth in this Agreement, the “**Transaction**”).

^**Closing**. The parties shall consummate the Transaction at a mutually agreeable location upon satisfaction (or waiver, other than a waiver of any condition set forth in Section 4.06) of all conditions to Closing; provided that such consummation may not occur prior to the end of the 20-day period commencing following the issuance of a notice by CapGen to its investors to call funds required to purchase the Purchased Shares that CapGen is acquiring (the “**Investor Call**”). The Company and the Investors will cooperate with a view to the Company closing both Mergers (the effective dates and times of the Mergers are each called a “**Merger Effective Time**”) not sooner than set forth in the preceding sentence and at the end of a calendar month, with the closing (the “**Closing**”) of the purchase of the Purchased Shares by the Investor occurring following the Merger Effective Times for both Mergers but on the same day (the “**Closing Date**”). At the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company shall issue and deliver to each Investor the Purchased Shares set forth on such Investor’s signature page in accordance with Section 1.01 in certificate form or in uncertificated book-entry form pursuant to instructions of such Investor provided to the Company at least three Business Days in advance of the Closing Date.

^**Payment of Purchase Price**. As payment in full for the Purchased Shares, on the Closing Date, upon receipt of the Purchased Shares, each Investor shall deliver to the Company an aggregate amount equal to $10.00 per Purchased Share to be acquired by each Investor hereunder (such aggregate amount, the “**Purchase Price**”). Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account that is designated by the Company at least three Business Days in advance of the Closing Date.

^**Anti-Dilution**. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the outstanding shares of Common Stock are changed or exchanged for a different number of kind of shares or securities as a result of any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other substantially similar transaction, the parties shall make an appropriate and proportionate adjustment to the number of Purchased Shares or the Purchase Price.

\centered **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

The Company represents and warrants to each Investor, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties are limited expressly to an earlier specific date, in which case such representations and warranties were accurate on and as of such specified date) as follows and understands that each Investor is relying on these representations and warranties:

^**Organization and Standing**.   
^^The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Florida and is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “**BHCA**”). The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

^^**Schedule I** sets forth all Subsidiaries of the Company. The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the capital stock of each Subsidiary free and clear of any and all Liens, and all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary are validly issued and are fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive and similar rights to subscribe for or purchase securities. The Company’s principal Subsidiary and sole banking Subsidiary is the Bank. Each Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or incorporation. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC, and all FDIC insurance premiums and assessments required to be paid have been paid when due.

^**Corporate Power**. The Company and each Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority (corporate and other) to carry on its business as it is now being conducted to own, lease or operate all its properties and assets, and to complete the Mergers and to conduct the business and own lease and operate all properties and assets of ABI, Oceanside Bank and their subsidiaries immediately after the Mergers. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transaction. Each of the Company and the Bank has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action, subject to shareholder approval, necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Merger Agreements and this Agreement and to consummate the Mergers and the Private Placement (including the Transaction).

^**Corporate Authority**.   
^^This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Investor, this Agreement is a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights or to general equity principles. The Merger Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company and the Bank. The Merger Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and the Bank and the other parties thereto, and are valid and legally binding agreements, enforceable by the Company and the Bank in accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights or to general equity principles.

^^The Board (at a meeting or meetings duly called and held) has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Private Placement (including the Transaction) are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of, the shareholders of the Company, (ii) directed that the Private Placement (including the Transaction) be submitted to the shareholders of the Company for their approval and resolved to recommend the approval of the Private Placement (including the Transaction) and the amendment and restatement of the Company’s Articles of Incorporation by the shareholders of the Company (the “**Company Board Recommendation**”), and (iii) irrevocably taken all necessary steps to render the provisions of Section 607.0901 of the Florida Business Corporation Act (the “**FBCA**”) regarding business combinations with “interested shareholders” and Section 607.0902 of the FBCA regarding “control-share acquisitions,” as well as similar provisions set forth in the Company’s articles of incorporation or other organizational documents, inapplicable to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Private Placement (including the Transaction). Giving effect to the Board actions described in this Section 2.03(b), no U.S. federal or state “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” “business combination,” “fair price” or other form of anti-takeover laws or regulations (such laws or regulations, “**Takeover Laws**”) are applicable to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Private Placement (including the Transaction). The Company has no shareholder rights plan, poison pill or similar arrangement relating to accumulations of beneficial ownership of Common Stock or a change in control of the Company.

^**Regulatory Approvals; Shareholder Approval; No Violations**. 

^^No consents, approvals, permits, orders, authorizations of, exemptions, reviews or waivers by, or notices, reports, filings, declarations or registrations with, any federal, state or local court, governmental, legislative, judicial, administrative authority, Regulatory Authority, taxing authority, agency, commission, body or other governmental entity or self regulatory organization (each, a “**Governmental Authority**”) or with any third party are required to be made or obtained by the Company, the Bank or any Subsidiary of either of them in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement or the consummation of the purchase of the Purchased Shares or any other aspect of the Transaction or the consummation of the Mergers except for (i) the necessary approvals of the Merger and the Bank Merger by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Florida Division, respectively; (ii) the necessary approvals of CapGen to purchase the Purchased Shares and become a bank holding company controlling the Company as required by the Transaction and notices to the Federal Reserve of the proposed purchases by the other Investors; (iii) those already obtained or made; and (iv) any securities or “blue sky” filings of any state.

^^In addition to the shareholder vote required by the rules and regulations of Nasdaq applicable to companies whose common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (the “**Nasdaq Stock Market**”) in connection with the issuance of the Purchased Shares, the only vote of the holders of outstanding securities of the Company required by the Company’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, Applicable Law, or otherwise, to consummate the sale of the Purchased Shares and approve the adoption of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation set forth on **Schedule II** is the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, voting together as a single class, except for those provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation listed in Section 2.04(b) of the Company’s disclosure schedule (the “**Disclosure Schedule**”), for which 66 2/[[Percentage 1: Number]]% vote of all outstanding shares of Common Stock, voting together as a single class, is required (collectively, all required shareholder votes are the “**Requisite Shareholder Vote**” ).

^^The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company does not, and (assuming the Requisite Shareholder Vote is obtained) the consummation by the Company of the Private Placement (including the Transaction) and the Mergers will not, (i) constitute or result in a breach or violation of, or a default under, the acceleration of any obligations or penalties or the creation of any Lien or exception to title of any kind on the assets of the Company or any Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) pursuant to, agreements binding upon the Company or any Subsidiary or to which the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties is subject or bound or any law, regulation, judgment or governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties is subject; except, in the case of this clause (i), for any breach, violation, default, acceleration, debt repayment trigger or creation that, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) constitute or result in a breach or violation of, or a default under, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws of the Company or the organizational documents of any Subsidiary, in each case, effective as of the Closing Date.

^**Company Capital Stock; Purchased Shares**. (a) As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists solely of [[Shares 2: Number]] shares of Common Stock, of which [[Shares 3: Number]] shares are issued and outstanding (excluding shares of unvested time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock) and [[Shares 4: Number]] shares of preferred stock, par value $[[USD Value 7: Number]] per share, of which no shares have been designated or are issued or outstanding. As of the date hereof, [[Shares 5: Number]] shares of Common Stock are issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options to acquire such shares, there are 91,000 outstanding shares of unvested time-based and performance-based restricted Common Stock, [[Shares 6: Number]] shares of Common Stock are issuable to ABI’s shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and [[Shares 7: Number]] shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance upon exercise of stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $14.52, which have been granted and remained outstanding as of May 10, 2010. The outstanding shares of Common Stock have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and are not subject to preemptive rights (and were not issued in violation of any preemptive rights). No options, rights or warrants have been granted with respect to shares of Common Stock since [[Date 2: Date]].

^^The Purchased Shares have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company subject to the receipt of the Requisite Shareholder Vote, and, when issued and delivered as provided in this Agreement, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and the issuance thereof will not be subject to any preemptive rights, except in favor of the Investors as provided herein. Except with respect to the options and restricted stock described in Section 2.05(a), the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has and is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of, or securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for, any shares of capital stock of the Company or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock of the Company (including any rights plan or agreement). There are no outstanding securities or instruments of the Company or which contain any redemption or similar provisions, and there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which the Company is or may become bound to redeem a security of the Company. There are no securities or instruments containing anti-dilution or similar provisions that will be triggered by the issuance of the Purchased Shares.

^**Company Reports; Financial Statements, Etc**. (a) The Company and each Subsidiary has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all forms, filings, registrations, submissions, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since [[Date 3: Date]]. Such forms, statements, reports and documents filed or furnished since [[Date 4: Date]], including any amendments thereto, are called the “**Company Reports**”. Each of the Company Reports to the SEC, at the time of its filing or being furnished, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act applicable to the Company Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. 

^^The Company’s consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any notes thereto) contained in the Company Reports: (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of interim consolidated financial statements, where information and footnotes contained in such financial statements are not required under the rules of the SEC to be in compliance with GAAP); and (ii) complied as to form, as of their respective filing dates, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. Such consolidated financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, consolidated changes in shareholder equity and consolidated cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods covered thereby (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments that were not and that are not expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole). All annual financial statements of the Company have been audited by independent registered public accounting firms.

^^The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market, its successor or other stock exchange upon which any Company securities are listed.

^^The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act or otherwise is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Such disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.

^**Tax Matters**. (a) For purposes of this Section 2.10, the following definitions shall apply:

^^^The term “**Group**” means, individually and collectively, (A) the Company; (B) the Bank; (C) the affiliated group as defined in Section 1504(a) of the Code of which the Bank is or has been a member at any time; and (D) any individual, trust, corporation, partnership, limited liability company or any other entity as to which the Company or the Bank is liable for Taxes incurred by such individual or entity either as a transferee, or pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6, or pursuant to any other provision of federal, territorial, state, local or foreign law or regulations, including without limitation as part of a combined or unitary group.

^^^The term “**Taxes**” means all taxes, however denominated, including, without limitation, any interest, penalties or other additions that may become payable in respect thereof, imposed by any Governmental Authority, which taxes shall include, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all income or profits taxes (including, without limitation, federal income taxes and state income taxes), alternative or add-on minimum taxes, estimated taxes, payroll and employee withholding taxes, back-up withholding and other withholding taxes, unemployment insurance, social security taxes, sales and use taxes, value added taxes, ad valorem taxes, excise taxes, franchise taxes, gross receipts taxes, business license taxes, occupation taxes, real and personal property taxes, stamp taxes, environmental taxes, transfer taxes, workers’ compensation and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, self dealing or prohibited transactions taxes, customs, duties, capital stock taxes, and other obligations of the same or of a similar nature to any of the foregoing, which the Group is required to pay, withhold or collect, whether disputed or not.

^^^The term “**Returns**” means all reports, estimates, declarations of estimated tax, claims for refund, information statements and returns required to be prepared or filed in connection with, any Taxes, employee agreement or Plan, including any schedule or attachment thereto, and including any amendment thereof.

^^All Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of any members of the Group prior to the Closing Date have been, or will be, duly filed on a timely basis, subject to any applicable extensions. Such Returns are true, correct and complete. All Taxes owed by any members of the Group (whether or not shown on any Return) have been paid in full on a timely basis, and no other Taxes are owing or payable by the Group with respect to items or periods covered by such Returns or with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the date of this representation and warranty for which a Return was due prior to such date. No claim has ever been made by any Governmental Authority for any jurisdiction in which any member of the Group does not file Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. No security interests, liens, encumbrances, attachments or similar interests exist on or with respect to any of the assets of the Group that arose in connection with any failure or alleged failure to pay any Taxes. Each member of the Group has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any and all officers, directors, employees and agents (including, without limitation, any independent contractor, foreign person or other third person) in compliance with all tax withholding provisions of applicable federal, state, local and foreign law (including, without limitation, income, social security, employment tax withholding, and withholding under Sections 1441 through 1446 of the Code). The Bank has timely complied with all requirements under Applicable Laws relating to information, reporting and withholding and other similar matters for customer and other accounts (including back-up withholding and furnishing of Forms 1099 and all similar reports).

^^The amount of the Group’s liability for unpaid Taxes for all periods ending on or before the last day of the month before the Closing Date (including accruals for any exposure item) shall not, in the aggregate, exceed the amount of the liability accruals for Taxes, as such accruals are reflected on the Group’s most recent consolidated balance sheet contained in the Company Reports.

The Returns of the Group for all tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired have never been audited by a Governmental Authority, nor is any such audit in process, pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. Neither the Company nor any director or officer (or employee responsible for Tax matters) of any other member of the Group is aware of any facts or circumstances that, if known by any Governmental Authority would be reasonably likely to cause the Governmental Authority to assess any additional Taxes for any period for which Returns have been filed.

^^No member of the Group has (i) been or shall be required to include any adjustment in taxable income for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing in accordance with Section 481 of the Code or any comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws as a result of transactions or events occurring prior to the Closing; (ii) filed any disclosure under Section 6662 of the Code or comparable provisions of state, local or foreign Law to prevent the imposition of penalties with respect to any Tax reporting position taken on any Tax Return; (iii) engaged in a “reportable transaction,” as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b); (iv) ever been a member of a consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group of which the Company or the Bank was not the ultimate parent company; (v) been the “distributing corporation” or the “controlled corporation” (in each case, within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1) of the Code) with respect to a transaction described in Section 355 of the Code (A) within the two-year period ending as of the date of this Agreement, or (B) in a distribution that would otherwise constitute part of a “plan” or “series of related transactions” (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code); (vi) incurred any actual or potential liability under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable or similar provision of federal, state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, as a result of any contractual obligation, or otherwise for any Taxes of any Person other than the Company or the Bank; or (vii) ever been a “United States real property holding corporation” within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code.

^^Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, each Investor covenants that the Purchased Shares may be disposed of only pursuant to an effective registration statement under, and in compliance with the requirements of, the Securities Act, or pursuant to an available exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in compliance with any applicable state, federal or foreign securities laws.

As a condition of transfer (other than pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence), any such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall have the rights of the transferring Investor under this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement with respect to such transferred Purchased Shares.

^^Each Investor covenants that it will not knowingly make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of any Purchased Shares, or engage in hedging transactions with respect to such Purchased Shares, in violation of the Securities Act (including Regulation S) or the Exchange Act.

^^Each Investor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) each certificate evidencing the Purchased Shares will bear a legend to the effect set forth below; and (b) except to the extent such restrictions are waived by the Company, neither shall transfer any Purchased Shares represented by any such certificate without complying with the restrictions on transfer described in the legend endorsed on such certificate, as follows and which shall be delivered also as instructions to the Company’s transfer agent:

Following the earlier of (i) the effective date of the registration statement registering such Purchased Shares for resale (the “**Resale Registration Statement**”) or (ii) Rule 144 becoming available for the resale of Purchased Shares, without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information required under 144(c)(1) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable) as to the Purchased Shares and without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions, the Company shall, upon delivery of appropriate documentation by the Holder, instruct the Transfer Agent at the Company’s expense, to remove the legend from the Purchased Shares. If a legend is no longer required pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will no later than 3 Trading Days following the delivery by a Holder to the Company or the Transfer Agent (with notice to the Company) of a legended certificate or instrument representing such Purchased Shares (endorsed or with stock powers attached, signatures guaranteed, and otherwise in form necessary to affect the reissuance and/or transfer) and a representation letter to the extent required by Section 6.08(b), (such third Trading Day, the “**Legend Removal Date**”) deliver or cause to be delivered to such Investor a certificate or instrument (as the case may be) representing such Purchased Shares that is free from all restrictive legends. The Company may not make any notation on its records or give instructions to the Transfer Agent that enlarge the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 6.08(e). Certificates for Purchased Shares free from all restrictive legends may be transmitted by the Transfer Agent to the Investors by crediting the account of the Investor’s prime broker with DTC as directed by such Investor.

\centered **OTHER AGREEMENTS**

^**Bank Holding Company Status**. Solely as a result of the consummation of the Private Placement and the Merger, no Investor other than CapGen shall exercise “control” for purposes of the BHCA or the Change in Bank Control Act, of the Company or the Bank.

^**Preemptive Rights**. (a) If the Company offers to sell Covered Securities (as defined below) in a public or private offering of Covered Securities solely for cash any time during a period of 24 months commencing on the Closing Date (a “**Qualified Offering**”), each Investor shall be afforded the opportunity to acquire from the Company, for the same price and on the same terms as such Covered Securities are offered, in the aggregate up to the amount of Covered Securities required to enable it to maintain its Investor Percentage Interest. “**Investor Percentage Interest**” means, as of any date of determination, the percentage equal to (A) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Investor as of the date of determination divided by (B) the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as of such date. “**Covered Securities**” means Common Stock and any rights, options or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, other than securities that are (A) issued by the Company pursuant to any employment contract, employee incentive or benefit plan, stock purchase plan, stock ownership plan, stock option or equity compensation plan or other similar plan where stock is being issued or offered to a trust, other entity to or for the benefit of any employees, consultants, officers or directors of the Company, (B) issued by the Company in connection with a business combination or other merger, acquisition or disposition transaction, partnership, joint venture, strategic alliance or investment by the Company or similar non-capital raising transaction, or (C) issued as a dividend or in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder purchase plan.

^^Prior to making any Qualified Offering of Covered Securities, the Company shall give the Investor written notice at the address shown on each Investor’s signature page hereto of its intention to make such an offering, describing, to the extent then known, the anticipated amount of securities, and other material terms then known to the Company upon which the Company proposes to offer the same (such notice, a “**Qualified Offering Notice**”). The Investor shall then have 10 days after receipt of the Qualified Offering Notice (the “**Offer Period**”) to notify the Company in writing that it intends to exercise such preemptive right and as to the amount of Covered Securities the Investor desires to purchase, up to the maximum amount calculated pursuant to Section 7.02(a) (the “**Designated Securities**”). Such notice constitutes a non-binding indication of interest of the Investor to purchase the amount of Designated Securities specified by the Investor (or a proportionately lesser amount if the amount of Covered Securities to be offered in such Qualified Offering is subsequently reduced) at the price (or range of prices) established in the Qualified Offering and other terms set forth in the Company’s notice to it. The failure to respond during the Offer Period constitutes a waiver of its preemptive right in respect of such offering. The sale of the Covered Securities in the Qualified Offering, including any Designated Securities, shall be closed not later than 30 days after the end of the Offer Period except as to any Investor that requires prior approval of the Federal Reserve and/or other Governmental Authorities, in which case the closing of any the sale of Covered Securities to such Investor shall occur as soon as practicable following the receipt of all necessary Governmental Authority approvals and the expiration of statutory waiting periods. The Covered Securities to be sold to other investors in such Qualified Offering shall be sold at a price not less than, and upon terms no more favorable to such other investors than, those specified in the Qualified Offering Notice. If the Company does not consummate the sale of Covered Securities to other investors within such 30-day period (excluding Investors that require prior approval of the Federal Reserve and/or other Governmental Authorities), the right provided hereunder shall be revived and such securities shall not be offered unless first reoffered to the Investors in accordance herewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein and unless otherwise agreed by the Investor, by not later than the end of such 30-day period, the Company shall either confirm in writing to the Investor that the Qualified Offering has been abandoned or shall publicly disclose its intention to issue the Covered Securities in the Qualified Offering, in either case in such a manner that the Investor will not be in possession of any material, non-public information thereafter.

^^If the Investor exercises its preemptive right provided in this Section 7.02 with respect to a Qualified Offering that is an underwritten public offering or an offering made to qualified institutional buyers (as such term is defined in SEC Rule 144A under the Securities Act) for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act (a “**Rule 144A offering**”), a private placement or other offering, whether not registered under the Securities Act, the Company shall offer and sell the Investor, if any such offering is consummated, the Designated Securities (as adjusted, upward to reflect the actual size of such offering when priced) at the same price as the Covered Securities are offered to third persons (not including the underwriters or the initial purchasers in a Rule 144A offering that is being reoffered by the initial purchasers) in such offering and shall provide written notice of such price upon the determination of such price.

^^Anything to the contrary in this Section 7.02 notwithstanding, the preemptive right to purchase Covered Securities granted by this Section 7.02 shall terminate as of and not be available any time after the date on which the Investor sells all of the Purchased Shares or any interest therein.

^^In addition to the pricing provision of Section 7.02(c), the Company will offer and sell the Designated Securities to the Investor upon terms and conditions not less favorable than the most favorable terms and conditions offered to other persons or entities in a Qualified Offering.

^**Compensation Matters**. Prior to the Closing, the Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate (including securing any necessary waivers or consents) to provide that the issuance of the Purchased Shares to the Investor as contemplated by this Agreement will not trigger any payment, termination or rights under any “change of control” provision in any agreements to which the Company, the Bank or any of the Subsidiaries is a party, including any employment, “change in control,” severance or other compensatory agreements and any Benefit Plan, which results in payments to the counterparty, the acceleration or vesting of benefits or payments (including debt repayments).

^**Reasonable Best Efforts**. After the Closing Date, each party and its officers and directors shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all further actions necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and their respective covenants, agreements and obligations hereunder.

^**Manner of Offerings**. The Company will offer and issue the shares of Common Stock to Investors that are Accredited Investors in transactions exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act on terms and conditions, including price, no more favorable than provided to CapGen, without CapGen's prior written consent, following full disclosure of all such terms and conditions (including any side letters or other agreements, arrangement or understandings) to CapGen. If CapGen determines that the other Investors are receiving a more favorable price, or terms and conditions more favorable than those granted to the Investor hereby, the Company will cooperate with CapGen to provide CapGen with terms, conditions and rights in favor of CapGen no less favorable than those granted to any other Person in the Private Placement (including the Transaction). CapGen shall purchase its Purchased Shares at the same per share price being offered to the other Investors, and the complete terms and conditions of CapGen’s purchase of its Purchased Shares are set forth herein.

^**Indemnification**.   

^^**Indemnification of the Investor**. In addition to the indemnity provided in the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will indemnify and hold the Investor and its directors, officers, shareholders, members, partners, employees and agents (and any other persons with a functionally equivalent role of a person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title), each person who controls the Investor (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, shareholders, agents, members, partners or employees (and any other persons with a functionally equivalent role of a person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title) of such controlling person (each, an “**Investor Party**”), from any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in permitted settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees of one counsel and costs of investigation that any such Investor Party may suffer or incur as a result of (i) any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Company in this Agreement or (ii) any action instituted against an Investor Party in any capacity, by any shareholder of the Company who is not Investor Party or an affiliate of that Investor Party, with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement. The Company will not be liable to any Investor Party under this Agreement to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to any Investor Party’s breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by such Purchaser Party in this Agreement or in the other Private Placement Documents.

^^**Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings**. Promptly after receipt by any person (the “**Indemnified Person**”) of notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement of any action, proceeding or investigation in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 7.06(a), such Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the Company in writing and the Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of one counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, and shall assume the payment of all fees and expenses; provided, however, the failure of any Indemnified Person so to notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Company is actually and materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure to notify. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless: (i) the Company and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel; (ii) the Company shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person in such proceeding; or (iii) in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such Indemnified Person, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, the Company shall not effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such proceeding.

If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, this Agreement shall become void as and to the extent provided in Section 8.01, except that Section 7.06, this Section 8.02 and shall survive any such termination; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any breaching party from liability for an uncured willful breach of a representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement giving rise to such termination.

^^In the event that this Agreement is terminated by or as to CapGen, then, except as provided in this Section 8.02(b), the Company shall, one Business Day after the date of such termination, pay to CapGen, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of $[[USD Value 3: Number]] (the “**Termination Fee**”).

The Company acknowledges that this Section 8.02(b) is an integral part of the Transaction and is in recognition of the time, expense and efforts expended and to be expended by CapGen as the lead Investor, and that, without this Section 8.02(b), CapGen would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the Termination Fee that is payable and, in order to obtain such payment, CapGen commences a lawsuit or action that results in a judgment for any of such Termination Fee, the Company shall pay CapGen its costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and charges) in connection with such lawsuit. Payment of the Termination Fee described in this Section 8.02(b) shall be the exclusive remedy for termination of this Agreement as specified in this Section 8.02(b) and shall be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of any termination of this Agreement.

^**Severability**.

^**Entire Agreement**. This Agreement, including the schedules hereto and the Registration Rights Agreement, constitutes the final agreement between the parties. It is the complete and exclusive expression of the parties’ agreement on the matters contained in this Agreement. All prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements between the parties on the matters contained in this Agreement are expressly merged into and superseded by this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement may not be explained, supplemented or qualified through evidence of trade usage or a prior course of dealings. In entering into this Agreement, neither party has relied upon any statement, representation, warranty or agreement of the other party except for those expressly contained in this Agreement. There are no conditions precedent to the effectiveness of this Agreement, other than those expressly stated in this Agreement.

^**Counterparts**. The parties may execute this Agreement in multiple counterparts, each of which constitutes an original, and all of which, collectively, constitute only one and the same agreement. The signatures of all of the parties need not appear on the same counterpart, and delivery of an executed counterpart signature page by facsimile shall have the same force and effect as a manually executed original. This Agreement is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each party to the other parties. 

^**Independent Nature of Investors’ Obligations and Rights**. The obligations of each Investor under the Private Placement Documents are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Investor, and no Investor shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other Investor under any Private Placement Document.

The decision of each Investor to purchase Securities pursuant to the Private Placement Documents has been made by such Investor independently of any other Investor. Each Investor acknowledges that no other Investor has acted as agent or fiduciary for or representative of such Investor in connection with such Investor making its investment hereunder and that no other Investor will be acting as agent or fiduciary for or representative of such Investor in connection with monitoring such Investor's investment in the Securities or enforcing its rights under the Private Placement Documents. The Company and each Investor confirms that each Investor has independently participated with the Company in the negotiation of the transaction contemplated hereby with the advice of its own counsel and advisors. Each Investor shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of any other Private Placement Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Investor to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. The use of a single agreement to effectuate the purchase and sale of the Securities contemplated hereby is solely for convenience. It is expressly understood and agreed that each provision contained in this Agreement and in each other Private Placement Document is between the Company and a Investor, solely, and not between the Company and the Investors collectively and not between and among the Investors.
