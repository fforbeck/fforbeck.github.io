Subject to of this Agreement, the Sellers shall indemnify and hold the Buyer and the Company (after the Closing), and their respective Affiliates, harmless from and against any and all obligations that the Buyer or the Company may incur relating to or arising out of the Retained Liabilities. 

^^**Post-Closing Adjustment** 

2.6.1. As soon as practicable (but in no event later than sixty (60) days) after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers’ Representative a balance sheet for the Company as of the Closing Date (the “Closing Balance Sheet”) which shows the Working Capital Amount, which shall be prepared (i) in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date of such preparation and (ii) in a manner consistent with the Company’s accounting policies and practices used in the preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. 

2.6.2. The Closing Balance Sheet shall become final and binding on Sellers and Buyer unless Sellers’ Representative gives a written notice of disagreement (a “Notice of Disagreement”) to Buyer within thirty (30) days following receipt by Sellers’ Representative of the Closing Balance Sheet. Any such Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted. Buyer shall have fifteen (15) days following receipt of such Notice of Disagreement to review the same. If Sellers’ Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet within twenty (20) days following Buyer’s receipt of the Notice of Disagreement, Sellers’ Representative and Buyer shall refer their remaining differences to the Dispute Accountant, which shall, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, determine, and only with respect to the remaining differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the Working Capital Amount as set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet requires adjustment. Sellers’ Representative and Buyer shall direct the Dispute Accountant to use its best efforts to render its determination within thirty (30) days after the date the Dispute Accountant is selected. The Dispute Accountant’s determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Sellers. The fees and disbursements of the Dispute Accountant shall be paid by each party in an amount equal to the total fees and disbursements of the Dispute Accountant multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount in dispute not awarded to such party and the denominator of which is the total amount in dispute. The Working Capital Amount that becomes final and binding on Buyer and Sellers under this Section 2.**6(b)** shall be referred to collectively herein as the “Final Working Capital Amount.” 

2.6.3. If the Final Working Capital Amount differs from the Estimated Working Capital Amount determined at Closing, then a reconciling payment shall be made from one party to the other in a manner that takes into account any adjustments made at Closing. If the Final Working Capital Amount is less than Target Working Capital, then promptly following the determination of the Final Working Capital Amount, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted and Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount of such deficiency less the amount of any Estimated Working Capital Adjustment subtracted from the Base Purchase Price at Closing, or plus the amount of any Estimated Working Capital Adjustment added to the Base Purchase Price at Closing. If the Final Working Capital Amount is more than the Target Working Capital, then promptly following the determination of the Final Working Capital Amount, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted and Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount of such excess plus any amount of any Estimated Working Capital Adjustment subtracted from the Base Purchase Price at Closing, or minus the amount of any Estimated Working Capital Adjustment added to the Base Purchase Price at Closing. Any such payment will be made in immediately available funds by Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, not later than five (5) business days following such determination, and if such payment is to be made by Sellers, shall be paid by Sellers from funds other than any amounts set aside as the Escrow Deposit. In calculating the adjustments provided by **Sections 2.4** and 2.56, it is the intention of the Parties to avoid double-counting of items that would result in an inequitable and unintended benefit to one Party or Parties to the detriment of the other Party or Parties.

The Contingent Payment Form shall designate the client, contract date, and type and percentage of revenue generated for purposes of calculating the Contingent Payments.

^One hundred percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the revenues from Prospective Review Services;

^^**Determination of Claims Review Adjusted EBITDA and Audit Adjusted EBITDA**.

4.5.1 Buyer will consolidate finance/accounting, human resources, administration, corporate property and casualty insurance, liability insurance, and sales/marketing services at the corporate level, and expenses associated with these services shall not be included in the calculation of Claims Review Adjusted EBITDA or Audit Adjusted EBITDA.

4.5.5 Third party out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company, or if it is Merged, the Division, such as print fulfillment and legal fees, and including the consultant fees payable to [[Sellers ]] and Lori Lewis, shall be included as expenses in the calculation of Claims Review Adjusted EBITDA and Audit Adjusted EBITDA at actual cost and shall be allocated between the Claims Review Adjusted EBITDA and Audit Review Adjusted EBITDA as direct expenses where appropriate, or in proportion to the relative percentage of revenues generated by each activity, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties. 

4.5.6 For purposes of calculating Claims Review Adjusted EBITDA and Audit Adjusted EBITDA, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, expenses shall be allocated between Claims Review Adjusted EBITDA and Audit Adjusted EBITDA in proportion to the relative percentage of revenues generated by each activity.

11.1.3 The nondisclosure requirements of this section shall apply to the agents and representatives of Sellers engaged in connection with this Agreement, and Sellers shall ensure that each of their respective agents, representatives, and employees having access to Confidential Information shall, prior to or concurrent with such Person’s receipt thereof, be made aware of the substance of this section. After Closing, Sellers shall not copy or retain copies of any Confidential Information, and will not authorize or permit any third Person to copy or retain copies of any Confidential Information, except to the extent necessary to meet Sellers’ tax reporting obligations or involving their ongoing duties or obligations to perform services for or on behalf of the Company or Buyer. 

11.1.4 Buyer covenants and agrees that all Confidential Information it or any of its representatives obtains while conducting due diligence shall be held in strict confidence, unless Buyer is compelled to disclose the information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of law, and shall not be sold, given, transmitted, or disclosed to any third party without the prior written consent of Company or Sellers’ Representative. The nondisclosure requirements of this section shall apply to all of the agents, representatives, and employees of Buyer, and Buyer shall ensure that each of its agents, representatives, and employees having access to Confidential Information shall, prior to or concurrent with such Person’s receipt thereof, be made aware of the substance of this section. In the event this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, upon Company’s request, Buyer shall return all books, records, contracts, documents, and other material obtained by Buyer from Company, including copies thereof, that are still in Buyer’s possession, or subject to Company’s consent, in lieu of returning the documents, Buyer shall certify to Company that such books, records, contracts, documents, and other material have been destroyed or discarded in a secure manner. Additionally, if this Agreement shall terminate prior to Closing, Buyer agrees that in no instance shall Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer use the Confidential Information given to it by Company to compete, directly or indirectly with the Business, with Company or any of Company’s Affiliates. 

^^**Covenant Not to Compete** 

11.2.1 Noncompetition. For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, each Seller agrees not to compete with Company, Buyer, or any Affiliate of Buyer (including without limitation, HMS) in its conduct of the Business, which means that Sellers shall not engage, directly or indirectly, individually or jointly, in providing any of the services provided as part of the Business anywhere in the United States of America. The phrase “engage, directly or indirectly,” shall mean any of the following: engaging directly or indirectly in any aspect of providing the types of services comprising the Business, including as an employee, officer or director of any Person other than the Company, Buyer, or its Affiliates; or having an interest, directly or indirectly, as owner, partner, shareholder, independent contractor, capital investor, lender, renderer of consultation services or advice, or otherwise, (other than as a holder of less than two percent ([[Percentage 8]]%) of the outstanding stock of a publicly-traded corporation) either alone or in association with others, in the operation of any Person or enterprise engaged in any aspect of providing the types of services comprising the Business. Without limiting the foregoing, the restrictive covenant contained in this section shall prohibit each Seller from being employed by or serving as an independent contractor to any healthcare provider, health plan, insurer, or governmental payor in connection with the provision of any aspect of the types of services comprising the Business for a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date. 

11.2.2 Solicitation. For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, no Seller shall (i) directly or indirectly solicit or attempt to solicit any employee, agent, or representative of Company, Buyer, or any Affiliate of Buyer to leave any of such entities; or (ii) directly or indirectly solicit or attempt to solicit any employee, agent, or representative of Company, Buyer, or any Affiliate of Buyer to become an employee or consultant of any other Person. 

11.2.3 Interpretation of Covenant. Sellers acknowledge that **Sections 11.2.2** and **11.2.3** above are reasonably necessary to protect the value of the goodwill of the Company being sold to Buyer and that the provisions therein are a material and ancillary part of the purchase of the Shares. Sellers agree that the nationwide geographic scope of the covenant not to compete is reasonable because Company has conducted the Business on a nationwide basis. In the event that any provision of this section shall to any extent be held invalid, unreasonable, or unenforceable in any circumstances, the Parties hereto agree that the remainder of this section and the application of such provision of this section to other circumstances shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. If any provision of this section, or any part hereof, is held to be unenforceable because of the scope or duration of or the area covered by such provision, the Parties agree that the court or arbitrator making such determination shall reduce the scope, duration, and/or area of such provisions (and shall substitute appropriate provisions for any such unenforceable provisions) and/or shall delete specific words and phrases, but only to the minimum extent necessary in order to make such provisions enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law, and such modified provisions shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced. 

11.2.4 Extension of Covered Time. If any Seller violates any of the covenants contained in this Section 11.2 and Buyer brings legal action for injunctive or other relief hereunder, Buyer shall not, as a result of the time involved in obtaining the relief, be deprived of the benefit of the full restrictive period of the covenant not to compete. Any violation of this covenant not to compete shall automatically toll and suspend the period of the restraint for the amount of time that the violation continues, provided the Buyer seeks enforcement within ninety (90) days after discovery of the violation. 

^^**Equitable Relief** 

11.3.1 Sellers acknowledge and agree that the covenants and undertakings contained in **Sections 11.1** and 11.2 relate to matters which are of a special, unique, and extraordinary character and that a violation of any of the terms of these sections could cause irreparable injury to Company, Buyer, and their respective Affiliates, the amount of which will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. Therefore, Sellers expressly agree that Buyer, Company, and each of their Affiliates shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order, or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or threatened violation of any of such terms by Sellers and such other Persons as the court shall order. If Company, Buyer, or an Affiliate of Buyer commences a court action against Sellers for such injunctive relief, at the conclusion of the case the prevailing party shall be entitled to a judgment against the non-prevailing party for the reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees the prevailing party incurred as a result of the action. Sellers further acknowledge that the restraints imposed upon them pursuant to **Sections 11.1** and 11.2 are no greater than are reasonably necessary to preserve and protect Buyer’s and Company’s reasonable competitive business interests, and that such restraints will not impose an undue hardship upon Sellers. 

11.3.2 Rights and remedies provided for in this section are cumulative and shall be in addition to rights and remedies otherwise available to the parties under any other agreement or applicable law. 

^^**Notification of Certain Matters**. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing if a Party becomes aware of any development, fact, or condition that (a) is reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect; or (b) causes or constitutes a breach of any agreement or covenant under this Agreement applicable to a Party or any representation or warranty of a Party as of the date of this Agreement to no longer be true in all Material respects.

Buyer Indemnitees may satisfy the notice requirement of this section by giving such notice to the Sellers’ Representative. 

12.1.5 Insurance Offset. Any recovery by an Indemnified Party from an Indemnifying Party hereunder shall be net of any insurance or other proceeds received by the Indemnified Party in connection with such Losses, but shall not be net of any tax loss or other benefits realized by the Indemnified Party.

12.2.1 Except as hereinafter provided in this section, all representations and warranties of each Party contained herein (including the Schedules) and all claims of any Indemnified Party in respect to any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach of any representation or warranty of any Indemnifying Party contained in this Agreement, shall be deemed to have been remade at the Closing and shall survive the Closing and shall expire three (3) years after the Closing Date.

12.3.1 The Indemnified Party shall give notice of the commencement of any legal action or proceeding, or written assertion of a claim, brought by a third party for which indemnification is provided under this (a “Third Party Claim”) to the Indemnifying Party within twenty (20) days following the Indemnified Party’s receipt thereof, together with copies of any complaint, summons, written assertion of such Third Party Claim, or similar document. No claim for indemnification on account of a Third Party Claim shall be made and no indemnification therefore shall be available under this article unless and until the Indemnified Party shall have given initial written notice of its claim to the Indemnifying Party as provided herein. 

12.3.2 Except as hereinafter provided (including Section 12.3.3), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to engage counsel and to defend a Third Party Claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall have furnished notice of its election to defend to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following delivery of a notice of a Third Party Claim, together with a written acknowledgement that the Indemnifying Party is obligated under the terms of this Agreement to provide indemnity with respect to such Third Party Claim (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Notice of Acceptance”).

If the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim within the time provided in Section 12.3.2 hereof, the Indemnified Party shall be free to compromise, defend, and settle the Third Party Claim without prejudice to any of its rights hereunder or under applicable law. In determining whether to accept or reject any settlement proposal, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall act in good faith and with due regard for the reasonable commercial and financial interests of the other. 

12.3.5 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any settlement of, or final judgment with respect to, a Third Party Claim which relates to acts, omissions, conditions, events or other matters occurring both before and after the Closing Date, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in good faith as to the portion of such Third Party Claim as to which such indemnification is payable.

Neither Party shall dispose of, compromise, or settle any claim or action in a manner that is not reasonable under the circumstances and in good faith.

The Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party, upon request, all information reasonably necessary for the Indemnifying Party to evaluate or respond to any claim, investigation, or action relating to the period prior to the Closing Date (in the case Company is the Indemnifying Party), to the period after the Closing Date (in the case Buyer is the Indemnifying Party), or to a claim for indemnification. 

^^**Other Provisions**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Sellers shall not have any right of contribution, indemnification, or similar right (whether at common law, by statute, or otherwise) from or against the Company with respect to any claim arising pursuant to this ; and effective as of the Closing, the Sellers hereby waive and release the Company and its successors and assigns from any such right of contribution, indemnification, or similar right with respect to any claim against the Sellers arising pursuant to this .

^^**Exclusive Remedy**. Except as provided in Section 11.3, the indemnification given by the Parties under this Agreement shall be the Parties’ sole and exclusive remedy, each against the other, with respect to all matters of any kind or nature whatsoever respecting the Business except for any claims arising out of or relating to the fraud or intentional misrepresentation of any Party. 

^^**Exclusions from Losses**. Notwithstanding any provision of this , except with respect to a third party claim that is the subject of indemnification pursuant to this , no Party shall be entitled to indemnification under this with respect to consequential, punitive, and exemplary damages. 

^^**Claims Against Escrow and Right of Set-Off**. Upon issuance of a notice of claim for indemnification to Sellers’ Representative pursuant to Section 12.1.4 of this Agreement, Buyer may give notice of a claim under the Escrow Agreement. If the funds held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement are insufficient to offset Buyer’s reasonable estimate of the amount of the claim and the claim is a type described in Section 12.1.2 (2), then Buyer may also set off the amount of such deficiency against any Contingent Payment otherwise due Sellers pursuant to of this Agreement. The exercise of such right of set-off by Buyer in good faith, whether or not ultimately determined to be justified, will not constitute an event of default under of this Agreement. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise such right of set-off or to give notice of a claim under the Escrow Agreement will constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.
