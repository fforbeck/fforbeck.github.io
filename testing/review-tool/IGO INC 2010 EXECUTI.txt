The Committee, in its sole discretion and on such terms and conditions as it may provide, may delegate all or part of its authority and powers under the Plan to one or more directors, officers and/or managers of the Company. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may amend or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason.
