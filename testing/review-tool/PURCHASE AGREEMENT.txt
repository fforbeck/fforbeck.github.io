In light of the foregoing, the Purchaser covenants and agrees, upon request by the Company, to enter into a written intercreditor agreement (a form of which is in Exhibit E) with other lenders participating in a Bridge Financing pursuant to which the Purchaser’s security interest, as evidenced by the Security Agreement, will rank *pari passu* with the security interests of the other lenders participating in the Bridge Financing. The Company will use its best efforts to obtain the agreement of the other Bridge Lender to increase the asset base for the Intercreditor Agreement to $[[USD Value 5: Number]] million. In the event the Seller cannot obtain such Agreement, the Lacey Loans hereby agrees to substitute its priority with the Purchaser up to the amount of the Purchaser’s indebtedness in the event of a default.
