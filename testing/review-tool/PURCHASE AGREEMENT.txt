^^In order for a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Shareholder Indemnified Party, as applicable (an “**Indemnified Party**”), to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under Section 7.1or Section 7.2 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim by a third party (“**Third Party Claim**”), such Indemnified Party, must notify the indemnifying party (the “**Indemnifying Party”**) in writing of the Third Party Claim within 30 days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within 10 days after the Indemnified Party’s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and conduct and control the defense of such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to observe and receive information regarding the defense of such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand on a basis which would result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that does not include an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party for any liability arising out of such claim or demand or any related claim or demand.

^^In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement other than in respect of, arising out of or involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness after discovery of any such claim to the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of the Losses stated in such notice to the Indemnified Party in the manner set forth in Section 7.4 or, in the case of any notice in which the Losses (or any portion thereof) are estimated, on such later date when the amount of such Losses (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined.

^^**Limitations**.  
^^Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.8, Buyer shall be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 7.2(a) for any breach of the representations and warranties made by Buyer until such time as the total amount of all indemnifiable Losses (including Losses arising from such breach and all other indemnifiable Losses arising from any other breaches of any representations or warranties) that have been suffered or incurred by all of the Paragon Indemnified Parties collectively exceeds $[[USD Value 3]] (the “**Deductible Amount**”). In such event, if the total amount of such indemnifiable Losses exceeds the Deductible Amount, the Paragon Indemnified Parties shall be entitled, in accordance with the provisions in this , to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for all indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.7, in no event shall the aggregate liability of the Buyer pursuant to **Sections 7.2(a)**, (b) or (c) exceed an amount equal to $[[USD Value 4: Number]] (the “**Cap Amount**”). Buyer shall have the right to reacquire Buyer Shares from the Shareholders, if any of such shares are then held, in satisfaction of an indemnification claim with each share being deemed to have the same value per share as of the end of the Closing Date.

^^Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.8, Paragon and Intermezzo shall not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 7.1(a) for any breach of the representations and warranties made by either of them until such time as the total amount of all indemnifiable Losses (including Losses arising from such breach and all other indemnifiable Losses arising from any other breaches of any representations or warranties) that have been suffered or incurred by all of the Buyer Indemnified Parties collectively exceeds the Deductible Amount. In such event, if the total amount of such indemnifiable Losses exceeds the Deductible Amount, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled, in accordance with the provisions in this , to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for all indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.7, in no event shall the aggregate liability of each of Paragon and Intermezzo pursuant to Section 7.1(a), (b) or (c) exceed the Cap. Paragon and Intermezzo shall have the right to satisfy any indemnification claim by tendering to the Buyer Indemnified Parties Buyer Shares which shall be deemed to have a value of the closing price of such shares on the Closing Date. In no event will Paragon and Intermezzo have any liability to pay an indemnification claim that exceeds the value of the Buyer Shares and all payments they have received under this Agreement and the Assignment Agreement, it being understood that Buyer shall have the right to exercise its set-off right for any further amounts under Section 7.6 hereof.

^^**Termination of Indemnification**. The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the second anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that the representations and warranties contained in **Sections 4.1**, 4.3, 4.4, 5.3, and 5.4,shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations (collectively, the “**Survival Period**”). Any claim made by a party hereunder shall be preserved despite the subsequent expiration of the Survival Period and any claim made prior to the expiration of the Survival Period shall survive until final resolution thereof. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, no claim for indemnification under this shall be brought after the end of the Survival Period.

^^**Right to Set-Off**. The Buyer or any of its affiliates may, at their discretion, satisfy the unpaid portion of any of indemnification obligations due them by, to the extent permitted by law, setting-off against any amounts due and owing from the Buyer or any of its affiliates to Paragon and Intermezzo including, without limitation, any Net Receipts Payments or Fixed Payments due under this Agreement or payments due under the Assignment Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that there exists a reasonable and good faith dispute as to whether (i) either of the Shareholders has an indemnification obligation hereunder or (ii) the Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party may enforce its right to set-off under this Section 7.6, then, in each case, the Buyer shall be entitled to place any amounts due and owing to the Shareholders hereunder into a third-party escrow account until such dispute has been fully and finally resolved.

^^**Adjustment to Purchase Price**. All indemnification payments paid pursuant to this shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price or the purchase of the interest in the Note.

^^**Exclusivity**. The right of Paragon, Intermezzo and the Buyer to assert indemnification claims and receive indemnification payments pursuant to this shall be the sole and exclusive right and remedy exercisable by such party with respect to any breach by the other party hereto of any covenant, representation or warranty or otherwise under this Agreement or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the remedies of each such party for fraud in the inducement or criminal acts (as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) by another party shall not be subject to any limitation pursuant to this Agreement.

^^**Determination of Losses**.  
^^Losses payable to an Indemnified Party shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds received by such Indemnified Party on account of such matter. The parties hereto shall seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any indemnifiable matter in the ordinary course of business and to the same extent as they would if such claim were not subject to right of indemnification hereunder. No indemnifying party shall be required to make any payment under this unless and until all claims for insurance have been exhausted and all payments under applicable insurance policies have been paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an insurance recovery is made by an Indemnified Party with respect to any indemnification payment for which an indemnification payment has been made, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the indemnifying party the amount of the insurance recovery, but not more than the amount of such indemnification payment.

^^All indemnification payments payable hereunder shall be reduced by the net amount of any tax benefits inuring to the benefit of the Indemnified Party as a result of the Losses for which the Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification, offset by tax benefits lost due to such payment.
