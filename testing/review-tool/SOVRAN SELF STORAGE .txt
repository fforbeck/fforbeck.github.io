^**Compensation Committee**.  

The Compensation Committee is authorized to conclusively interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan, adopt such rules and regulations for its administration as it may deem advisable, decide all questions arising with respect to its operation, and modify, waive or amend the Plan from time to time as may be equitable, except to the extent such modification, waiver or amendment may deprive a Participant of any rights previously granted under the Plan for a Bonus Year. The Compensation Committee shall annually review the components of the Award Percentage and make such changes as it deems appropriate and advise the Participants of such changes prior to [[Date 1: Date]] of such Bonus Year.

^**Change in Performance Objectives, Etc.**

The Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, may change the Award Percentage or any of its components at any time and from time to time upon notice to the affected Participants by amending **Schedule A**. Any such change shall be effective as of the effective date set forth in the notice except that a change which is not prospective only shall not disadvantage the Participants.

^**Restatement of Audited Financial Statements**.

If a Participant receives a Bonus Award for a Bonus Year and Sovran subsequently restates its audited financial statements for such Bonus Year as a result of misconduct of a Participant, the Award Percentage applicable to such Participant shall, as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, be recalculated based upon the restatement. If such recalculation results in a reduction of the Award Percentage for a Participant for such Bonus Year, such Participant shall promptly repay to Sovran the excess of the Bonus Award paid over the amount due after such recalculation. If an Award Percentage is based in part upon financial statements of another company and such financial statements are restated, the Compensation Committee may, as it deems appropriate, recalculate the Award Percentage of Participants adversely affected.

A Participant's participation in the Plan shall terminate upon termination of his or her employment with Sovran for any reason.

If a Participant's employment with Sovran terminates before the end of a Bonus year he or she will receive no incentive compensation for the Bonus Year unless such termination is due to death, disability, retirement after attaining age 60 or such other reason as the Compensation Committee determines appropriate. In such case, the Compensation Committee shall determine what Bonus Award is appropriate.

^**Headings**.  

The headings in the Plan are for purposes of reference only.

^**Modification or Termination of the Plan**.
