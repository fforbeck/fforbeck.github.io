However, if any one person or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than [[Percentage 1]]% of the total Fair Market Value or total voting power of the stock of the Plan Sponsor, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the ownership of the Plan Sponsor (or to cause a change in the effective control of the Plan Sponsor. An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person, or persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in which the Plan Sponsor acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this Section.

^^there is a change in the effective control of the Plan Sponsor. A change in the effective control of the Plan Sponsor occurs on the date that either:

^^^Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the Plan Sponsor possessing [[Percentage 2: Number]]% or more of the total voting power of the stock of such corporation; or

^^^a majority of members of the Plan Sponsor's board of directors is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Plan Sponsor's board of directors prior to the date of the appointment or election.

^^any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires ownership of assets of the Plan Sponsor that have a gross fair market value equal to or more than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Plan Sponsor immediately prior to such acquisitions. For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Plan Sponsor, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associates with the assets.

If a person, including an entity, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.

In the event of an RSU Holder's death, an RSU Holder's RSUs shall be automatically transferred to the RSU Holder's beneficiary designated in accordance with Section 6.4, or if the RSU Holder did not designate a beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives the RSU Holder, the RSU Holder's legal representatives, heirs or legatees.

^^***Designation of Beneficiary***. Each RSU Holder may designate one or more beneficiaries (who may be designated contingently or successively) to whom the RSU payment is payable in the event of the RSU Holder's death. Each designation will automatically revoke any prior designations by the same RSU Holder. The beneficiary designation shall be in writing on a form prescribed by the Committee. Any beneficiary designation will be effective as of the date on which the written designation is received by the Committee during the lifetime of the RSU Holder. If the RSU Holder does not designate a beneficiary, or if a beneficiary does not survive the RSU Holder, the cash payment (or the portion of the cash payment attributable to a deceased beneficiary) shall be payable to the RSU Holder’s estate.

^^***Redemption of RSUs.*** As of the date an RSU is vested, the Company shall redeem the RSU. In no event shall the redemption of RSUs granted under one RSU Agreement affect the redemption of any RSUs under the same RSU Agreement or any other RSU Agreement or affect the number of RSUs which may be redeemed. Following redemption of all RSUs granted under an RSU Agreement, the RSU Agreement shall be terminated.

^^**Amount of RSU Payment****.** If the RSU Agreement specifies that payment of the RSU shall be made in cash, the Plan Sponsor (or the Affiliated Corporation utilizing the services of the RSU Holder) shall make a cash payment for each RSU equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the RSU is vested, less any withholdings (as determined under Section 6.7). If the RSU Agreement specifies that payment of the RSU shall be made in Shares, the Plan Sponsor (or the Affiliated Corporation utilizing the services of the RSU Holder) shall deliver one Share for each RSU to the RSU Holder, less any withholdings (as determined under Section 6.7). The Plan Sponsor has the right to reduce any payment due under the Plan by any amounts owed by the RSU Holder to the Company. The amount of any cash payment shall be calculated and paid in United States dollars.

^^**Timing of Payment****.** Unless the RSU Agreement provides otherwise, the Plan Sponsor (or the Affiliated Corporation utilizing the services of the RSU Holder) shall make any cash payment in a single sum payment as soon as administratively practicable (in accordance with procedures established by the Committee) after the receipt by the Plan Sponsor of all representations requested by the Committee pursuant to Section 12.1, but in no event later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the calendar year in which the RSU vests. Unless the RSU Agreement provides otherwise, the Plan Sponsor (or the Affiliated Corporation utilizing the services of the RSU Holder) shall deliver any Stock payment as soon as administratively practicable (in accordance with procedures established by the Committee) after the receipt by the Plan Sponsor of all representations requested by the Committee pursuant to Article XI, but in no event later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the calendar year in which the RSU vests.

^^***Change in Control.*** Unless otherwise determined by the Committee (either at the time a RSU is granted or by subsequent action that does not cause adverse tax consequences under Code § 409A), RSUs shall not be subject to accelerated vesting at the time of a Change in Control. Upon the consummation of a Change in Control, any RSU as to which the period for which services are required or other restrictions have not been satisfied (or waived or accelerated) shall be forfeited, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or otherwise continued in effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction.

The Committee shall have the discretion at the time the RSU is granted (or at any time the RSU remains outstanding, if the action subsequent to the grant date does not cause adverse tax consequences under Code § 409A) to structure one or more RSUs so that those RSUs shall automatically accelerate and vest in full upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, whether or not those RSUs are to be assumed in the Change in Control or otherwise continued in effect.

^^***Number of SARs.*** Each SAR Agreement shall state that it covers a specified number of Stock Appreciation Rights, as determined by the Committee.

^^***Stock Price for Determining Appreciation.*** Each SAR Agreement shall state the Fair Market Value of a Share from which appreciation of the SAR will be measured.

^^***Duration of SARs.*** Each SAR Agreement shall state the period of time, determined by the Committee, within which the SAR may be exercised by the SAR Holder (the "SAR Period").

Bacterin International Equity Incentive Plan   6/4/2010

^^***Termination of Services, Death, or Disability.*** The Committee may specify the period, if any, after which an SAR may be exercised following termination of the SAR Holder's services in the SAR Agreement. If the SAR Agreement does not specify the period of time following termination of service during which SARs may be exercised, the time periods in this Subsection shall apply. Once a SAR is granted, the Committee may not change the time period during which a SAR may be exercised following termination of the SAR Holder’s services, unless such a change would not cause additional taxes to be imposed pursuant to Code § 409A.

^^^**Termination for Cause****.** If the services of the SAR Holder are terminated within the SAR Period for Cause, as determined by the Company, the SAR shall thereafter be void for all purposes.

^^^**Disability****.** If the SAR Holder becomes Disabled and terminates services, the SAR may be exercised by the SAR Holder within six months following the SAR Holder's termination of services on account of Disability (provided that such exercise must occur within the SAR Period), but not thereafter. The SAR may be exercised only with respect to the extent the SAR had become exercisable on or before the date of the SAR Holder's termination of services because of Disability.

^^^**Death****.** If the SAR Holder dies during the SAR Period while still performing services for the Company or within the six month period referred to in (ii) above or the three-month period referred to in (iv) below, the SAR may be exercised by those entitled to do so under the SAR Holder's will or by the laws of descent and distribution within six months following the SAR Holder's death, (provided that such exercise must occur within the SAR Period), but not thereafter. The SAR may be exercised only to the extent the SAR had become exercisable on or before the date of the SAR Holder's termination of services because of the SAR Holder’s death.

^^^**Termination for Reasons Other than Cause, Disability or Death****.** If the SAR Holder is no longer employed by the Company or performing services for the Company for any reason other than Cause, Disability or the SAR Holder's death, the SAR may be exercised by the SAR Holder within three months following the date of termination (provided that the exercise must occur within the SAR Period), but not thereafter.

^^***Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights***. Upon vesting in a Stock Appreciation Right, a Participant shall be permitted to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right at any time prior to the date the Stock Appreciation Right expires. The effective date of exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right is the date on which the Company receives notice from the Participant of the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right. Upon the exercise of one or more Stock Appreciation Rights settled in Stock, the Company will issue to the Participant the number of whole Shares determined by dividing (i) the number of Stock Appreciation Rights being exercised, multiplied by the difference in the Fair Market Value of one Share on the exercise date of the Stock Appreciation Right and the Fair Market Value of one Share on the grant date in the Stock Appreciation Right by (ii) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the exercise date. Upon exercise of one or more Stock Appreciation Rights settled in cash, the Company shall make a cash payment to the Participant in an amount equal to the total number of vested Stock Appreciation Rights, multiplied by the difference in the Fair Market Value of one Share on the grant date of the Stock Appreciation Right and the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise, less any withholdings.

^^***Withholding Requirement.*** All payments under the Plan are subject to withholding of all taxes, government mandated social benefit contributions, or other payments required to be withheld which are applicable to the Participant.

^^***Effect of Exercise.*** The exercise or cash-out of a Stock Appreciation Right will result in an equal reduction in the number of Stock Appreciation Rights that were granted.

^^***Change in Control.*** Unless otherwise determined by the Committee (either at the time a SAR is granted or by subsequent action), SARs shall not be subject to accelerated vesting at the time of a Change in Control. Upon the consummation of a Change in Control, any SAR as to which the period for which services are required or other restrictions have not been satisfied (or waived or accelerated) shall be forfeited, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or otherwise continued in effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction.

The Committee shall have the discretion, exercisable either at the time the SAR is granted or at any time while the SAR remains outstanding, to structure one or more SARs so that those SARs shall automatically accelerate and vest in full upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, whether or not those SARs are to be assumed in the Change in Control or otherwise continued in effect.

\centered **STOCK BONUSES AND OTHER COMMON STOCK GRANTS**

The Committee may award Stock Bonuses to such Participants, subject to such conditions and restrictions, as it determines in its sole discretion.

\centered **PERFORMANCE AWARDS**

^^***Performance-Based Awards.*** The Company intends that performance-based Awards to certain Eligible Employees will satisfy the performance-based compensation requirements of Code § 162(m) so that the Company may deduct any compensation paid under the Plan for federal income tax purposes without limitation under Code § 162(m). If any provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement would otherwise frustrate or conflict with such intent, that provision, to the extent possible, shall be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid such conflict.

^^***Grants of Performance-Based Awards.*** The Committee may grant Performance Awards that grant a specific number of Options, SARs, shares of Restricted Stock, or Restricted Stock Units that vest in whole or in part upon satisfaction of specified performance goals. The Committee may also grant Awards that require the Committee to grant a specific number of shares of Stock, Options, SARs, shares of Restricted Stock, or Restricted Stock Units upon satisfaction of specified performance goals. The Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine: (a) the type of performance-based Awards to be made, (b) the time at which performance-based Awards are to be made, (c) the time at which the performance-based Awards vest or shares are granted under performance-based Awards, (d) actual performance against targets for purposes of performance-based Award vesting or granting of Awards, (e) specific weighing of the components of performance-based Award vesting or grants, and (f) establish such other terms under the Plan as the Committee may deem necessary or desirable and consistent with the terms of the Plan. The Committee shall have the full and exclusive right to grant and determine terms and conditions of all performance-based Awards granted under the Plan.

^^***Preestablished Performance Goals.*** The performance criteria for any Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements for “performance-based compensation” under Code § 162(m) shall be a measure based on one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria selected by the Committee and specified at the time the Performance Award is granted. For purposes of this Plan, the term “Qualifying Performance Criteria” shall mean any one or more of the following performance criteria, either individually or in any combination, applied to either the Company as a whole or to a business unit or Affiliated Corporation, either individually or in any combination, and measured either annually or cumulatively over a period of years, on an absolute basis or relative to a pre-established target, to previous years’ results or to a designated comparison group, in each case as specified by the Committee in the performance-based Award: (a) cash flow, (b) earnings per share, (c) earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, (d) return on equity, (e) total stockholder return, (f) share price performance, (g) return on capital, (h) return on assets or net assets, (i) revenue, (j) income or net income, (k) operating income or net operating income, (l) operating profit or net operating profit, (m) operating margin or profit margin, (n) return on operating revenue, (o) return on invested capital, (q) product release schedules, and (r) new product innovation.

^^***Committee Certification.*** Notwithstanding satisfaction of any Qualifying Performance Criteria, the number of Stock, Options, SARs, or RSUs under a performance-based Award to be granted or vested on account of satisfaction of such Qualifying Performance Criteria may be reduced by the Committee on the basis of such further considerations as the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine. The Participant shall not be entitled to vest in or be granted any portion of a performance-based Award until the Committee certifies in writing that the Holder has met his or her specific performance goals and determines the portion of the performance-based Award which is to be vested or granted.

\centered **PLAN ADMINISTRATION**

^^***Committee*****.** The Plan shall be administered by a Committee appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, consisting of not less than two Directors (the "Committee") and, at any time when the Plan Sponsor is a publicly held corporation, consisting solely of outside Directors (within the meaning of Code § 162(m)(4)(C)(i)). The Board of Directors may from time to time remove members from or add members to the Committee, and vacancies on the Committee, howsoever caused, shall be filled by the Board of Directors. At any time when the Plan Sponsor is a publicly held corporation, the Committee shall be so constituted at all times as to permit the Plan to comply with Rule 16b-3 or any successor rule promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") and to permit Awards to comply with the performance based compensation exception of Code § 162(m). Members of the Committee and any subcommittee or special committee shall be appointed from time to time by the Board, shall serve at the pleasure of the Board and may resign at any time upon written notice to the Board.

^^***Committee Meetings and Actions.*** The Committee shall hold meetings at such times and places as it may determine.

The Committee shall determine the form or forms of the agreements with Participants that shall evidence the particular provisions, terms, conditions, rights and duties of the Plan Sponsor and the Participants with respect to Awards granted pursuant to the Plan, which provisions need not be identical except as may be provided herein. The Committee shall have the full and exclusive right to grant and determine terms and conditions of all Awards granted under the Plan. In granting Awards, the Committee shall take into consideration the contribution the Participant has made or may make to the success of the Company or its subsidiaries and such other factors as the Committee shall determine. The Committee may from time to time adopt such rules and regulations for carrying out the purposes of the Plan as it may deem proper and in the best interests of the Company. The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any agreement entered into hereunder in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient and it shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. No member of the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith. The determinations, interpretations and other actions of the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be binding and conclusive for all purposes and on all persons.

^^***Options May Be Assumed.*** In accordance with the provisions of Code § 424(a), the Committee may, in its sole discretion, substitute a new Option for an outstanding option or assume an outstanding option in connection with a Corporate Transaction, without the substitution or assumption being treated as a modification of the existing incentive stock option under Code § 424(h) or a modification of an existing option under Code § 409A. If the new substituted Option or assumed Option is intended to be an Incentive Option, the provisions of this Section apply solely to an Eligible Employee who is providing services to the Company at the time of the substitution or assumption (or a former Eligible Employee within the 3-month period following termination of service). For purposes of this Section, the term “Corporate Transaction” includes: (a) a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization, or liquidation; (b) a distribution (excluding an ordinary dividend or a stock split or stock dividend described in Treas. Reg. § 1.424-1(e)(4)(v)) or change in the terms or number of outstanding shares of such corporation; and (c) any other corporate events prescribed by the Commissioner in published guidance.

^^***Interpretation of Plan.*** The determination of the Committee as to any disputed question arising under the Plan, including questions of construction and interpretation, shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons, including the Company, its shareholders, and all persons having any interest in Options which may be or have been granted pursuant to the Plan. Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock grants, and Stock grants are intended to be excluded from the requirements of Code § 409A as a result of the exception for stock rights and the exception for transfers of property subject to § 83. Restricted Stock Unit grants are intended to be excluded from the requirements of Code § 409A under the short-term deferral exception. To the extent that any provision of the Plan or of any grant Agreement could be interpreted otherwise, the Plan and all grant Agreements shall be interpreted in a manner that ensures all grants are excluded from the requirements of Code § 409A. The Company will amend the Plan as necessary to ensure exclusion of Awards from the requirements of Code § 409A, or to the extent necessary or appropriate, to comply with the requirements of Code § 409A.

Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D)) and shall be effective for all purposes of the Plan and on each outstanding Award.

^^***General Adjustment Rules.*** No adjustment or substitution provided for in this Article shall require the Plan Sponsor to sell a fractional Share under any Award, or otherwise issue a fractional Share, and the total substitution or adjustment with respect to each Award shall be limited by deleting any fractional Share. In the case of any such substitution or adjustment, the aggregate exercise price for the total number of Shares then subject to an Option shall remain unchanged but the exercise price per Share under each such Option shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee to reflect the greater or lesser number of Shares or other securities into which the Stock subject to the Option may have been changed, and appropriate adjustments shall be made to other Awards to reflect any such substitution or adjustment. In the case of any such substitution or adjustment, such Option shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee in accordance with the rules governing modifications, extensions, substitutions and assumptions of stock rights described in Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D).
