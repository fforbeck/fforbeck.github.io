**Re: Letter Agreement of Employment**

Dear Kevin:

This letter agreement (this “Agreement”) sets forth the terms and conditions of your employment, and your employment relationship, with Lerner [[Address 4: Address]]. (the “Company”). Your execution of this Agreement will represent your acceptance of all of the terms set forth below and will supercede any other Letter Agreement of Employment entered into prior to this Agreement.

^**Nature of Agreement and Relationship****.** This Agreement does not represent an employment contract for any specified term. Your employment relationship thus will remain “at-will,” meaning that, subject to the terms hereof, either party to this Agreement may terminate the employment relationship at any time for any lawful reason.

^**Job Title and Duties****.** Your job title will be Executive Vice President, National Sales Leader. You will be expected to devote all of your full time efforts to the performance of the duties and responsibilities normally associated with this position, including those from time-to-time that may be assigned to you by your Supervisor, the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer or the Board of Directors of the Company (or the designee of any of the foregoing).

^**Salary****.** For the 12-month period ending on the last Saturday of each January (the last day of the fiscal year), you will receive a base salary at the rate of $[[USD Value 1: Number]]per annum (“Base Salary”), subject to the remaining provisions of this Section. For the remainder of the current fiscal year starting on the date of this Agreement, your Base Salary will be pro rated based on the number of days remaining in such fiscal year divided by 365. At the Company’s sole discretion, your Base Salary may be increased or decreased based on your performance and the performance of the business. You will be paid in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll policies and practices, with all applicable deductions being withheld from your paychecks.

^**Bonus****.** You will be eligible to participate in the Company’s then current bonus plan, in accordance with its terms and conditions, and to receive performance-based bonuses pursuant to any formula that may be established. For the Company’s current fiscal year, your bonus target for the spring bonus (relating to the Company’s results for the first and second fiscal quarters of each fiscal year) will be [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of your Base Salary and for the fall bonus (relating to the Company’s results for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of each fiscal year) will be [[Percentage 2: Number]]%of your Base Salary. Any bonus will be payable in the month following the last quarter to which that bonus relates. All bonuses are determined at the 

Company’s sole discretion, and the Company has the sole discretion to modify or terminate any bonus plan and that plan will govern your right, if any, to a bonus payment upon termination of your employment.

^**Stock Options and Other Long-Term Incentives****.** You will be eligible to receive awards under stock option, restricted stock or other equity-based long-term incentive plans established by the Company (or an Affiliate) that cover executive officers of the Company. The term “Affiliate” means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity (other than the Company) that controls or is controlled by the Company, whether directly or indirectly, such as a parent company or subsidiary. All equity awards described in this paragraph are determined at the Company’s sole discretion, and the Company has the sole discretion to modify or terminate any stock option, restricted stock or other equity-based long-term incentive plan and that plan will govern your rights, if any, relating to any equity award(s) you have received, or may be entitled to receive, upon termination of your employment.

^**Employee Benefits****.** You will be entitled to participate in all employee benefits plans, practices and programs maintained by the Company and made available to senior executives generally and as may be in effect from time to time (the “Benefits Plans”). Your participation in the Benefits Plans will be on the same basis and terms as are applicable to senior executives of the Company generally. Benefits Plans include, but are not limited to, savings and retirement plans, deferred compensation, health and prescription drug benefits, disability benefits, other insurance programs, vacation and other leave, merchandise discounts and business expense procedures. Plan documents setting forth terms of certain of the Benefits Plans are available upon request, which plan documents control all questions of interpretation concerning applicable Benefits Plans, including your rights, if any, upon termination of your employment. The Benefits Plans are subject to modification or termination by the Company at any time, at its sole discretion, in accordance with their terms.

^**Severance Pay****.** Upon your termination of employment by the Company and all Affiliates without Cause (as defined below), but subject to your performance of all post-employment obligations set forth in this Agreement and also subject to your signing a release of claims in a form acceptable to the Company, you will be entitled to receive severance pay for twelve (12) month “Severance Period” at your final Base Salary (“Severance Pay”), beginning the first pay period following your separation date and ending upon the earlier of: (i) your receipt of 52such payments or (ii) your first day of employment with another employer, whichever is earlier. If you obtain employment at an annual salary that is lower than your final Base Salary, you will continue to receive the differential between the two rates of pay for the balance of the 52 weeks. This Severance Pay, which will be subject to applicable deductions required by law, will be paid on the Company’s regular payroll dates for the balance of the twelve (12) month “Severance Periodfollowing your termination date, as outlined above. For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” means: (i) your wrongful misappropriation of the Company’s or an Affiliate’s assets of a material value; (ii) any physical or mental impairment that renders you incapable of performing the essential functions of your position with reasonable accommodations; (iii) your conviction of, or pleading “guilty” or “no contest” to, a felony; (iv) your intentionally causing the Company or an Affiliate to violate a material local state or federal law in any material respect; (v) your willful refusal to comply with a significant, lawful and proper policy, directive or decision of your supervisor or the Board in furtherance of a legitimate business purpose or your willful refusal to perform the duties reasonably assigned to you consistent with your functions, duties and responsibilities, in each case, in any material respect, and only if not remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the Company; or (vi) your breach of this Agreement, in any material respect, not remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the Company.

^**Non-Solicitation****.** Regardless of whether you are eligible to receive Severance Pay,you agree that, if your employment with the Company ends for any reason, you will not, for a period of eighteen (18) months following such termination of employment, (i) directly or indirectly, either for yourself or for any other person, business, company or entity, hire from the Company or any Affiliate, or attempt to hire, divert or take away from the Company or any Affiliate, any of the then current officers or employees of the Company or any Affiliate, (ii) interfere with or harm, or attempt to interfere with or harm, the relationship of the Company or any Affiliate with any person who at any time was an employee, customer or supplier of the Company or any Affiliate or otherwise had a business relationship with the Company or any Affiliate, or (iii) unless compelled by law to do so, directly or indirectly, knowingly make any statement or other communication that impugns or attacks the reputation or character of the Company or any Affiliate, or damages the goodwill of the Company or any Affiliate, or knowingly take any action, directly or indirectly, that would interfere with any contractual or customer or supplier relationships of the Company or any Affiliate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, your beneficial ownership after your termination of employment with the Company, either individually or as a member of a group, of not more than two percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the voting stock of any publicly held corporation shall not be a violation of this provision.

^**Remedies****.** You acknowledge that money will not adequately compensate the Company for the substantial damages that will arise upon the breach of any provision of Sections 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement and that the Company would have no adequate remedy at law. For this reason, any claim the Company may make that you have breached or are threatening to breach Sections 8, 9, or 10 is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 14. Instead, if you breach or threaten to breach any provision of Sections 8, 9 or 10, the Company will be entitled, in addition to other rights and remedies, to specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable relief to prevent or restrain any breach or threatened breach of Sections 8, 9 or 10. The Company may obtain such relief from (i) any court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) an arbitrator acting pursuant to Section 14 hereof, or (iii) a combination of the two (e.g., by simultaneously seeking arbitration under Section 14 and a temporary injunction from a court pending the outcome of the arbitration). It shall be the Company’s sole and exclusive right to elect which approach to use to vindicate its rights. You also agree that in the event of a breach (or any threat of breach) the Company shall be entitled to obtain an immediate injunction and restraining order to prevent such breach and/or threatened breach and/or continued breach, without having to prove damages, and to obtain all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. In addition, the existence of any claim or cause of action by you against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of the restrictive covenants of this Agreement.

^**Acknowledgment of Reasonableness****.** You and the Company specifically agree that the provisions of the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement, including the post-employment covenants regarding non-solicitation and non-competition, are reasonable and that the Company would not have entered into this Agreement but for the inclusion of such covenants. You understand that the Company’s business is nationwide, and, therefore, a nationwide restrictive covenant is reasonable. If a court or arbitrator determines that any provision of any such restrictive covenant is unreasonable, whether in period of time, geographical area, or otherwise, you and the Company agree that the covenant shall be interpreted and enforced to the maximum extent which a court or arbitrator deems reasonable. In addition, you and the Company authorize any such court or arbitrator to reform these restrictions to the minimum extent necessary.

^**Company Property****.**  Upon your termination of employment for any reason, you will promptly return to the Company all Company-related documents and Company property within your possession or control.

^**Arbitration of Disputes****.** Except as set forth in Section 11, any dispute, claim or difference arising out of or in relation to your employment will be settled exclusively by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes before a single arbitrator.

The arbitration will be held in [[Address 5: Address]] unless you and the Company (each a “Party,” and jointly, the “Parties”) mutually agree otherwise. To the extent permitted by law, each Party will bear its own costs and fees of the arbitration, and other fees and expenses of the arbitrator will be borne equally by the Parties; *provided*, *however*, that the arbitrator will be empowered to require any one or more of the Parties to bear all or any portion of fees and expenses of the Parties and/or the fees and expenses of the arbitrator in the event that the arbitrator determines such Party has acted in bad faith. The arbitrator will have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of the State of [[Address 6: Address]] or grant. The decision and award of the arbitrator will be binding on all Parties. Either Party to the arbitration may seek to have the ruling of the arbitrator entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each Party agrees that it will not file suit, motion, petition or otherwise commence any legal action or proceeding for any matter which is required to be submitted to arbitration as contemplated herein, except in connection with the enforcement of an award rendered by an arbitrator and except to seek the issuance of an injunction or temporary restraining order pending a final determination by the arbitrator.

You also agree to notify the Chief Executive Officer or his designee immediately after being contacted by any member of the media with respect to any matter affected by this section.
