^^^ \centered (d) This Instrument constitutes a financing statement with respect to any part of the Mortgaged Property that is or may become a Fixture, if permitted by applicable law. 
^^ \centered 3. **ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS; APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER; LENDER IN POSSESSION.** 
^^^ \centered (a) As part of the consideration for the Indebtedness, Borrower absolutely and unconditionally assigns and transfers to Lender all Rents. It is the intention of Borrower to establish a present, absolute and irrevocable transfer and assignment to Lender of all Rents and to authorize and empower Lender to collect and receive all Rents without the necessity of further action on the part of Borrower. Promptly upon request by Lender, Borrower agrees to execute and deliver such further assignments as Lender may from time to time require. Borrower and Lender intend this assignment of Rents to be immediately effective and to constitute an absolute present assignment and not an assignment for additional security only. For purposes of giving effect to this absolute assignment of Rents, and for no other purpose, Rents shall not be deemed to be a part of the Mortgaged Property. However, if this present, absolute and unconditional assignment of Rents is not enforceable by its terms under the laws of the Property Jurisdiction, then the Rents shall be included as a part of the Mortgaged Property and it is the intention of the Borrower that in this circumstance this Instrument create and perfect a lien on Rents in favor of Lender, which lien shall be effective as of the date of this Instrument. 
^^^ \centered (b) After the occurrence of an Event of Default, Borrower authorizes Lender to collect, sue for and compromise Rents and directs each tenant of the Mortgaged Property to pay all Rents to, or as directed by, Lender. However, until the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender hereby grants to Borrower a revocable license to collect and receive all Rents, to hold all Rents in trust for the benefit of Lender and to apply all Rents to pay the installments of interest and principal then due and payable under the Note and the other amounts then due and payable under the other Loan Documents, including Imposition Deposits, and to pay the current costs and expenses of managing, operating and maintaining the Mortgaged Property, including utilities, Taxes and insurance premiums (to the extent not included in Imposition Deposits), tenant improvements and other capital expenditures. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Rents remaining after application pursuant to the preceding sentence may be retained by Borrower free and clear of, and released from, Lender's rights with respect to Rents under this Instrument. From and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and without the necessity of Lender entering upon and taking and maintaining control of the Mortgaged Property directly, or by a receiver, Borrower's license to collect Rents shall automatically terminate and Lender shall without Notice be entitled to all Rents as they become due and payable, including Rents then due and unpaid. Borrower shall pay to Lender upon demand all Rents to which Lender is entitled. At any time on or after the date of Lender's demand for Rents, (i) Lender may give, and Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Lender to give, notice to all tenants of the Mortgaged Property instructing them to pay all Rents to Lender, (ii) no tenant shall be obligated to inquire further as to the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default, and (iii) no tenant shall be obligated to pay to Borrower any amounts which are actually paid to Lender in response to such a notice. Any such notice by Lender shall be delivered to each tenant personally, by mail or by delivering such demand to each rental unit. Borrower shall not interfere with and shall cooperate with Lender's collection of such Rents. 
^^^ \centered (c) Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that Borrower has not executed any prior assignment of Rents (other than an assignment of Rents securing any prior indebtedness that is being assigned to Lender, or paid off and discharged with the proceeds of the loan evidenced by the Note), that Borrower has not performed, and Borrower covenants and agrees that it will not perform, any acts and has not executed, and shall not execute, any instrument which would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this Section 3, and that at the time of execution of this Instrument there has been no anticipation or prepayment of any Rents for more than two months prior to the due dates of such Rents. Borrower shall not collect or accept payment of any Rents more than two months prior to the due dates of such Rents. 
^^^ \centered (d) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender may, regardless of the adequacy of Lender's security or the solvency of Borrower and even in the absence of waste, enter upon and take and maintain full control of the Mortgaged Property in order to perform all acts that Lender in its discretion determines to be necessary or desirable for the operation and maintenance of the Mortgaged Property, including the execution, cancellation or modification of Leases, the collection of all Rents, the making of repairs to the Mortgaged Property and the execution or termination of contracts providing for the management, operation or maintenance of the Mortgaged Property, for the purposes of enforcing the assignment of Rents pursuant to Section 3(a), protecting the Mortgaged Property or the security of this Instrument, or for such other purposes as Lender in its discretion may deem necessary or desirable. Alternatively, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, regardless of the adequacy of Lender's security, without regard to Borrower's solvency and without the necessity of giving prior notice (oral or written) to Borrower, Lender may apply to any court having jurisdiction for the appointment of a receiver for the Mortgaged Property to take any or all of the actions set forth in the preceding sentence. If Lender elects to seek the appointment of a receiver for the Mortgaged Property at any time after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower, by its execution of this Instrument, expressly consents to the appointment of such receiver, including the appointment of a receiver *ex parte* if permitted by applicable law. If Borrower is a housing cooperative corporation or association, Borrower hereby agrees that if a receiver is appointed, the order appointing the receiver may contain a provision requiring the receiver to pay the installments of interest and principal then due and payable under the Note and the other amounts then due and payable under the other Loan Documents, including Imposition Deposits, it being acknowledged and agreed that the Indebtedness is an obligation of the Borrower and must be paid out of maintenance charges payable by the Borrower's tenant shareholders under their proprietary leases or occupancy agreements. Lender or the receiver, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive a reasonable fee for managing the Mortgaged Property. Immediately upon appointment of a receiver or immediately upon the Lender's entering upon and taking possession and control of the Mortgaged Property, Borrower shall surrender possession of the Mortgaged Property to Lender or the receiver, as the case may be, and shall deliver to Lender or the receiver, as the case may be, all documents, records (including records on electronic or magnetic media), accounts, surveys, plans, and specifications relating to the Mortgaged Property and all security deposits and prepaid Rents. In the event Lender takes possession and control of the Mortgaged Property, Lender may exclude Borrower and its representatives from the Mortgaged Property. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the exercise by Lender of any of the rights conferred under this Section 3 shall not be construed to make Lender a mortgagee-in-possession of the Mortgaged Property so long as Lender has not itself entered into actual possession of the Land and Improvements. 
^^^ \centered (e) If Lender enters the Mortgaged Property, Lender shall be liable to account only to Borrower and only for those Rents actually received. Except to the extent of Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Lender shall not be liable to Borrower, anyone claiming under or through Borrower or anyone having an interest in the Mortgaged Property, by reason of any act or omission of Lender under Section 3(d), and Borrower hereby releases and discharges Lender from any such liability to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
^^^ \centered (f) If the Rents are not sufficient to meet the costs of taking control of and managing the Mortgaged Property and collecting the Rents, any funds expended by Lender for such purposes shall become an additional part of the Indebtedness as provided in Section 12.  
^^^ \centered (g) Any entering upon and taking of control of the Mortgaged Property by Lender or the receiver, as the case may be, and any application of Rents as provided in this Instrument shall not cure or waive any Event of Default or invalidate any other right or remedy of Lender under applicable law or provided for in this Instrument. 
^^ \centered 4. **ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES; LEASES AFFECTING THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY.** 
^^^ \centered (a) As part of the consideration for the Indebtedness, Borrower absolutely and unconditionally assigns and transfers to Lender all of Borrower's right, title and interest in, to and under the Leases, including Borrower's right, power and authority to modify the terms of any such Lease, or extend or terminate any such Lease. It is the intention of Borrower to establish a present, absolute and irrevocable transfer and assignment to Lender of all of Borrower's right, title and interest in, to and under the Leases. Borrower and Lender intend this assignment of the Leases to be immediately effective and to constitute an absolute present assignment and not an assignment for additional security only. For purposes of giving effect to this absolute assignment of the Leases, and for no other purpose, the Leases shall not be deemed to be a part of the Mortgaged Property. However, if this present, absolute and unconditional assignment of the Leases is not enforceable by its terms under the laws of the Property Jurisdiction, then the Leases shall be included as a part of the Mortgaged Property and it is the intention of the Borrower that in this circumstance this Instrument create and perfect a lien on the Leases in favor of Lender, which lien shall be effective as of the date of this Instrument. 
^^^ \centered (b) Until Lender gives Notice to Borrower of Lender's exercise of its rights under this Section 4, Borrower shall have all rights, power and authority granted to Borrower under any Lease (except as otherwise limited by this Section or any other provision of this Instrument), including the right, power and authority to modify the terms of any Lease or extend or terminate any Lease. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the permission given to Borrower pursuant to the preceding sentence to exercise all rights, power and authority under Leases shall automatically terminate. Borrower shall comply with and observe Borrower's obligations under all Leases, including Borrower's obligations pertaining to the maintenance and disposition of tenant security deposits. 
^^^ \centered (c) Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the exercise by Lender, either directly or by a receiver, of any of the rights conferred under this Section 4 shall not be construed to make Lender a mortgagee-in-possession of the Mortgaged Property so long as Lender has not itself entered into actual possession of the Land and the Improvements. The acceptance by Lender of the assignment of the Leases pursuant to Section 4(a) shall not at any time or in any event obligate Lender to take any action under this Instrument or to expend any money or to incur any expenses. Except to the extent of Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Lender shall not be liable in any way for any injury or damage to person or property sustained by any person or persons, firm or corporation in or about the Mortgaged Property. Prior to Lender's actual entry into and taking possession of the Mortgaged Property, Lender shall not (i) be obligated to perform any of the terms, covenants and conditions contained in any Lease (or otherwise have any obligation with respect to any Lease); (ii) be obligated to appear in or defend any action or proceeding relating to the Lease or the Mortgaged Property; or (iii) be responsible for the operation, control, care, management or repair of the Mortgaged Property or any portion of the Mortgaged Property. The execution of this Instrument by Borrower shall constitute conclusive evidence that all responsibility for the operation, control, care, management and repair of the Mortgaged Property is and shall be that of Borrower, prior to such actual entry and taking of possession. 
^^^ \centered (d) Upon delivery of Notice by Lender to Borrower of Lender's exercise of Lender's rights under this Section 4 at any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and without the necessity of Lender entering upon and taking and maintaining control of the Mortgaged Property directly, by a receiver, or by any other manner or proceeding permitted by the laws of the Property Jurisdiction, Lender immediately shall have all rights, powers and authority granted to Borrower under any Lease, including the right, power and authority to modify the terms of any such Lease, or extend or terminate any such Lease. 
^^^ \centered (e) Borrower shall, promptly upon Lender's request, deliver to Lender an executed copy of each residential Lease then in effect. All Leases for residential dwelling units shall be on forms approved by Lender, shall be for initial terms of at least six months and not more than two years, and shall not include options to purchase. 
^^^ \centered (f) Borrower shall not lease any portion of the Mortgaged Property for non-residential use except with the prior written consent of Lender and Lender's prior written approval of the Lease agreement. Borrower shall not modify the terms of, or extend or terminate, any Lease for non-residential use (including any Lease in existence on the date of this Instrument) without the prior written consent of Lender. However, Lender's consent shall not be required for the modification or extension of a non-residential Lease if such modification or extension is on terms at least as favorable to Borrower as those customary at that time in the applicable market and the income from the extended or modified Lease will not be less than the income received from the Lease as of the date of this Instrument. Borrower shall, without request by Lender, deliver an executed copy of each non-residential Lease to Lender promptly after such Lease is signed. All non-residential Leases, including renewals or extensions of existing Leases, shall specifically provide that (i) such Leases are subordinate to the lien of this Instrument; (ii) the tenant shall attorn to Lender and any purchaser at a foreclosure sale, such attornment to be self-executing and effective upon acquisition of title to the Mortgaged Property by any purchaser at a foreclosure sale or by Lender in any manner; (iii) the tenant agrees to execute such further evidences of attornment as Lender or any purchaser at a foreclosure sale may from time to time request; (iv) the Lease shall not be terminated by foreclosure or any other transfer of the Mortgaged Property; (v) after a foreclosure sale of the Mortgaged Property, Lender or any other purchaser at such foreclosure sale may, at Lender's or such purchaser's option, accept or terminate such Lease; and (vi) the tenant shall, upon receipt after the occurrence of an Event of Default of a written request from Lender, pay all Rents payable under the Lease to Lender. 
^^^ \centered (g) Borrower shall not receive or accept Rent under any Lease (whether residential or non-residential) for more than two months in advance. 
^^^ \centered (h) If Borrower is a cooperative housing corporation or association, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subsection or in Section 21, so long as Borrower remains a cooperative housing corporation or association and is not in breach of any covenant of this Instrument, Lender hereby consents to: 
^^^^ \centered (i) the execution of leases of apartments for a term in excess of two years from Borrower to a tenant shareholder of Borrower, so long as such leases, including proprietary leases, are and will remain subordinate to the lien of this Instrument; and 
^^^^ \centered (ii) the surrender or termination of such leases of apartments where the surrendered or terminated lease is immediately replaced or where the Borrower makes its best efforts to secure such immediate replacement by a newly executed lease of the same apartment to a tenant shareholder of the Borrower. However, no consent is hereby given by Lender to any execution, surrender, termination or assignment of a lease under terms that would waive or reduce the obligation of the resulting tenant shareholder under such lease to pay cooperative assessments in full when due or the obligation of the former tenant shareholder to pay any unpaid portion of such assessments. 
^^ \centered 5. **PAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS; PERFORMANCE UNDER LOAN DOCUMENTS; PREPAYMENT PREMIUM.** Borrower shall pay the Indebtedness when due in accordance with the terms of the Note and the other Loan Documents and shall perform, observe and comply with all other provisions of the Note and the other Loan Documents. Borrower shall pay a prepayment premium in connection with certain prepayments of the Indebtedness, including a payment made after Lender's exercise of any right of acceleration of the Indebtedness, as provided in the Note. 
^^ \centered 6. **EXCULPATION.** Borrower's personal liability for payment of the Indebtedness and for performance of the other obligations to be performed by it under this Instrument is limited in the manner, and to the extent, provided in the Note.  
^^ \centered 7. **DEPOSITS FOR TAXES, INSURANCE AND OTHER CHARGES.**  
^^^ \centered (a) Unless this requirement is waived in writing by Lender, which waiver may be contained in this Section 7(a), Borrower shall deposit with Lender on the day monthly installments of principal or interest, or both, are due under the Note (or on another day designated in writing by Lender), until the Indebtedness is paid in full, an additional amount sufficient to accumulate with Lender the entire sum required to pay, when due, the items marked "Collect" below. Lender will not require the Borrower to make Imposition Deposits with respect to the items marked "Deferred" below. 
[Deferred] Hazard Insurance premiums or other insurance premiums required by Lender under Section 19,

[Deferred] Taxes, 

[Deferred] water and sewer charges (that could become a lien on the Mortgaged Property),

[ N/A ] ground rents, 

[Deferred] assessments or other charges (that could become a lien on the Mortgaged Property)

The amounts deposited under the preceding sentence are collectively referred to in this Instrument as the "**Imposition Deposits**." The obligations of Borrower for which the Imposition Deposits are required are collectively referred to in this Instrument as "**Impositions.**" The amount of the Imposition Deposits shall be sufficient to enable Lender to pay each Imposition before the last date upon which such payment may be made without any penalty or interest charge being added. Lender shall maintain records indicating how much of the monthly Imposition Deposits and how much of the aggregate Imposition Deposits held by Lender are held for the purpose of paying Taxes, insurance premiums and each other Imposition. 

^^^ \centered (b) Imposition Deposits shall be held in an institution (which may be Lender, if Lender is such an institution) whose deposits or accounts are insured or guaranteed by a federal agency. Lender shall not be obligated to open additional accounts or deposit Imposition Deposits in additional institutions when the amount of the Imposition Deposits exceeds the maximum amount of the federal deposit insurance or guaranty. Lender shall apply the Imposition Deposits to pay Impositions so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Unless applicable law requires, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest, earnings or profits on the Imposition Deposits. As additional security for all of Borrower's obligations under this Instrument and the other Loan Documents, Borrower hereby pledges and grants to Lender a security interest in the Imposition Deposits and all proceeds of, and all interest and dividends on, the Imposition Deposits. Any amounts deposited with Lender under this Section 7 shall not be trust funds, nor shall they operate to reduce the Indebtedness, unless applied by Lender for that purpose under Section 7(e). 
^^^ \centered (c) If Lender receives a bill or invoice for an Imposition, Lender shall pay the Imposition from the Imposition Deposits held by Lender. Lender shall have no obligation to pay any Imposition to the extent it exceeds Imposition Deposits then held by Lender. Lender may pay an Imposition according to any bill, statement or estimate from the appropriate public office or insurance company without inquiring into the accuracy of the bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of the Imposition. 
^^^ \centered (d) If at any time the amount of the Imposition Deposits held by Lender for payment of a specific Imposition exceeds the amount reasonably deemed necessary by Lender, the excess shall be credited against future installments of Imposition Deposits. If at any time the amount of the Imposition Deposits held by Lender for payment of a specific Imposition is less than the amount reasonably estimated by Lender to be necessary, Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount of the deficiency within 15 days after Notice from Lender.  
^^^ \centered (e) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender may apply any Imposition Deposits, in any amounts and in any order as Lender determines, in Lender's discretion, to pay any Impositions or as a credit against the Indebtedness. Upon payment in full of the Indebtedness, Lender shall refund to Borrower any Imposition Deposits held by Lender. 
^^^ \centered (f) If Lender does not collect an Imposition Deposit with respect to an Imposition either marked "Deferred" in Section 7(a) or pursuant to a separate written waiver by Lender, then on or before the date each such Imposition is due, or on the date this Instrument requires each such Imposition to be paid, Borrower must provide Lender with proof of payment of each such Imposition for which Lender does not require collection of Imposition Deposits. Lender may revoke its deferral or waiver and require Borrower to deposit with Lender any or all of the Imposition Deposits listed in Section 7(a), regardless of whether any such item is marked "Deferred" in such section, upon Notice to Borrower, (i) if Borrower does not timely pay any of the Impositions, (ii) if Borrower fails to provide timely proof to Lender of such payment, or (iii) at any time during the existence of an Event of Default.  
^^^ \centered (g) In the event of a Transfer prohibited by or requiring Lender's approval under Section 21, Lender's waiver of the collection of any Imposition Deposit in this Section 7 may be modified or rendered void by Lender at Lender's option by Notice to Borrower and the transferee(s) as a condition of Lender's approval of such Transfer. 
^^ \centered 8. **COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS.** Borrower shall deposit with Lender such amounts as may be required by any Collateral Agreement and shall perform all other obligations of Borrower under each Collateral Agreement.  
^^ \centered 9. **APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.** If at any time Lender receives, from Borrower or otherwise, any amount applicable to the Indebtedness which is less than all amounts due and payable at such time, then Lender may apply that payment to amounts then due and payable in any manner and in any order determined by Lender, in Lender's discretion. Neither Lender's acceptance of an amount that is less than all amounts then due and payable nor Lender's application of such payment in the manner authorized shall constitute or be deemed to constitute either a waiver of the unpaid amounts or an accord and satisfaction. Notwithstanding the application of any such amount to the Indebtedness, Borrower's obligations under this Instrument and the Note shall remain unchanged. 
^^ \centered 10. **COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS.** 
^^^ \centered (a) Borrower shall comply with all laws, ordinances, regulations and requirements of any Governmental Authority and all recorded lawful covenants and agreements relating to or affecting the Mortgaged Property, including all laws, ordinances, regulations, requirements and covenants pertaining to health and safety, construction of improvements on the Mortgaged Property, fair housing, disability accommodation, zoning and land use, and Leases. Borrower also shall comply with all applicable laws that pertain to the maintenance and disposition of tenant security deposits. 
^^^ \centered (b) Borrower shall at all times maintain records sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Section 10. 
^^^ \centered (c) Borrower shall take appropriate measures to prevent, and shall not engage in or knowingly permit, any illegal activities at the Mortgaged Property that could endanger tenants or visitors, result in damage to the Mortgaged Property, result in forfeiture of the Mortgaged Property, or otherwise materially impair the lien created by this Instrument or Lender's interest in the Mortgaged Property. Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that no portion of the Mortgaged Property has been or will be purchased with the proceeds of any illegal activity. 
^^^ \centered (d) Borrower shall at all times comply with all laws, regulations and requirements of any Governmental Authority relating to Borrower's formation, continued existence and good standing in the Property Jurisdiction. Borrower shall at all times comply with its organizational documents, including but not limited to its partnership agreement (if Borrower is a partnership), its by-laws (if Borrower is a corporation or housing cooperative corporation or association) or its operating agreement (if Borrower is an limited liability company, joint venture or tenancy-in-common ). If Borrower is a housing cooperative corporation or association, Borrower shall at all times maintain its status as a "cooperative housing corporation" as such term is defined in Section 216(b) of the Internal revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any successor statute thereto. 
^^ \centered 11. **USE OF PROPERTY.** Unless required by applicable law, Borrower shall not (a) allow changes in the use for which all or any part of the Mortgaged Property is being used at the time this Instrument was executed, except for any change in use approved by Lender, (b) convert any individual dwelling units or common areas to commercial use, (c) initiate a change in the zoning classification of the Mortgaged Property or acquiesce without Notice to and consent of Lender in a change in the zoning classification of the Mortgaged Property, (d) establish any condominium or cooperative regime with respect to the Mortgaged Property, (e) combine all or any part of the Mortgaged Property with all or any part of a tax parcel which is not part of the Mortgaged Property, or (f) subdivide or otherwise split any tax parcel constituting all or any part of the Mortgaged Property without the prior consent of Lender. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary, if Borrower is a housing cooperative corporation or association, Lender acknowledges and consents to Borrower's use of the Mortgaged Property as a housing cooperative. 
^^ \centered 12. **PROTECTION OF LENDER'S SECURITY; INSTRUMENT SECURES FUTURE ADVANCES.**

^^^ \centered (b) Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 12, or under any other provision of this Instrument that treats such disbursement as being made under this Section 12, shall be secured by this Instrument, shall be added to, and become part of, the principal component of the Indebtedness, shall be immediately due and payable and shall bear interest from the date of disbursement until paid at the "**Default Rate**," as defined in the Note. 
^^^ \centered (c) Nothing in this Section 12 shall require Lender to incur any expense or take any action. 
^^ \centered 13. **INSPECTION.**  
^^^ \centered (a) Lender, its agents, representatives, and designees may make or cause to be made entries upon and inspections of the Mortgaged Property (including environmental inspections and tests) during normal business hours, or at any other reasonable time, upon reasonable notice to Borrower if the inspection is to include occupied residential units (which notice need not be in writing). Notice to Borrower shall not be required in the case of an emergency, as determined in Lender's discretion, or when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 
^^^ \centered (b) If Lender determines that Mold has developed as a result of a water intrusion event or leak, Lender, at Lender's discretion, may require that a professional inspector inspect the Mortgaged Property as frequently as Lender determines is necessary until any issue with Mold and its cause(s) are resolved to Lender's satisfaction. Such inspection shall be limited to a visual and olfactory inspection of the area that has experienced the Mold, water intrusion event or leak. Borrower shall be responsible for the cost of such professional inspection and any remediation deemed to be necessary as a result of the professional inspection. After any issue with Mold, water intrusion or leaks is remedied to Lender's satisfaction, Lender shall not require a professional inspection any more frequently than once every three years unless Lender is otherwise aware of Mold as a result of a subsequent water intrusion event or leak.  
^^^ \centered (c) If Lender or Loan Servicer determines not to conduct an annual inspection of the Mortgaged Property, and in lieu thereof Lender requests a certification, Borrower shall be prepared to provide and must actually provide to Lender a factually correct certification each year that the annual inspection is waived to the following effect:  
Borrower has not received any written complaint, notice, letter or other written communication from tenants, management agent or governmental authorities regarding mold, fungus, microbial contamination or pathogenic organisms ("**Mold**") or any activity, condition, event or omission that causes or facilitates the growth of Mold on or in any part of the Mortgaged Property or if Borrower has received any such written complaint, notice, letter or other written communication that Borrower has investigated and determined that no Mold activity, condition or event exists or alternatively has fully and properly remediated such activity, condition, event or omission in compliance with the Moisture Management Plan for the Mortgaged Property.

If an Event of Default exists, Lender may exercise any rights Lender may have with respect to Imposition Deposits without regard to whether Impositions are then due and payable. Lender shall have no liability to Borrower for failing to pay any Impositions to the extent that (i) any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) insufficient Imposition Deposits are held by Lender at the time an Imposition becomes due and payable or (iii) Borrower has failed to provide Lender with bills and premium notices as provided above.

^^^ \centered (g) Borrower shall pay promptly the costs of any environmental inspections, tests or audits, a purpose of which is to identify the extent or cause of or potential for a Prohibited Activity or Condition ("**Environmental Inspections**"), required by Lender in connection with any foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, or as a condition of Lender's consent to any Transfer under Section 21, or required by Lender following a reasonable determination by Lender that Prohibited Activities or Conditions may exist. Any such costs incurred by Lender (including Attorneys' Fees and Costs and the costs of technical consultants whether incurred in connection with any judicial or administrative process or otherwise) that Borrower fails to pay promptly shall become an additional part of the Indebtedness as provided in Section 12. As long as (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) Borrower has actually paid for or reimbursed Lender for all costs of any such Environmental Inspections performed or required by Lender, and (iii) Lender is not prohibited by law, contract or otherwise from doing so, Lender shall make available to Borrower, without representation of any kind, copies of Environmental Inspections prepared by third parties and delivered to Lender. Lender hereby reserves the right, and Borrower hereby expressly authorizes Lender, to make available to any party, including any prospective bidder at a foreclosure sale of the Mortgaged Property, the results of any Environmental Inspections made by or for Lender with respect to the Mortgaged Property. Borrower consents to Lender notifying any party (either as part of a notice of sale or otherwise) of the results of any Environmental Inspections made by or for Lender. Borrower acknowledges that Lender cannot control or otherwise assure the truthfulness or accuracy of the results of any Environmental Inspections and that the release of such results to prospective bidders at a foreclosure sale of the Mortgaged Property may have a material and adverse effect upon the amount that a party may bid at such sale. Borrower agrees that Lender shall have no liability whatsoever as a result of delivering the results to any third party of any Environmental Inspections made by or for Lender, and Borrower hereby releases and forever discharges Lender from any and all claims, damages, or causes of action, arising out of, connected with or incidental to the results of, the delivery of any of Environmental Inspections made by or for Lender. 
^^^ \centered (h) If any investigation, site monitoring, containment, clean-up, restoration or other remedial work ("**Remedial Work**") is necessary to comply with any Hazardous Materials Law or order of any Governmental Authority that has or acquires jurisdiction over the Mortgaged Property or the use, operation or improvement of the Mortgaged Property, or is otherwise required by Lender as a consequence of any Prohibited Activity or Condition or to prevent the occurrence of a Prohibited Activity or Condition, Borrower shall, by the earlier of (i) the applicable deadline required by Hazardous Materials Law or (ii) 30 days after Notice from Lender demanding such action, begin performing the Remedial Work, and thereafter diligently prosecute it to completion, and shall in any event complete the work by the time required by applicable Hazardous Materials Law. If Borrower fails to begin on a timely basis or diligently prosecute any required Remedial Work, Lender may, at its option, cause the Remedial Work to be completed, in which case Borrower shall reimburse Lender on demand for the cost of doing so. Any reimbursement due from Borrower to Lender shall become part of the Indebtedness as provided in Section 12. 
^^^ \centered (i) Borrower shall comply with all Hazardous Materials Laws applicable to the Mortgaged Property. Without limiting the generality of the previous sentence, Borrower shall (i) obtain and maintain all Environmental Permits required by Hazardous Materials Laws and comply with all conditions of such Environmental Permits; (ii) cooperate with any inquiry by any Governmental Authority; and (iii) comply with any governmental or judicial order that arises from any alleged Prohibited Activity or Condition.

^^^^ \centered (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Borrower in this Section 18;  
^^^^ \centered (ii) any failure by Borrower to perform any of its obligations under this Section 18; 
^^^^ \centered (iii) the existence or alleged existence of any Prohibited Activity or Condition; 
^^^^ \centered (iv) the presence or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials on or under the Mortgaged Property or in any of the Improvements or on or under any property of Borrower that is adjacent to the Mortgaged Property; and 
^^^^ \centered (v) the actual or alleged violation of any Hazardous Materials Law. 
^^^ \centered (k) Counsel selected by Borrower to defend Indemnitees shall be subject to the approval of those Indemnitees. In any circumstances in which the indemnity under this Section 18 applies, Lender may employ its own legal counsel and consultants to prosecute, defend or negotiate any claim or legal or administrative proceeding and Lender, with the prior written consent of Borrower (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) may settle or compromise any action or legal or administrative proceeding. However, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or the interests of Borrower and Lender are in conflict, as determined by Lender in its discretion, Lender shall permit Borrower to undertake the actions referenced in this Section 18 in accordance with this Section 18(k) and Section 18(l) so long as Lender approves such action, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Borrower shall reimburse Lender upon demand for all costs and expenses incurred by Lender, including all costs of settlements entered into in good faith, consultants' fees and Attorneys' Fees and Costs. 
^^^ \centered (l) Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of those Indemnitees who are named as parties to a claim or legal or administrative proceeding (a "**Claim**"), settle or compromise the Claim if the settlement (i) results in the entry of any judgment that does not include as an unconditional term the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to Lender of a written release of those Indemnitees, satisfactory in form and substance to Lender; or (ii) may materially and adversely affect Lender, as determined by Lender in its discretion.  
^^^ \centered (m) Borrower's obligation to indemnify the Indemnitees shall not be limited or impaired by any of the following, or by any failure of Borrower or any guarantor to receive notice of or consideration for any of the following: 
^^^^ \centered (i) any amendment or modification of any Loan Document; 
^^^^ \centered (ii) any extensions of time for performance required by any Loan Document; 
^^^^ \centered (iii) any provision in any of the Loan Documents limiting Lender's recourse to property securing the Indebtedness, or limiting the personal liability of Borrower or any other party for payment of all or any part of the Indebtedness; 
^^^^ \centered (iv) the accuracy or inaccuracy of any representations and warranties made by Borrower under this Instrument or any other Loan Document; 
^^^^ \centered (v) the release of Borrower or any other person, by Lender or by operation of law, from performance of any obligation under any Loan Document; 
^^^^ \centered (vi) the release or substitution in whole or in part of any security for the Indebtedness; and 
^^^^ \centered (vii) Lender's failure to properly perfect any lien or security interest given as security for the Indebtedness. 
^^^ \centered (n) Borrower shall, at its own cost and expense, do all of the following: 
^^^^ \centered (i) pay or satisfy any judgment or decree that may be entered against any Indemnitee or Indemnitees in any legal or administrative proceeding incident to any matters against which Indemnitees are entitled to be indemnified under this Section 18; 
^^^^ \centered (ii) reimburse Indemnitees for any expenses paid or incurred in connection with any matters against which Indemnitees are entitled to be indemnified under this Section 18; and 
^^^^ \centered (iii) reimburse Indemnitees for any and all expenses, including Attorneys' Fees and Costs, paid or incurred in connection with the enforcement by Indemnitees of their rights under this Section 18, or in monitoring and participating in any legal or administrative proceeding. 
^^^ \centered (o) The provisions of this Section 18 shall be in addition to any and all other obligations and liabilities that Borrower may have under applicable law or under other Loan Documents, and each Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under this Section 18 without regard to whether Lender or that Indemnitee has exercised any rights against the Mortgaged Property or any other security, pursued any rights against any guarantor, or pursued any other rights available under the Loan Documents or applicable law. If Borrower consists of more than one person or entity, the obligation of those persons or entities to indemnify the Indemnitees under this Section 18 shall be joint and several. The obligation of Borrower to indemnify the Indemnitees under this Section 18 shall survive any repayment or discharge of the Indebtedness, any foreclosure proceeding, any foreclosure sale, any delivery of any deed in lieu of foreclosure, and any release of record of the lien of this Instrument. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Lender has never been a mortgagee-in-possession of, or held title to, the Mortgaged Property, Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnitees under this Section 18 after the date of the release of record of the lien of this Instrument by payment in full at the Maturity Date or by voluntary prepayment in full. 
^^ \centered 19. **PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE.** 
^^^ \centered (a) Borrower shall keep the Improvements insured at all times against such hazards as Lender may from time to time require, which insurance shall include but not be limited to coverage against loss by fire, windstorm and allied perils, general boiler and machinery coverage, and business interruption including loss of rental value insurance for the Mortgaged Property with extra expense insurance. If Lender so requires, such insurance shall also include sinkhole insurance, mine subsidence insurance, earthquake insurance, and, if the Mortgaged Property does not conform to applicable zoning or land use laws, building ordinance or law coverage. In the event any updated reports or other documentation are reasonably required by Lender in order to determine whether such additional insurance is necessary or prudent, Borrower shall pay for all such documentation at its sole cost and expense. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Lender's insurance requirements may change from time to time throughout the term of the Indebtedness. If any of the Improvements is located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any successor to that agency) as an area having special flood hazards, Borrower shall insure such Improvements against loss by flood. All insurance required pursuant to this Section 19(a) shall be referred to as "**Hazard Insurance**." All policies of Hazard Insurance must include a non-contributing, non-reporting mortgagee clause in favor of, and in a form approved by, Lender. 
^^^ \centered (b) All premiums on insurance policies required under this Section 19 shall be paid in the manner provided in Section 7, unless Lender has designated in writing another method of payment. All such policies shall also be in a form approved by Lender. Borrower shall deliver to Lender a legible copy of each insurance policy (or duplicate original) and Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender a copy of all renewal and other notices received by Borrower with respect to the policies and all receipts for paid premiums. At least 5 days prior to the expiration date of any insurance policy, Borrower shall deliver to Lender evidence acceptable to Lender that the policy has been renewed. If Borrower has not delivered a legible copy of each renewal policy (or a duplicate original) prior to the expiration date of any insurance policy, Borrower shall deliver a legible copy of each renewal policy (or a duplicate original) in a form satisfactory to Lender within 120 days after the expiration date of the original policy. 
^^^ \centered (c) Borrower shall maintain at all times commercial general liability insurance, workers' compensation insurance and such other liability, errors and omissions and fidelity insurance coverages as Lender may from time to time require. All policies for general liability insurance must contain a standard additional insured provision, in favor of, and in a form approved by, Lender. 
^^^ \centered (d) All insurance policies and renewals of insurance policies required by this Section 19 shall be in such amounts and for such periods as Lender may from time to time require, and shall be issued by insurance companies satisfactory to Lender.  
^^^ \centered (e) Borrower shall comply with all insurance requirements and shall not permit any condition to exist on the Mortgaged Property that would invalidate any part of any insurance coverage that this Instrument requires Borrower to maintain. 
^^^ \centered (f) In the event of loss, Borrower shall give immediate written notice to the insurance carrier and to Lender. Borrower hereby authorizes and appoints Lender as attorney‑in‑fact for Borrower to make proof of loss, to adjust and compromise any claims under policies of Hazard Insurance, to appear in and prosecute any action arising from such Hazard Insurance policies, to collect and receive the proceeds of Hazard Insurance, and to deduct from such proceeds Lender's expenses incurred in the collection of such proceeds. This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and therefore is irrevocable. However, nothing contained in this Section 19 shall require Lender to incur any expense or take any action. Lender may, at Lender's option, (i) require a "repair or replacement" settlement, in which case the proceeds will be used to reimburse Borrower for the cost of restoring and repairing the Mortgaged Property to the equivalent of its original condition or to a condition approved by Lender (the "**Restoration**"), or (ii) require an "actual cash value" settlement in which case the proceeds may be applied to the payment of the Indebtedness, whether or not then due. To the extent Lender determines to require a repair or replacement settlement and apply insurance proceeds to Restoration, Lender shall apply the proceeds in accordance with Lender's then-current policies relating to the restoration of casualty damage on similar multifamily properties. 
^^^ \centered (g) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Section 19, as long as no Event of Default, or any event which, with the giving of Notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default, has occurred and is continuing, 
^^^^ \centered (i) in the event of a casualty resulting in damage to the Mortgaged Property which will cost $[[USD Value 2: Number]] or less to repair, the Borrower shall have the sole right to make proof of loss, adjust and compromise the claim and collect and receive any proceeds directly without the approval or prior consent of the Lender so long as the insurance proceeds are used solely for the Restoration of the Mortgaged Property; and 
^^^^ \centered (ii) in the event of a casualty resulting in damage to the Mortgaged Property which will cost more than $[[USD Value 2]] but less than $[[USD Value 3: Number]] to repair, the Borrower is authorized to make proof of loss and adjust and compromise the claim without the prior consent of Lender, and Lender shall hold the applicable insurance proceeds to be used to reimburse Borrower for the cost of Restoration of the Mortgaged Property and shall not apply such proceeds to the payment of sums due under this Instrument. 
^^^ \centered (h) Lender will have the right to exercise its option to apply insurance proceeds to the payment of the Indebtedness only if Lender determines that at least one of the following conditions is met: 
^^^^ \centered (i) an Event of Default (or any event, which, with the giving of Notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default) has occurred and is continuing;  
^^^^ \centered (ii) Lender determines, in its discretion, that there will not be sufficient funds from insurance proceeds, anticipated contributions of Borrower of its own funds or other sources acceptable to Lender to complete the Restoration;  
^^^^ \centered (iii) Lender determines, in its discretion, that the rental income from the Mortgaged Property after completion of the Restoration will not be sufficient to meet all operating costs and other expenses, Imposition Deposits, deposits to reserves and loan repayment obligations relating to the Mortgaged Property; 
^^^^ \centered (iv) Lender determines, in its discretion, that the Restoration will not be completed at least one year before the Maturity Date (or six months before the Maturity Date if Lender determines in its discretion that re-leasing of the Mortgaged Property will be completed within such six-month period); or 
^^^^ \centered (v) Lender determines that the Restoration will not be completed within one year after the date of the loss or casualty. 
^^^ \centered (i) If the Mortgaged Property is sold at a foreclosure sale or Lender acquires title to the Mortgaged Property, Lender shall automatically succeed to all rights of Borrower in and to any insurance policies and unearned insurance premiums and in and to the proceeds resulting from any damage to the Mortgaged Property prior to such sale or acquisition. 
^^^ \centered (j) Unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, any application of any insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness shall not extend or postpone the due date of any monthly installments referred to in the Note, Section 7 of this Instrument or any Collateral Agreement, or change the amount of such installments. 
^^^ \centered (k) Borrower agrees to execute such further evidence of assignment of any insurance proceeds as Lender may require. 
^^ \centered 20. **CONDEMNATION.** 
^^^ \centered (a) Borrower shall promptly notify Lender in writing of any action or proceeding or notice relating to any proposed or actual condemnation or other taking, or conveyance in lieu thereof, of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property, whether direct or indirect (a "**Condemnation**"). Borrower shall appear in and prosecute or defend any action or proceeding relating to any Condemnation unless otherwise directed by Lender in writing. Borrower authorizes and appoints Lender as attorney‑in‑fact for Borrower to commence, appear in and prosecute, in Lender's or Borrower's name, any action or proceeding relating to any Condemnation and to settle or compromise any claim in connection with any Condemnation, after consultation with Borrower and consistent with commercially reasonable standards of a prudent lender. This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and therefore is irrevocable. However, nothing contained in this Section 20 shall require Lender to incur any expense or take any action. Borrower hereby transfers and assigns to Lender all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to any award or payment with respect to (i) any Condemnation, or any conveyance in lieu of Condemnation, and (ii) any damage to the Mortgaged Property caused by governmental action that does not result in a Condemnation.  
^^^ \centered (b) Lender may apply such awards or proceeds, after the deduction of Lender's expenses incurred in the collection of such amounts (including Attorneys' Fees and Costs) at Lender's option, to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or to the payment of the Indebtedness, with the balance, if any, to Borrower. Unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, any application of any awards or proceeds to the Indebtedness shall not extend or postpone the due date of any monthly installments referred to in the Note, Section 7 of this Instrument or any Collateral Agreement, or change the amount of such installments. Borrower agrees to execute such further evidence of assignment of any awards or proceeds as Lender may require.

^^^ \centered (j) any exercise by the holder of any other debt instrument secured by a mortgage, deed of trust or deed to secure debt on the Mortgaged Property of a right to declare all amounts due under that debt instrument immediately due and payable;  
^^^ \centered (k) any voluntary filing by Borrower for bankruptcy protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any reorganization, receivership, insolvency proceeding or other similar proceeding pursuant to any other federal or state law affecting debtor and creditor rights to which Borrower voluntarily becomes subject, or the commencement of any involuntary case against Borrower by any creditor (other than Lender) of Borrower pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code or other federal or state law affecting debtor and creditor rights which case is not dismissed or discharged within 90 days after filing; and 
^^^ \centered (l) any representations and warranties by Borrower in this Instrument which is false or misleading in any material respect. 
^^ \centered 23. **REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.** Each right and remedy provided in this Instrument is distinct from all other rights or remedies under this Instrument or any other Loan Document or afforded by applicable law, and each shall be cumulative and may be exercised concurrently, independently, or successively, in any order.  
^^ \centered 24. **FORBEARANCE.** 
^^^ \centered (a) Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) agree with Borrower, from time to time, and without giving notice to, or obtaining the consent of, or having any effect upon the obligations of, any guarantor or other third party obligor, to take any of the following actions: extend the time for payment of all or any part of the Indebtedness; reduce the payments due under this Instrument, the Note, or any other Loan Document; release anyone liable for the payment of any amounts under this Instrument, the Note, or any other Loan Document; accept a renewal of the Note; modify the terms and time of payment of the Indebtedness; join in any extension or subordination agreement; release any Mortgaged Property; take or release other or additional security; modify the rate of interest or period of amortization of the Note or change the amount of the monthly installments payable under the Note; and otherwise modify this Instrument, the Note, or any other Loan Document. 
^^^ \centered (b) Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy under the Note, this Instrument, or any other Loan Document or otherwise afforded by applicable law, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy, or the subsequent exercise of any right or remedy. The acceptance by Lender of payment of all or any part of the Indebtedness after the due date of such payment, or in an amount which is less than the required payment, shall not be a waiver of Lender's right to require prompt payment when due of all other payments on account of the Indebtedness or to exercise any remedies for any failure to make prompt payment. Enforcement by Lender of any security for the Indebtedness shall not constitute an election by Lender of remedies so as to preclude the exercise of any other right available to Lender. Lender's receipt of any awards or proceeds under Sections 19 and 20 shall not operate to cure or waive any Event of Default. 
^^ \centered 25. **LOAN CHARGES.** If any applicable law limiting the amount of interest or other charges permitted to be collected from Borrower is interpreted so that any charge provided for in any Loan Document, whether considered separately or together with other charges levied in connection with any other Loan Document, violates that law, and Borrower is entitled to the benefit of that law, that charge is hereby reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate that violation. The amounts, if any, previously paid to Lender in excess of the permitted amounts shall be applied by Lender to reduce the principal of the Indebtedness. For the purpose of determining whether any applicable law limiting the amount of interest or other charges permitted to be collected from Borrower has been violated, all Indebtedness which constitutes interest, as well as all other charges levied in connection with the Indebtedness which constitute interest, shall be deemed to be allocated and spread over the stated term of the Note. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, such allocation and spreading shall be effected in such a manner that the rate of interest so computed is uniform throughout the stated term of the Note. 
^^ \centered 26. **WAIVER OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.** Borrower hereby waives the right to assert any statute of limitations as a bar to the enforcement of the lien of this Instrument or to any action brought to enforce any Loan Document. 
^^ \centered 27. **WAIVER OF MARSHALLING.** Notwithstanding the existence of any other security interests in the Mortgaged Property held by Lender or by any other party, Lender shall have the right to determine the order in which any or all of the Mortgaged Property shall be subjected to the remedies provided in this Instrument, the Note, any other Loan Document or applicable law. Lender shall have the right to determine the order in which any or all portions of the Indebtedness are satisfied from the proceeds realized upon the exercise of such remedies. Borrower and any party who now or in the future acquires a security interest in the Mortgaged Property and who has actual or constructive notice of this Instrument waives any and all right to require the marshalling of assets or to require that any of the Mortgaged Property be sold in the inverse order of alienation or that any of the Mortgaged Property be sold in parcels or as an entirety in connection with the exercise of any of the remedies permitted by applicable law or provided in this Instrument. 
^^ \centered 28. **FURTHER ASSURANCES.** Borrower shall execute, acknowledge, and deliver, at its sole cost and expense, all further acts, deeds, conveyances, assignments, estoppel certificates, financing statements or amendments, transfers and assurances as Lender may require from time to time in order to better assure, grant, and convey to Lender the rights intended to be granted, now or in the future, to Lender under this Instrument and the Loan Documents.  
^^ \centered 29. **ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE.** Within 10 days after a request from Lender, Borrower shall deliver to Lender a written statement, signed and acknowledged by Borrower, certifying to Lender or any person designated by Lender, as of the date of such statement, (i) that the Loan Documents are unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if there have been modifications, that the Loan Documents are in full force and effect as modified and setting forth such modifications); (ii) the unpaid principal balance of the Note; (iii) the date to which interest under the Note has been paid; (iv) that Borrower is not in default in paying the Indebtedness or in performing or observing any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Instrument or any of the other Loan Documents (or, if the Borrower is in default, describing such default in reasonable detail); (v) whether or not there are then existing any setoffs or defenses known to Borrower against the enforcement of any right or remedy of Lender under the Loan Documents; and (vi) any additional facts requested by Lender.  
^^ \centered 30. **GOVERNING LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE.** 
^^^ \centered (a) This Instrument, and any Loan Document which does not itself expressly identify the law that is to apply to it, shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Land is located (the "**Property Jurisdiction**").  
^^^ \centered (b) Borrower agrees that any controversy arising under or in relation to the Note, this Instrument, or any other Loan Document may be litigated in the Property Jurisdiction. The state and federal courts and authorities with jurisdiction in the Property Jurisdiction shall have jurisdiction over all controversies that shall arise under or in relation to the Note, any security for the Indebtedness, or any other Loan Document. Borrower irrevocably consents to service, jurisdiction, and venue of such courts for any such litigation and waives any other venue to which it might be entitled by virtue of domicile, habitual residence or otherwise. However, nothing in this Section 30 is intended to limit Lender's right to bring any suit, action or proceeding relating to matters under this Instrument in any court of any other jurisdiction. 
^^ \centered 31. **NOTICE.** 
^^^ \centered (a) All Notices, demands and other communications ("**Notice**") under or concerning this Instrument shall be in writing. Each Notice shall be addressed to the intended recipient at its address set forth in this Instrument, and shall be deemed given on the earliest to occur of (i) the date when the Notice is received by the addressee; (ii) the first Business Day after the Notice is delivered to a recognized overnight courier service, with arrangements made for payment of charges for next Business Day delivery; or (iii) the third Business Day after the Notice is deposited in the United States mail with postage prepaid, certified mail, return receipt requested.  
^^^ \centered (b) Any party to this Instrument may change the address to which Notices intended for it are to be directed by means of Notice given to the other party in accordance with this Section 31. Each party agrees that it will not refuse or reject delivery of any Notice given in accordance with this Section 31, that it will acknowledge, in writing, the receipt of any Notice upon request by the other party and that any Notice rejected or refused by it shall be deemed for purposes of this Section 31 to have been received by the rejecting party on the date so refused or rejected, as conclusively established by the records of the U.S. Postal Service or the courier service.  
^^^ \centered (c) Any Notice under the Note and any other Loan Document that does not specify how Notices are to be given shall be given in accordance with this Section 31. 
^^ \centered 32. **SALE** **OF NOTE; CHANGE IN SERVICER; LOAN SERVICING.** The Note or a partial interest in the Note (together with this Instrument and the other Loan Documents) may be sold one or more times without prior Notice to Borrower. A sale may result in a change of the Loan Servicer. There also may be one or more changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given Notice of the change.All actions regarding the servicing of the loan evidenced by the Note, including the collection of payments, the giving and receipt of Notice, inspections of the Mortgaged Property, inspections of books and records, and the granting of consents and approvals, may be taken by the Loan Servicer unless Borrower receives Notice to the contrary. If Borrower receives conflicting Notices regarding the identity of the Loan Servicer or any other subject, any such Notice from Lender shall govern. 
^^ \centered 33. **SINGLE ASSET BORROWER.** Until the Indebtedness is paid in full, Borrower (a) shall not own any real or personal property other than the Mortgaged Property and personal property related to the operation and maintenance of the Mortgaged Property; (b) shall not operate any business other than the management and operation of the Mortgaged Property; and (c) shall not maintain its assets in a way difficult to segregate and identify. 
^^ \centered 34. **SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS BOUND.** This Instrument shall bind, and the rights granted by this Instrument shall inure to, the respective successors and assigns of Lender and Borrower. However, a Transfer not permitted by Section 21 shall be an Event of Default. 
^^ \centered 35. **JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY.** If more than one person or entity signs this Instrument as Borrower, the obligations of such persons and entities shall be joint and several. 
^^ \centered 36. **RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY.** 
^^^ \centered (a) The relationship between Lender and Borrower shall be solely that of creditor and debtor, respectively, and nothing contained in this Instrument shall create any other relationship between Lender and Borrower. 
^^^ \centered (b) No creditor of any party to this Instrument and no other person shall be a third party beneficiary of this Instrument or any other Loan Document. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, (i) any arrangement (a "**Servicing Arrangement**") between the Lender and any Loan Servicer for loss sharing or interim advancement of funds shall constitute a contractual obligation of such Loan Servicer that is independent of the obligation of Borrower for the payment of the Indebtedness, (ii) Borrower shall not be a third party beneficiary of any Servicing Arrangement, and (iii) no payment by the Loan Servicer under any Servicing Arrangement will reduce the amount of the Indebtedness. 
^^ \centered 37. **SEVERABILITY; AMENDMENTS.** The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Instrument shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. This Instrument contains the entire agreement among the parties as to the rights granted and the obligations assumed in this Instrument. This Instrument may not be amended or modified except by a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought; provided, however, that in the event of a Transfer prohibited by or requiring Lender's approval under Section 21, any or some or all of the Modifications to Instrument set forth in Exhibit B (if any) may be modified or rendered void by Lender at Lender's option by Notice to Borrower and the transferee(s). 
^^ \centered 38. **CONSTRUCTION.** The captions and headings of the Sections of this Instrument are for convenience only and shall be disregarded in construing this Instrument. Any reference in this Instrument to an "Exhibit" or a "Section" shall, unless otherwise explicitly provided, be construed as referring, respectively, to an Exhibit attached to this Instrument or to a Section of this Instrument. All Exhibits attached to or referred to in this Instrument are incorporated by reference into this Instrument. Any reference in this Instrument to a statute or regulation shall be construed as referring to that statute or regulation as amended from time to time. Use of the singular in this Agreement includes the plural and use of the plural includes the singular. As used in this Instrument, the term "including" means "including, but not limited to." 
^^ \centered 39. **DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.** Lender may furnish information regarding Borrower or the Mortgaged Property to third parties with an existing or prospective interest in the servicing, enforcement, evaluation, performance, purchase or securitization of the Indebtedness, including but not limited to trustees, master servicers, special servicers, rating agencies, and organizations maintaining databases on the underwriting and performance of multifamily mortgage loans, as well as governmental regulatory agencies having regulatory authority over Lender. Borrower irrevocably waives any and all rights it may have under applicable law to prohibit such disclosure, including but not limited to any right of privacy. 
^^ \centered 40. **NO CHANGE IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES.** Borrower warrants that (a) all information in the application for the loan submitted to Lender (the "**Loan Application**") and in all financial statements, rent schedules, reports, certificates and other documents submitted in connection with the Loan Application are complete and accurate in all material respects; and (b) there has been no material adverse change in any fact or circumstance that would make any such information incomplete or inaccurate. 
^^ \centered 41. **SUBROGATION.** If, and to the extent that, the proceeds of the loan evidenced by the Note, or subsequent advances under Section 12, are used to pay, satisfy or discharge a Prior Lien, such loan proceeds or advances shall be deemed to have been advanced by Lender at Borrower's request, and Lender shall automatically, and without further action on its part, be subrogated to the rights, including lien priority, of the owner or holder of the obligation secured by the Prior Lien, whether or not the Prior Lien is released. 
^^ \centered 42. **ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE - THIRD PARTY CAP AGREEMENT "CAP COLLATERAL."**  
^^^ \centered (a) If the Note provides for interest to accrue at an adjustable or variable interest rate (other than during the "Extension Period," as defined in the Note, if applicable), then the definition of "Mortgaged Property" shall include the "**Cap Collateral**." The "Cap Collateral" shall mean 
^^^^ \centered (i) any interest rate cap agreement, interest rate swap agreement, or other interest rate-hedging contract or agreement obtained by Borrower as a requirement of any Loan Document or as a condition of Lender's making the Loan (a "**Cap Agreement**"); 
^^^^ \centered (ii) any and all moneys (collectively, "**Cap Payments**") payable pursuant to any Cap Agreement by the interest rate cap provider or other counterparty to a Cap Agreement or any guarantor of the obligations of any such cap provider or counterparty (a "**Cap Provider**"); 
^^^^ \centered (iii) all rights of Borrower under any Cap Agreement and all rights of Borrower to all Cap Payments, including contract rights and general intangibles, whether existing now or arising after the date of this Instrument; 
^^^^ \centered (iv) all rights, liens and security interests or guaranties granted by a Cap Provider or any other person to secure or guaranty payment of any Cap Payment whether existing now or granted after the date of this Instrument;

^^^ \centered (c) So long as there is no Event of Default, Lender or Loan Servicer will remit to Borrower each Cap Payment received by Lender or Loan Servicer with respect to any month for which Borrower has paid in full the monthly installment of principal and interest or interest only, as applicable, due under the Note. Alternatively, at Lender's option so long as there is no Event of Default, Lender may apply a Cap Payment received by Lender or Loan Servicer with respect to any month to the applicable monthly payment of accrued interest due under the Note if Borrower has paid in full the remaining portion of such monthly payment of principal and interest or interest only, as applicable.  
^^^ \centered (d) Following an Event of Default, in addition to any other rights and remedies Lender may have, Lender may retain any Cap Payments and apply them to the Indebtedness in such order and amounts as Lender determines. Neither the existence of a Cap Agreement nor anything in this Instrument shall relieve Borrower of its primary obligation to timely pay in full all amounts due under the Note and otherwise due on account of the Indebtedness. 
^^^ \centered (e) If the Note does not provide for interest to accrue at an adjustable or variable interest rate (other than during the Extension Period) then this Section 42 shall be of no force or effect. 
^^ \centered 43. **ACCELERATION; REMEDIES.** At any time during the existence of an Event of Default, Lender, at Lender’s option, may declare the Indebtedness to be immediately due and payable without further demand, and may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by Maryland law or provided in this Instrument or in any other Loan Document. Borrower acknowledges that the power of sale granted in this Instrument may be exercised by Lender without prior judicial hearing. Lender shall be entitled to collect all costs and expenses incurred in pursuing such remedies, including attorneys’ fees, costs of documentary evidence, abstracts and title reports. 
If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall mail or cause Trustee to mail written notice of sale to Borrower in the manner prescribed by Maryland law. Trustee shall give notice of sale and shall sell the Mortgaged Property according to Maryland law. Trustee may sell the Mortgaged Property at the time and place and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels and in such order as Trustee may determine. Trustee may postpone sale of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property by giving notice of the new date in the manner prescribed by Maryland law.

Trustee shall deliver to the purchaser at the sale, within a reasonable time after the sale, a deed conveying the Mortgaged Property so sold without any express or implied covenant or warranty. The recitals in Trustee’s deed shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of the statements made in those recitals. Subject to Maryland Rule 14-208(a), Trustee shall apply the proceeds of the sale in the following order: (a) to all costs and expenses of the sale, including Trustee’s fees not to exceed [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the gross sale price, attorneys’ fees and costs of title evidence; (b) to the Indebtedness in such order as Lender, in Lender’s discretion, directs; and (c) the excess, if any, to the person or persons legally entitled to the excess.

Borrower hereby assents to the passage of a decree for the sale of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to Lender’s exercise of its rights under this Section.

^^ \centered 44. **RELEASE.** Upon payment of the Indebtedness, Lender or Trustee shall release this Instrument. Borrower shall pay Lender’s or Trustee’s reasonable costs incurred in releasing this Instrument.

^^ \centered 46. **PROTECTIVE PAYMENTS.** Any amounts disbursed by Lender under Section 12, or under any other provision of this Instrument that treats such disbursement as being made under Section 12, shall be immediately due and payable, shall bear interest from the date of disbursement until paid at the "Default Rate", as defined in the Note, and, together with the interest thereon, shall be a lien on the Mortgaged Property and secured by this Instrument. This Section shall supersede Section 12(b). 
^^ \centered 47. **WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY.
