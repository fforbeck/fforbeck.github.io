Securities” thereunder, and Carlyle shall be deemed to be a “Holder” for purposes of such registration rights.

The Company and Carlyle hereby agree to make, no later than the Effectiveness Deadline, any revisions to the Carlyle Warrant acceptable to Carlyle and necessary in order to permit a public distribution thereof, including entering into a customary warrant agreement, appointing a warrant agent and taking such other steps as will be needed to facilitate such a public distribution.
