Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor’s liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Revolving Obligations and would be owed by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under any Loan Document but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving any Loan Party; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, the sole recourse of Administrative Agent and Lenders against any Guarantor in respect of its obligations hereunder shall be (A) in the case of AIG, to the AIG Letter of Credit, (B) in the case of WestView, to the WestView Letter of Credit, (C) in the case of Angelo, to the Angelo Letter of Credit, (D) in the case of Bauguss, to the Bauguss Letter of Credit, (E) in the case of Hill, to the Hill Letter of Credit, and (F) in the case of Rosenbaum, to the Rosenbaum Letter of Credit, and this Guaranty shall not give rise to a general obligation of any Guarantor, it being understood and agreed that, in the event that the proceeds from any Guarantor’s Letter of Credit are insufficient to satisfy the Revolver Obligations in full in cash, such Guarantor shall not be liable for any deficiency. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that such Guarantor has caused such Guarantor’s Letter of Credit to be delivered to Administrative Agent to provide credit support for Guarantor’s obligations hereunder to the extent provided herein and, in the event that Administrative Agent is prevented from making a drawing under such Guarantor’s Letter of Credit that is contemplated hereby as a result of the failure of such Guarantor to cause the timely delivery to Administrative Agent of any required amendments, modifications or supplements to, extensions of, or replacements for such Guarantor’s Letter of Credit, in each case in appropriate form, or as a result of any other circumstance beyond Administrative Agent’s direct control, such Guarantor shall pay on demand to Administrative Agent (without duplication of any amounts drawn by Administrative Agent under such Guarantor’s Letter of Credit) an amount equal to such drawing, which amount shall be held as cash collateral for such Guarantor’s obligations hereunder and shall be applied by Administrative Agent to such obligations at the respective times and in the respective amounts that otherwise would have been applicable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to the terms hereof.
