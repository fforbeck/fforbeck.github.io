Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Body Shop and CV hereby (i) repeats and reaffirms all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties contained in the Financing Agreement and each other Loan Document to which it is now a party and (ii) acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement, for the avoidance of doubt but without in any manner limiting or qualifying any other provision of this Agreement, constitutes a simultaneous grant of a Lien on and security interest in any and all personal property of each of Body Shop and CV to the same extent Liens and security interests are granted by the other Loan Parties in the Existing Loan Documents.

^^Each of Body Shop and CV hereby acknowledges and agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for the all the Obligations under the Financing Agreement and each other Loan Agreement to the same extent and with the same force and effect as if each of Body Shop and CV had originally been a Borrower under the Financing Agreement and had originally executed the same as a Borrower.

^Joinder to Loan Documents by Parent and Rinzi.

^^Parent, pursuant to the Financing Agreement, is liable for all of the obligations as the Borrower under the Financing Agreement and each other Loan Document. From and after the date hereof, Administrative Agent, each Lender, Parent and each other Loan Party hereby agree that Parent shall hereafter be a Guarantor, and not the Borrower, and bound solely as a Guarantor under the terms of the Financing Agreement and each other Loan Document, as if it had been an original signatory as a Guarantor under such Loan Documents.

Rinzi. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Rinzi hereby (i) repeats and reaffirms all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties contained in the Financing Agreement and each other Loan Document to which it is now a party and (ii) acknowledges and agrees that, for the avoidance of doubt but without in any manner limiting or qualifying any other provision of this Agreement, the grant of a Lien on and security interest in any and all personal property of Parent and Rinzi, respectively, to the same extent Liens and security interests are granted in the Existing Loan Documents.

^^Each of Parent and Rinzi hereby acknowledges and agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for the all the Guaranteed Obligations under the Financing Agreement to the same extent and with the same force and effect as if Parent and Rinzi had originally been a Guarantor under the Financing Agreement and had originally executed the same as such a Guarantor.

^Reaffirmation. Each Loan Party, as debtor, grantor, mortgagor, pledgor, guarantor, assignor, or in other similar capacities in which such Person grants liens or security interests in its properties or otherwise acts as an accommodation party or guarantor, as the case may be, in any case under the Existing Loan Documents, hereby ratifies and reaffirms all of its payment, performance and observance obligations, contingent or otherwise, under each Existing Loan Document and, to the extent such Person granted liens on or security interests in any of its properties pursuant to any such Existing Loan Document as security for the Borrower’s obligations under or with respect to the Financing Agreement, or its own obligations arising under any Existing Loan Document, hereby ratifies and reaffirms such grant of liens and security interests and confirms and agrees that such liens and security interests hereafter secure all of the Obligations, [[CV]]luding, without limitation, all additional Obligations resulting from the Financing Agreement, in each case as if each reference in such Existing Loan Documents to the obligations secured thereby are construed to hereafter mean and refer to such Obligations after giving effect to the Financing Agreement.

Each of the Loan Parties acknowledges that each of the Existing Loan Documents remains in full force and effect and is hereby ratified and confirmed.
