[[Date 1: Date]]  
This document is in reference to the Promissory Note dated and signed on [[Date 2: Date]] between DRS inc., with the new address of 8245 SE 36th St., [[Address 1: Address]] (address on note was 12900 NE 180th St. #200, Bothell, WA) and [[Party 1]], residing at 211 W. Prospect St., [[Address 2: Address]].

The note was originally set to expire and be paid on [[Date 3: Date]].

It has been mutually agreed upon that said note in the principal amount of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] will have the term extended for period of up to two additional years, with Mr. Wong having the right to call the loan with a 30 day notice. All other terms within the note document will remain the same.

The new expiration date of the note therefore will be [[Date 4: Date]], given Mr. Wong does not call the note prior to expiration.
